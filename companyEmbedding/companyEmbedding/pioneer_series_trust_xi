Basic information about the fund                                                

Investment objective                                                            
Reasonable income and capital growth.                                           

Principal investment strategies                                                 
The fund seeks to invest in a broad list of carefully selected, reasonably      
priced securities rather than in securities whose prices reflect a premium      
resulting from their current market popularity. The fund invests the major      
portion of its assets in equity securities, primarily of U.S. issuers. For      
purposes of the fund's investment policies, equity securities include common    
stocks, convertible debt and other equity instruments, such as exchange-traded  
funds (ETFs) that invest primarily in equity securities, depositary receipts,   
warrants, rights, equity interests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and 
preferred stocks.                                                               

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., the fund's investment adviser, uses a      
value approach to select the fund's investments. Using this investment style,   
Pioneer seeks securities selling at reasonable prices or at substantial         
discounts to their underlying values and then holds these securities until the  
market values reflect their intrinsic values. Pioneer evaluates a security's    
potential value, including the attractiveness of its market valuation, based on 
the company's assets and prospects for earnings and revenue growth. In making   
that assessment, Pioneer employs due diligence and fundamental research, an     
evaluation of the issuer based on its financial statements and operations,      
employing a bottom-up analytic style. Pioneer also considers a security's       
potential to provide a reasonable amount of income. Pioneer relies on the       
knowledge, experience and judgment of its staff and the staff of its affiliates 
who have access to a wide variety of research. Pioneer focuses on the quality   
and price of individual issuers, not on economic sector or market-timing        
strategies. Factors Pioneer looks for in selecting investments include:         
o Above average potential for earnings and revenue growth                       
o Favorable expected returns relative to perceived risks                        
o Management with demonstrated ability and commitment to the company            
o Low market valuations relative to earnings forecast, book value, cash flow    
and sales                                                                   
o Turnaround potential for companies that have been through difficult periods   
o Good prospects for dividend growth                                            

The fund primarily invests in securities of U.S. issuers. The fund may invest   
up to 25% of its total assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers. The fund will  
not invest more than 5% of its total assets in securities of emerging markets   
issuers.                                                                        

Principal risks of investing in the fund                                        
o You could lose money on your investment in the fund                           
o The values of securities held by the fund may fall due to general market      
conditions, such as real or perceived adverse economic, political or        
regulatory

conditions, inflation, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse     
investor sentiment. Adverse market conditions may be prolonged and may not  
have the same impact on all types of securities. The values of securities   
may fall due to factors affecting a particular issuer or sector or the      
securities market as a whole.                                               
o The stock market goes down or performs poorly relative to other investments   
(this risk may be greater in the short term)                                
o Value stocks fall out of favor with investors                                 
o The fund's investments remain undervalued or do not have the potential value  
originally expected                                                         
o Stocks selected for income or securities selected for capital appreciation do 
not perform as expected                                                     

Risks of non-U.S. investments                                                   
Investing in non-U.S. issuers may involve unique risks compared to investing in 
the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks are more pronounced for issuers in  
emerging markets or to the extent that the fund invests significantly in one    
region or country. These risks may include:                                     
o Less information about non-U.S. issuers or markets may be available due to    
less rigorous disclosure or accounting standards or regulatory practices    
o Many non-U.S. markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile. In a        
changing market, Pioneer may not be able to sell the fund's portfolio       
securities at times, in amounts and at prices it considers reasonable       
o Adverse effect of currency exchange rates or controls on the value of the     
fund's investments                                                          
o The economies of non-U.S. countries may grow at slower rates than expected or 
may experience a downturn or recession                                      
o Economic, political and social developments may adversely affect the          
securities markets                                                          
o Withholding and other non-U.S. taxes may decrease the fund's return           

Market segment risks                                                            
To the extent the fund emphasizes, from time to time, investments in a market   
segment, the fund will be subject to a greater degree to the risks particular   
to the industries in that segment, and may experience greater market            
fluctuation, than a fund without the same focus. For example, industries in the 
financial segment, such as banks, insurance companies, broker-dealers and real  
estate investment trusts (REITs), may be sensitive to changes in interest rates 
and general economic activity and are generally subject to extensive government 
regulation. Industries in the technology segment, such as information           
technology, communications equipment, computer hardware and software, and       
office and scientific equipment, are subject to risks of rapidly evolving       
technology, short product lives, rates of corporate expenditures, falling       
prices and profits, competition from new market entrants, and general economic  
conditions.

The fund's past performance                                                     
The bar chart and table indicate the risks of investing in the fund by showing  
how the fund has performed in the past. The fund's performance will vary from   
year to year.                                                                   

The fund's past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily       
indicate how it will perform in the future. As a shareowner, you may lose or    
make money on your investment.                                                  

Fund performance                                                                
The chart shows the year-by-year performance of the fund's Class A shares.      

Class B and Class C shares will have different performance because they have    
different expenses.                                                             

The chart does not reflect any sales charge you may pay when you buy or sell    
fund shares. Any sales charge will reduce your return.

Comparison with the Russell 1000 Value Index                                    
The table shows the average annual total returns for each class of the fund

After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual        
federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and    
local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation    
and may differ from those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not        
relevant to investors who hold fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements    
such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.                         

After-tax returns for Class B and Class C shares will vary from the after-tax   
returns presented for Class A shares.

This example helps you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost  
of investing in other mutual funds. It assumes that: a) you invest $10,000 in   
the fund for the time periods shown, b) you reinvest all dividends and          
distributions, c) your investment has a 5% return each year and d) the fund's   
operating expenses remain the same.                                             

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, under these assumptions your 
costs would be:

1  Class A purchases of $500,000 or more and purchases by participants in       
certain group plans are not subject to an initial sales charge but may be 
subject to a contingent deferred sales charge of 1%. See "Buying,
exchanging and selling shares."                                           

2  The fund pays a management fee that is adjusted upward or downward based on  
its performance relative to an index. The fund's basic fee before any     
performance adjustment is 0.60% of average daily net assets. This fee is  
reduced at asset levels above $5 billion. See "Management."               

3  Other expenses and total annual fund operating expenses have been restated   
based on an estimate of current expenses. Expenses will vary based on     
changes in the fund's net asset values. Total annual fund operating       
 expenses in the table have been reduced by any expense offset arrangements.

risks, you should obtain and read the statement of additional information       
(SAI).                                                                          

Debt securities                                                                 
The fund may invest in debt securities of corporate and government issuers.     
Generally the fund acquires debt securities that are investment grade, but the  
fund may invest up to 5% of its net assets in below investment grade debt       
securities issued by both U.S. and non-U.S. corporate and government issuers,   
including convertible debt securities. The fund invests in debt securities when 
Pioneer believes they are consistent with the fund's investment objective of    
reasonable income and capital growth, to diversify the fund's portfolio or for  
greater liquidity.                                                              

Debt securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet        
principal or interest payments on its obligations. Factors that could           
contribute to a decline in the market value of debt securities in the fund's    
portfolio include rising interest rates or a reduction in the perceived         
creditworthiness of the issuer of the securities. A debt security is investment 
grade if it is rated in one of the top four categories by a nationally          
recognized statistical rating organization or determined to be of equivalent    
credit quality by Pioneer. Debt securities rated below investment grade are     
commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative. Below      
investment grade debt securities involve greater risk of loss, are subject to   
greater price volatility and are less liquid, especially during periods of      
economic uncertainty or change, than higher quality debt securities.            

Investments in REITs                                                            
The fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in REITs. REITs are companies   
that invest primarily in real estate or real estate related loans. Investing in 
REITs involves unique risks. They are significantly affected by the market for  
real estate and are dependent upon management skills and cash flow. In addition 
to its own expenses, the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of   
any management and other expenses paid by REITs in which it invests.            

Derivatives                                                                     
The fund may, but is not required to, use futures and options on securities,    
indices and currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts and other   
derivatives. A derivative is a security or instrument whose value is determined 
by reference to the value or the change in value of one or more securities,     
currencies, indices or other financial instruments. Although there is no        
specific limitation on investing in derivatives, the fund does not use          
derivatives as a primary investment technique

Basic information about the fund                                                

and generally limits their use to hedging. However, the fund may use            
derivatives for a variety of purposes, including:                               
o As a hedge against adverse changes in the market prices of securities,        
interest rates or currency exchange rates                                   
o As a substitute for purchasing or selling securities                          
o To increase the fund's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be           
considered speculative                                                      

Derivatives may be subject to market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.  
The fund's use of certain derivatives may, in some cases, involve forms of      
financial leverage, which involves risk and may increase the volatility of the  
fund's net asset value. Even a small investment in derivatives can have a       
significant impact on the fund's exposure to the market prices of securities,   
interest rates or currency exchange rates. Therefore, using derivatives can     
disproportionately increase losses and reduce opportunities for gain. If        
changes in a derivative's value do not correspond to changes in the value of    
the fund's other investments or do not correlate well with the underlying       
asset, rate or index, the fund may not fully benefit from or could lose money   
on the derivative position. In addition, some derivatives involve risk of loss  
if the issuer of the derivative defaults on its obligation. Certain derivatives 
may be less liquid, which may reduce the returns of the fund if it cannot sell  
or terminate the derivative at an advantageous time or price. Some derivatives  
may involve the risk of improper valuation. The fund will only invest in        
derivatives to the extent Pioneer believes these investments are consistent     
with the fund's investment objective, but derivatives may not perform as        
intended. Suitable derivatives may not be available in all circumstances or at  
reasonable prices and may not be used by the fund for a variety of reasons.     

Cash management and temporary investments                                       
Normally, the fund invests substantially all of its assets to meet its          
investment objective. The fund may invest the remainder of its assets in        
securities with remaining maturities of less than one year or cash equivalents, 
or may hold cash. For temporary defensive purposes, including during periods of 
unusual cash flows, the fund may depart from its principal investment           
strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these securities or may hold 
cash. During such periods, the fund may not be able to achieve its investment   
objective. The fund may adopt a defensive strategy when Pioneer believes        
securities in which the fund normally invests have extraordinary risks due to   
political or economic factors and in other extraordinary circumstances.

Securities lending                                                              
The fund may lend securities in its portfolio to certain broker-dealers or      
other institutional investors under agreements which require that the loans be  
secured continuously by collateral, typically cash, which the fund will invest  
during the term of the loan. The fund will continue to have market risk and     
other risks associated with owning the securities on loan, as well as the risks 
associated with the investment of the cash collateral received in connection    
with the loan. Securities lending also is subject to other risks, including the 
risk that the borrower fails to return a loaned security, and/or there is a     
shortfall on the collateral posted by the borrower, and the risk that the fund  
is unable to recall a security in time to exercise valuable rights or sell the  
security.                                                                       

Short-term trading                                                              
The fund usually does not trade for short-term profits. The fund will sell an   
investment, however, even if it has only been held for a short time, if it no   
longer meets the fund's investment criteria. If the fund does a lot of trading, 
it may incur additional operating expenses, which would reduce performance, and 
could cause shareowners to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital    
gains.                                                                          

See "Financial highlights" for actual annual turnover rates.                    

Disclosure of portfolio holdings                                                
The fund's policies and procedures with respect to disclosure of the fund's     
portfolio securities are described in the statement of additional information.  

Reverse repurchase agreements and borrowing                                     
The fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements pursuant to which the     
fund transfers securities to a counterparty in return for cash, and the fund    
agrees to repurchase the securities at a later date and for a higher price.     
Reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings by the fund, are a form 
of leverage and may make the value of an investment in the fund more volatile   
and increase the risks of investing in the fund. This is because leverage       
generally magnifies the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the  
fund's underlying asset or creates investment risk with respect to a larger     
pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have. The fund also may borrow     
money from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. Entering into reverse 
repurchase agreements and other borrowing transactions may cause the fund to    
liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its     
obligations or meet segregation requirements.

Management                                                                      

Pioneer, the fund's investment adviser,                                         
selects the fund's investments and oversees the fund's operations.              

Pioneer is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A., one of the 
largest banking groups in Italy. Pioneer is part of the global asset management 
group providing investment management and financial services to mutual funds,   
institutional and other clients. As of December 31, 2008, assets under          
management were approximately $214 billion worldwide, including over $49        
billion in assets under management by Pioneer and its affiliates.               

Investment adviser                                                              
Pioneer's main office is at 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109. The   
firm's U.S. mutual fund investment history includes creating in 1928 one of the 
first mutual funds.                                                             

Pioneer has received an order from the Securities and Exchange Commission that  
permits Pioneer, subject to the approval of the fund's Board of Trustees, to    
hire and terminate a subadviser or to materially modify an existing subadvisory 
contract for the fund without shareholder approval. Pioneer retains the         
ultimate responsibility to oversee and recommend the hiring, termination and    
replacement of any subadviser. To the extent that the Securities and Exchange   
Commission adopts a rule that would supersede the order, or would provide       
greater flexibility than the order, Pioneer and the fund intend to rely on such 
rule to permit Pioneer, subject to the approval of the fund's Board of Trustees 
and any other applicable conditions of the rule, to hire and terminate a        
subadviser or to materially modify an existing subadvisory contract for the     
fund without shareholder approval.                                              

Portfolio management                                                            
Day-to-day management of the fund's portfolio is the responsibility of Rod      
Wright, lead portfolio manager. Mr. Wright is supported by Bradley T. Galko,    
portfolio manager, and the domestic equity team. Members of this team manage    
other Pioneer funds investing primarily in U.S. equity securities. The          
portfolio managers and the team also may draw upon the research and investment  
management expertise of the global research teams, which provide fundamental    
and quantitative research on companies and include members from Pioneer's       
affiliate, Pioneer Investment Management Limited. Mr. Wright is a senior vice   
president of Pioneer and strategy director of the value team. He joined Pioneer 
in 1994 as an analyst. Mr. Galko, a vice president, joined Pioneer in 2001 as a 
senior analyst.                                                                 

The fund's statement of additional information provides additional information  
about the portfolio managers' compensation, other accounts managed by the       
portfolio managers, and the portfolio managers' ownership of shares of the      
fund.

Management fee                                                                  

The fund pays Pioneer a fee for managing the fund and to cover the cost of      
providing certain services to the fund.                                         

Pioneer's fee varies based on:                                                  
o  (The fund's assets. Pioneer earns an annual basic fee equal to 0.60% of      
the) fund's average daily net assets up to $5 billion, 0.575% on the next 
$5 billion and 0.550% on the excess over $10 billion.                     
o  (The fund's performance. The investment performance of the fund is           
compared) to the Russell 1000 Value Index. The basic fee can increase or  
decrease by a maximum of 0.10%, depending on the performance of the fund's
Class A shares relative to the index. The performance comparison is made  
for a rolling 36-month period.                                            

Pioneer's fee increases or decreases depending upon whether the fund's          
performance is up and down more or less than that of the index during the       
rolling 36-month performance period. Each percentage point of difference        
between the performance of Class A shares and the index (to a maximum of +/-10  
percentage points) is multiplied by a performance rate adjustment of 0.01%. As  
a result, the maximum annualized rate adjustment is +/-0.10% for the rolling    
36-month performance period. In addition, Pioneer contractually limits any      
positive adjustment of the fund's management fee to 0.10% of the fund's average 
daily net assets on an annual basis (i.e. to a maximum annual fee of 0.70% after
the performance adjustment).                                                    

This performance comparison is made at the end of each month. An appropriate    
percentage of this rate (based on the number of days in the current month) is   
then applied to the fund's average net assets for the entire performance        
period, giving a dollar amount that will be added to (or subtracted from) the   
basic fee.                                                                      

Because the adjustment to the basic fee is based on the comparative performance 
of the fund and the performance record of the index, the controlling factor is  
not whether fund performance is up or down, but whether it is up or down more   
or less than the performance record of the index, regardless of general market  
performance. As a result, Pioneer could earn the maximum possible fee even if   
the fund's net asset value declines. Moreover, the comparative investment       
performance of the fund is based solely on the relevant performance period      
without regard to the cumulative performance over a longer or shorter period of 
time.                                                                           

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, the fund paid management fees     
equivalent to 0.47% of the fund's average daily net assets.                     

A discussion regarding the basis for the Board of Trustees' approval of the     
management contract is available in the fund's annual report to shareholders,   
for the period ended September 30, 2008.

Buying, exchanging and selling shares                                           

Net asset value                                                                 

The fund's net asset value is the value of its securities plus any other assets 
minus its accrued operating expenses and other liabilities. The fund calculates 
a net asset value for each class of shares every day the New York Stock         
Exchange is open when regular trading closes (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time). 

The fund generally values its securities using closing market prices or readily 
available market quotations. When closing market prices or market quotations    
are not available or are considered by Pioneer to be unreliable, the fund uses  
fair value methods to value its securities pursuant to procedures adopted by    
the Board of Trustees. Valuing securities using fair value methods may cause    
the net asset value of the fund's shares to differ from the net asset value     
that would be calculated only using market prices. For market prices and        
quotations, as well as for some fair value methods, the fund relies upon        
securities prices provided by pricing services.                                 

The fund uses fair value pricing methods for a security, including a non-U.S.   
security, when Pioneer determines that the closing market price on the primary  
exchange where the security is traded no longer accurately reflects the value   
of the security at the time the fund calculates its net asset value. This may   
occur for a variety of reasons that affect either the relevant securities       
markets generally or the specific issuer. For example, with respect to non-U.S. 
securities held by the fund, developments relating to specific events in the    
securities markets or the specific issuer may occur between the time the        
primary market closes and the time the fund determines its net asset value.     
International securities markets may be open on days when the U.S. markets are  
closed. For this reason, the values of any international securities owned by    
the fund could change on a day you cannot buy or sell shares of the fund.       

Certain types of securities, including those discussed in this paragraph, are   
priced using fair value pricing methods rather than market prices. The fund     
uses a pricing matrix to determine the value of fixed income securities that    
may not trade daily. A pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on  
the basis of current market prices for other debt securities and historical     
trading patterns in the market for fixed income securities. The fund values     
cash equivalent securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less at      
amortized cost. To the extent that the fund invests in the shares of other      
registered open-end investment companies that are not traded on an exchange     
(mutual funds), such shares are valued at their published net asset values per  
share as reported by the funds. The prospectuses of these funds explain the     
circumstances under which the funds will use fair value pricing methods to      
value their securities and the effects of using the fair value methodology.     

You buy or sell shares at the share price. When you buy Class A shares, you pay 
an initial sales charge unless you qualify for a waiver or reduced sales        
charge.

Choosing a class of shares                                                      
The fund offers three classes of shares through this prospectus. Each class has 
different sales charges and expenses, allowing you to choose the class that     
best meets your needs.                                                          

Factors you should consider include:                                            
o How long you expect to own the shares                                         
o The expenses paid by each class                                               
o Whether you qualify for any reduction or waiver of sales charges              

Your investment professional can help you determine which class meets your      
goals. Your investment firm may receive different compensation depending upon   
which class you choose. If you are not a U.S. citizen and are purchasing shares 
outside the U.S., you may pay different sales charges under local laws and      
business practices.                                                             

Distribution plan                                                               
The fund has adopted a distribution plan for each class of shares offered       
through this prospectus in accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the Investment      
Company Act of 1940. Under the plan, the fund pays distribution and service     
fees to the distributor. Because these fees are an ongoing expense of the fund, 
over time they increase the cost of your investment and your shares may cost    
more than shares that are subject to other types of sales charges.              

Additional payments to financial intermediaries                                 
There are two principal ways you compensate the financial intermediary through  
which you buy shares of the fund - directly, by the payment of sales            
commissions, if any; and indirectly, as a result of the fund paying Rule 12b-1  
fees. The fund also may pay intermediaries for administrative services and      
transaction processing.                                                         

Pioneer and its affiliates may make additional payments to your financial       
intermediary. These payments by Pioneer may provide your financial intermediary 
with an incentive to favor the Pioneer funds over other mutual funds or assist  
the distributor in its efforts to promote the sale of the fund's shares.        
Financial

intermediaries include broker-dealers, banks (including bank trust              
departments), registered investment advisers, financial planners, retirement    
plan administrators and other types of intermediaries.                          

Pioneer makes these additional payments (sometimes referred to as "revenue      
sharing") to financial intermediaries out of its own assets. Revenue sharing is 
not an expense of the Pioneer funds. Pioneer may base these payments on a       
variety of criteria, including the amount of sales or assets of the Pioneer     
funds attributable to the financial intermediary or as a per transaction fee.   

Not all financial intermediaries receive additional compensation and the amount 
of compensation paid varies for each financial intermediary. In certain cases,  
these payments may be significant. Pioneer determines which firms to support    
and the extent of the payments it is willing to make, generally choosing firms  
that have a strong capability to effectively distribute shares of the Pioneer   
funds and that are willing to cooperate with Pioneer's promotional efforts.     
Pioneer also may compensate financial intermediaries (in addition to amounts    
that may be paid by the fund) for providing certain administrative services and 
transaction processing services.                                                

Pioneer may benefit from revenue sharing if the intermediary features the       
Pioneer funds in its sales system (such as by placing certain Pioneer funds on  
its preferred fund list or giving access on a preferential basis to members of  
the financial intermediary's sales force or management). In addition, the       
financial intermediary may agree to participate in the distributor's marketing  
efforts (such as by helping to facilitate or provide financial assistance for   
conferences, seminars or other programs at which Pioneer personnel may make     
presentations on the Pioneer funds to the intermediary's sales force). To the   
extent intermediaries sell more shares of the Pioneer funds or retain shares of 
the Pioneer funds in their clients' accounts, Pioneer receives greater          
management and other fees due to the increase in the Pioneer funds' assets. The 
intermediary may earn a profit on these payments to the intermediary if the     
amount of the payment exceeds the intermediary's costs.                         

The compensation that Pioneer pays to financial intermediaries is discussed in  
more detail in the fund's statement of additional information. Your             
intermediary may charge you additional fees or commissions other than those     
disclosed in this prospectus. Intermediaries may categorize and disclose these  
arrangements differently than the discussion above and in the statement of      
additional information. You can ask your financial intermediary about any       
payments it receives from Pioneer or the Pioneer funds, as well as about fees   
and/or commissions it charges.                                                  

Pioneer and its affiliates may have other relationships with your financial     
intermediary relating to the provision of services to the Pioneer funds, such   
as providing omnibus account services or effecting portfolio transactions for   
the Pioneer funds. If your intermediary provides these services, Pioneer or the 
Pioneer funds may compensate the intermediary for these services. In addition,  
your intermediary may have other relationships with Pioneer or its affiliates   
that are not related to the Pioneer funds.

You pay the offering price when you buy Class A shares unless you qualify to    
purchase shares at net asset value. You pay a lower sales charge as the size of 
your investment increases. You do not pay a sales charge when you reinvest      
dividends or capital gain distributions paid by the fund. You do not pay a

The dollar amount of the sales charge is the difference between the offering    
price of the shares purchased (based on the applicable sales charge in the      
table) and the net asset value of those shares. Since the offering price is     
calculated to two decimal places using standard rounding methodology, the       
dollar amount of the sales charge as a percentage of the offering price and of  
the net amount invested for any particular purchase of fund shares may be       
higher or lower due to rounding.                                                

Reduced sales charges                                                           
You may qualify for a reduced Class A sales charge if you own or are purchasing 
shares of Pioneer mutual funds. The investment levels required to obtain a      
reduced sales charge are commonly referred to as "breakpoints." Pioneer offers  
two principal means of taking advantage of breakpoints in sales charges for     
aggregate purchases of Class A shares of the Pioneer funds over time if:        
o The amount of shares you own of the Pioneer funds plus the amount you are     
investing now is at least $50,000 (Rights of accumulation)                  
o You plan to invest at least $50,000 over the next 13 months (Letter of        
intent)                                                                     

Rights of accumulation                                                          
If you qualify for rights of accumulation, your sales charge will be based on   
the combined value (at the current offering price) of all your Pioneer mutual   
fund shares, the shares of your spouse and the shares of any children under the 
age of 21.

Buying, exchanging and selling shares                                           

Letter of intent                                                                
You can use a letter of intent to qualify for reduced sales charges in two      
situations:                                                                     
o If you plan to invest at least $50,000 (excluding any reinvestment of         
dividends and capital gain distributions) in the fund's Class A shares      
during the next 13 months                                                   
o If you include in your letter of intent the value (at the current offering    
price) of all of your Class A shares of the fund and Class A, Class B or    
Class C shares of all other Pioneer mutual fund shares held of record in the
amount used to determine the applicable sales charge for the fund shares you
plan to buy                                                                 

Completing a letter of intent does not obligate you to purchase additional      
shares, but if you do not buy enough shares to qualify for the projected level  
of sales charges by the end of the 13-month period (or when you sell your       
shares, if earlier), the distributor will recalculate your sales charge. You    
must pay the additional sales charge within 20 days after you are notified of   
the recalculation or it will be deducted from your account (or your sale        
proceeds). Any share class for which no sales charge is paid cannot be included 
under the letter of intent. For more information regarding letters of intent,   
please contact your investment professional or obtain and read the statement of 
additional information.

Qualifying for a reduced Class A sales charge                                   

In calculating your total account value in order to determine whether you have  
net sales charge breakpoints, you can include your Pioneer mutual fund shares,  
those of your spouse and the shares of any children under the age of 21.        
Pioneer will use each fund's current offering price to calculate your total     
account value. Certain trustees and fiduciaries may also qualify for a reduced  
sales charge.                                                                   

To receive a reduced sales charge, you or your investment professional must, at 
the time of purchase, notify the distributor of your eligibility. In order to   
verify your eligibility for a discount, you may need to provide your investment 
professional or the fund with information or records, such as account numbers   
or statements, regarding shares of the fund or other Pioneer mutual funds held  
in all accounts by you, your spouse or children under the age of 21 with that   
investment professional or with any other financial intermediary. Eligible      
accounts may include joint accounts, retirement plan accounts, such as IRA and  
401k accounts, and custodial accounts, such as ESA, UGMA and UTMA accounts.     

It is your responsibility to confirm that your investment professional has      
notified the distributor of your eligibility for a reduced sales charge at the  
time of sale. If you or your investment professional do not notify the          
distributor of your eligibility, you will risk losing the benefits of a reduced 
sales charge.                                                                   

For this purpose, Pioneer mutual funds include any fund for which the           
distributor is principal underwriter and, at the distributor's discretion, may  
include funds organized outside the U.S. and managed by Pioneer or an           
affiliate.                                                                      

You can locate information regarding the reduction or waiver of sales charges,  
in a clear and prominent format and free of charge, on Pioneer's website at     
www.pioneerinvestments.com. The website includes hyperlinks that facilitate     
access to this information.                                                     

Class A purchases at a reduced initial sales charge or net asset value are also 
available to:

o Participants in Optional Retirement Programs if (i) your employer has         
authorized a limited number of mutual funds to participate in the program,  
(ii) all participating mutual funds sell shares to program participants at  
net asset value, (iii) your employer has agreed in writing to facilitate    
investment in Pioneer mutual funds by program participants and (iv) the     
program provides for a matching contribution for each participant           
contribution;                                                               
o Participants in an employer-sponsored 403(b) plan or employer-sponsored 457   
plan if (i) your employer has made special arrangements for your plan to    
operate as a group through a single broker, dealer or financial intermediary
and (ii) all participants in the plan who purchase shares of a Pioneer      
mutual fund do so through a single broker, dealer or other financial

o Individuals receiving a distribution consisting of Class Y shares of a        
Pioneer fund from a trust, fiduciary, custodial or other similar account who

that agrees with the fund to distinguish beneficial holders in the same     
manner, and retirement plans with assets invested in the predecessor Safeco 
fund on that date.                                                          

In addition, Class A shares may be purchased at net asset value through certain 
mutual fund programs sponsored by qualified intermediaries, such as broker-     
dealers and investment advisers. In each case, the intermediary has entered     
into an agreement with Pioneer to include the Pioneer funds in their program    
without the imposition of a sales charge. The intermediary provides investors   
participating in the program with additional services, including advisory,      
asset allocation, recordkeeping or other services. You should ask your          
investment firm if it offers and you are eligible to participate in such a      
mutual fund program and whether participation in the program is consistent with 
your investment goals. The intermediaries sponsoring or participating in these  
mutual fund programs also may offer their clients other classes of shares of    
the funds and investors may receive different levels of services or pay         
different fees depending upon the class of shares included in the program.      
Investors should consider carefully any separate transaction and other fees     
charged by these programs in connection with investing in each available share  
class before selecting a share class.

Buying, exchanging and selling shares                                           

Reinstatement privilege for Class A and Class B shares                          
If you recently sold all or part of your Class A or Class B shares, you may be  
able to reinvest all or part of your sale proceeds without a sales charge in    
Class A shares of any Pioneer mutual fund. To qualify for reinstatement:        
o You must send a written request to the transfer agent no more than 90 days    
after selling your shares and                                               
o The registration of the account in which you reinvest your sale proceeds must 
be identical to the registration of the account from which you sold your    
shares.                                                                     

Your purchases pursuant to the reinstatement privilege are subject to           
limitations on investor transactions, including the limitation on the purchase  
of the fund's shares within 30 calendar days of a redemption. See "Excessive
trading."                                                                       

When you elect reinstatement, you are subject to the provisions outlined in the 
selected fund's prospectus, including the fund's minimum investment             
requirement. Your sale proceeds will be reinvested in shares of the fund at the 
Class A net asset value per share determined after the transfer agent receives  
your written request for reinstatement.                                         

You may realize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of   
your sale of fund shares, and special tax rules may apply if you elect          
reinstatement. Consult your tax adviser for more information.                   

Class A shares that are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge           

Purchases of Class A shares of $500,000 or more, or by participants in a group  
plan which were not subject to an initial sales charge, may be subject to a     
contingent deferred sales charge upon redemption. A contingent deferred sales   
charge is payable to the distributor in the event of a share redemption within  
12 months following the share purchase at the rate of 1% of the lesser of the   
value of the shares redeemed (exclusive of reinvested dividend and capital gain 
distributions) or the total cost of such shares. However, the contingent        
deferred sales charge is waived for redemptions of Class A shares purchased by  
an employer-sponsored retirement plan described under Section 401(a), 403(b) or 
457 of the Internal Revenue Code that has at least $500,000 in total plan       
assets (or that has 1,000 or more eligible employees for plans with accounts    
established with Pioneer on or before March 31, 2004).

Sales charges: Class B shares                                                   

You buy Class B shares at net asset value per share without paying an initial   
sales charge. However, if you sell your Class B shares within five years of     
purchase, you will pay the distributor a contingent deferred sales charge. The  
contingent deferred sales charge decreases as the number of years since your    
purchase increases.

Shares purchased prior to December 1, 2004 remain subject to the contingent     
deferred sales charges in effect at the time you purchased those shares. Shares 
purchased as part of an exchange or acquired as a result of a reorganization of 
another fund into the fund remain subject to any contingent deferred sales      
charge that applied to the shares you originally purchased.                     

Conversion to Class A shares                                                    
Class B shares automatically convert into Class A shares. This helps you        
because Class A shares pay lower expenses.                                      

Your Class B shares will convert to Class A shares eight years after the date   
of purchase except that:                                                        
o Shares purchased by reinvesting dividends and capital gain distributions will 
convert to Class A shares over time in the same proportion as other shares  
held in the account                                                         
o Shares purchased by exchanging shares from another fund will convert on the   
date that the shares originally acquired would have converted into Class A  
shares                                                                      

Currently, the Internal Revenue Service permits the conversion of shares to     
take place without imposing a federal income tax. Conversion may not occur if   
the Internal Revenue Service deems it a taxable event for federal tax purposes.

Paying the contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)                            
Several rules apply for Class B shares so that you pay the lowest             
possible CDSC.                                                                
o The CDSC is calculated on the current market value or the original cost of  
the shares you are selling, whichever is less                             
o You do not pay a CDSC on reinvested dividends or distributions              
 o If you sell only some of your shares, the transfer agent will first sell your
shares that are not subject to any CDSC and then the shares that you have 
owned the longest

You buy Class C shares at net asset value per share without paying an initial   
sales charge. However, if you sell your Class C shares within one year of       
purchase, you will pay the distributor a contingent deferred sales charge of 1% 
of the current market value or the original cost of the shares you are selling, 
whichever is less.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waiver or reduction of contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC)                 
It is your responsibility to confirm that your investment professional has      
notified the distributor of your eligibility for a reduced sales charge at the  
time of sale. If you or your investment professional do not notify the          
distributor of your eligibility, you will risk losing the benefits of a reduced 
sales charge.                                                                   

Class A, Class B and Class C shares                                             
The distributor may waive or reduce the CDSC for Class A shares that are        
subject to a CDSC or for Class B or Class C shares if:                          
o The distribution results from the death of all registered account owners or a

other third party. You may not be able to use the online transaction privilege

on the purchase of the fund's shares within 30 calendar days of a redemption.

Buying, exchanging and selling shares                                           

the fund's objective and policies and their acquisition is in the best          
interests of the fund. If the fund accepts your securities, they will be valued 
for purposes of determining the number of fund shares to be issued to you in    
the same way the fund will value the securities for purposes of determining its 
net asset value. For federal income tax purposes, you may be taxed in the same  
manner as if you sold the securities that you use to purchase fund shares for   
cash in an amount equal to the value of the fund shares that you purchase. Your 
broker may also impose a fee in connection with processing your purchase of     
fund shares with securities.                                                    

Minimum investment amounts                                                      
Your initial investment must be at least $1,000. Additional investments must be 
at least $100 for Class A shares and $500 for Class B or Class C shares. You    
may qualify for lower initial or subsequent investment minimums if you are      
opening a retirement plan account, establishing an automatic investment plan or 
placing your trade through your investment firm. The fund may waive the initial 
or subsequent investment minimums. Minimum investment amounts may be waived     
for, among other things, share purchases made through certain mutual fund       
programs (e.g., asset based fee program accounts) sponsored by qualified        
intermediaries, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, that have       
entered into an agreement with Pioneer.                                         

Maximum purchase amounts                                                        

Purchases of fund shares are limited to $49,999 for Class B shares and $499,999 
for Class C shares. These limits are applied on a per transaction basis. Class  
A shares are not subject to a maximum purchase amount.                          

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Retirement plan accounts                                                      
You can purchase fund shares through tax-deferred retirement plans for        
individuals, businesses and tax-exempt organizations.

Department at 1-800-622-0176.

Identity verification                                                           
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering      
activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify   
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When   
you open an account, you will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, 
and other information that will allow the fund to identify you.                 

The fund may close your account if we cannot adequately verify your identity.   
The redemption price will be the net asset value on the date of redemption.     

Exchanging                                                                      
You may exchange your shares for shares of the same class of another Pioneer    
mutual fund.                                                                    

Your exchange request must be for at least $1,000. The fund allows you to       
exchange your shares at net asset value without charging you either an initial  
or contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange. Shares you     
acquire as part of an exchange will continue to be subject to any contingent    
deferred sales charge that applies to the shares you originally purchased. When 
you ultimately sell your shares, the date of your original purchase will        
determine your contingent deferred sales charge.                                

Before you request an exchange, consider each fund's investment objective and   
policies as described in the fund's prospectus.                                 

Selling                                                                         
Your shares will be sold at net asset value per share next calculated after the 
fund or its authorized agent, such as a broker-dealer, receives your request in 
good order.                                                                     

If the shares you are selling are subject to a deferred sales charge, it will   
be deducted from the sale proceeds. The fund generally will send your sale      
proceeds by check, bank wire or electronic funds transfer. Normally you will be 
paid within seven days. If you recently sent a check to purchase the shares     
being sold, the fund may delay payment of the sale proceeds until your check    
has cleared. This may take up to 10 calendar days from the purchase date.       

If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account or certain IRAs, you    
may use any of the methods described below. If you are selling shares from a    
retirement account other than an IRA, you must make your request in writing.    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You generally will have to pay income taxes on a sale or an exchange.

Buying, exchanging and selling shares                                           

Buying shares                                                                   

Through your investment firm                                                    
Normally, your investment firm will send your purchase request to the fund's    
distributor and/or transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for     
more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the           
distributor, and may receive additional compensation from Pioneer, for your     
purchase of fund shares.                                                        

By phone or online                                                              
You can use the telephone or online purchase privilege if you have an existing  
non-retirement account. Certain IRAs can use the telephone purchase privilege.  
If your account is eligible, you can purchase additional fund shares by phone   
or online if:                                                                   
o You established your bank account of record at least 30 days ago              
o Your bank information has not changed for at least 30 days                    
o You are not purchasing more than $100,000 worth of shares per account per day 
o You can provide the proper account identification information                 

When you request a telephone or online purchase, the transfer agent will        
electronically debit the amount of the purchase from your bank account of       
record. The transfer agent will purchase fund shares for the amount of the      
debit at the offering price determined after the transfer agent receives your   
telephone or online purchase instruction and good funds. It usually takes three 
business days for the transfer agent to receive notification from your bank     
that good funds are available in the amount of your investment.                 

In writing, by mail                                                             
You can purchase fund shares for an existing fund account by mailing a check to 
the transfer agent. Make your check payable to the fund. Neither initial nor    
subsequent investments should be made by third party check, travelers check, or 
credit card check. Your check must be in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank. 
Include in your purchase request the fund's name, the account number and the    
name or names in the account registration.

Normally, your investment firm will send your request to sell shares to the     
fund's transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more            
information. The fund has authorized the distributor to act as its agent in the

have changed your address (for checks) or your bank information (for wires and  
transfers) in the last 30 days.

only if your account is registered in your name. Include in your request your   
name, your social security number, the fund's name, your fund account number,   
the class of shares to be sold, the dollar amount or number of shares to be

Buying, exchanging and selling shares

Excessive trading                                                               
Frequent trading into and out of the fund can disrupt portfolio management      
strategies, harm fund performance by forcing the fund to hold excess cash or to 
liquidate certain portfolio securities prematurely and increase expenses for    
all investors, including long-term investors who do not generate these costs.   
An investor may use short-term trading as a strategy, for example, if the       
investor believes that the valuation of the fund's portfolio securities for     
purposes of calculating its net asset value does not fully reflect the then     
current fair market value of those holdings. The fund discourages, and does not 
take any intentional action to accommodate, excessive and short-term trading    
practices, such as market timing. Although there is no generally applied        
standard in the marketplace as to what level of trading activity is excessive,  
we may consider trading in the fund's shares to be excessive for a variety of   
reasons, such as if:                                                            
o You sell shares within a short period of time after the shares were           
purchased;                                                                  
o You make two or more purchases and redemptions within a short period of time; 
o You enter into a series of transactions that indicate a timing pattern or     
strategy; or                                                                
o We reasonably believe that you have engaged in such practices in connection   
with other mutual funds.                                                    

The fund's Board of Trustees has adopted policies and procedures with respect   
to frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares by fund investors.         
Pursuant to these policies and procedures, we monitor selected trades on a      
daily basis in an effort to detect excessive short-term trading. If we          
determine that an investor or a client of a broker or other intermediary has    
engaged in excessive short-term trading that we believe may be harmful to the   
fund, we will ask the investor, broker or other intermediary to cease such      
activity and we will refuse to process purchase orders (including purchases by  
exchange) of such investor, broker, other intermediary or accounts that we      
believe are under their control. In determining whether to take such actions,   
we seek to act in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of the    
fund's shareholders.                                                            

While we use our reasonable efforts to detect excessive trading activity, there 
can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that market timers   
will not employ tactics designed to evade detection. If we are not successful,  
your return from an investment in the fund may be adversely affected.           
Frequently, fund shares are held through omnibus accounts maintained by         
financial intermediaries such as brokers and retirement plan administrators,    
where the holdings of multiple shareholders, such as all the clients of a       
particular broker or other intermediary, are aggregated. Our ability to monitor 
trading practices by investors purchasing shares through omnibus accounts may   
be limited and dependent upon the cooperation of the broker or other            
intermediary in taking steps to limit this type of activity.                    

The fund may reject a purchase or exchange order before its acceptance or the   
issuance of shares. The fund may also restrict additional purchases or          
exchanges

in an account. Each of these steps may be taken for any transaction, for any    
reason, without prior notice, including transactions that the fund believes are 
requested on behalf of market timers. The fund reserves the right to reject any 
purchase or exchange request by any investor or financial institution if the    
fund believes that any combination of trading activity in the account or        
related accounts is potentially disruptive to the fund. A prospective investor  
whose purchase or exchange order is rejected will not achieve the investment    
results, whether gain or loss, that would have been realized if the order were  
accepted and an investment made in the fund. A fund and its shareholders do not 
incur any gain or loss as a result of a rejected order. The fund may impose     
further restrictions on trading activities by market timers in the future.      

To limit the negative effects of excessive trading on the fund, the fund has    
adopted the following restriction on investor transactions. If an investor      
redeems $5,000 or more (including redemptions that are a part of an exchange    
transaction) from the fund, that investor shall be prevented (or "blocked")     
from purchasing shares of the fund (including purchases that are a part of an   
exchange transaction) for 30 calendar days after the redemption. This policy    
does not apply to systematic purchase or withdrawal plan transactions,          
transactions made through employer-sponsored retirement plans described under   
Section 401(a), 403(b) or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code or employee benefit  
plans, scheduled (Internal Revenue Code Section 72(t) election) or mandatory    
(required minimum distribution) withdrawals from IRAs, rebalancing transactions 
made through certain asset allocation or "wrap" programs, transactions by       
insurance company separate accounts or transactions by other funds that invest  
in the fund. This policy does not apply to purchase or redemption transactions  
of less than $5,000 or to the Pioneer money market funds.                       

We rely on financial intermediaries that maintain omnibus accounts to apply to  
their customers either the fund's policy described above or their own policies  
or restrictions designed to limit excessive trading of fund shares. However, we 
do not impose this policy at the omnibus account level.                         

Purchases pursuant to the reinstatement privilege (for Class A and Class B      
shares) are subject to this policy.                                             

Account options                                                                 
See the account application form for more details on each of the following      
options.                                                                        

Automatic investment plans                                                      
You can make regular periodic investments in the fund by setting up monthly     
bank drafts, government allotments, payroll deductions, a Pioneer Investomatic  
Plan and other similar automatic investment plans. You may use an automatic     
investment plan to establish a Class A share account with a small initial       
investment. If you

have a Class B or Class C share account and your balance is at least $1,000,    
you may establish an automatic investment plan.                                 

Pioneer Investomatic Plan                                                       
If you establish a Pioneer Investomatic Plan, the transfer agent will make a    
periodic investment in fund shares by means of a preauthorized electronic funds 
transfer from your bank account. Your plan investments are voluntary. You may   
discontinue your plan at any time or change the plan's dollar amount, frequency 
or investment date by calling or writing to the transfer agent. You should      
allow up to 30 days for the transfer agent to establish your plan.              

Automatic exchanges                                                             
You can automatically exchange your fund shares for shares of the same class of 
another Pioneer mutual fund. The automatic exchange will begin on the day you   
select when you complete the appropriate section of your account application or 
an account options form. In order to establish automatic exchange:              
o You must select exchanges on a monthly or quarterly basis                     
o Both the originating and receiving accounts must have identical registrations 
o The originating account must have a minimum balance of $5,000                 

You may have to pay income taxes on an exchange.                                

Distribution options                                                            
The fund offers three distribution options. Any fund shares you buy by          
reinvesting distributions will be priced at the applicable net asset value per  
share.                                                                          

(1) Unless you indicate another option on your account application, any         
dividends and capital gain distributions paid to you by the fund will   
automatically be invested in additional fund shares.                    

(2) You may elect to have the amount of any dividends paid to you in cash and   
any capital gain distributions reinvested in additional shares.         

(3) You may elect to have the full amount of any dividends and/or capital gain  
distributions paid to you in cash.                                      

Options (2) or (3) are not available to retirement plan accounts or accounts    
with a current value of less than $500.                                         

If your distribution check is returned to the transfer agent or you do not cash 
the check for six months or more, the transfer agent may reinvest the amount of 
the check in your account and automatically change the distribution option on   
your account to option (1) until you request a different option in writing. If  
the amount of a distribution check would be less than $10, the fund may         
reinvest the amount in additional shares of the fund instead of sending a       
check. Additional shares of the fund will be purchased at the then current net  
asset value.

Directed dividends                                                              
You can invest the dividends paid by one of your Pioneer mutual fund accounts   
in a second Pioneer mutual fund account. The value of your second account must  
be at least $1,000. You may direct the investment of any amount of dividends.   
There are no fees or charges for directed dividends. If you have a retirement   
plan account, you may only direct dividends to accounts with identical          
registrations.                                                                  

Systematic withdrawal plans                                                     
When you establish a systematic withdrawal plan for your account, the transfer  
agent will sell the number of fund shares you specify on a periodic basis and   
the proceeds will be paid to you or to any person you select. You must obtain a 
signature guarantee to direct payments to another person after you have         
established your systematic withdrawal plan. Payments can be made either by     
check or by electronic transfer to a bank account you designate.                

To establish a systematic withdrawal plan:                                      
o Your account must have a total value of at least $10,000 when you establish   
your plan                                                                   
o You must request a periodic withdrawal of at least $50                        
o You may not request a periodic withdrawal of more than 10% of the value of    
any Class B or Class C share account (valued at the time the plan is        
implemented)                                                                

These requirements do not apply to scheduled (Internal Revenue Code Section     
72(t) election) or mandatory (required minimum distribution) withdrawals from   
IRAs and certain retirement plans.                                              

Systematic sales of fund shares may be taxable transactions for you. While you  
are making systematic withdrawals from your account, you may pay unnecessary    
initial sales charges on additional purchases of Class A shares or contingent   
deferred sales charges.                                                         

Direct deposit                                                                  
If you elect to take dividends or dividends and capital gain distributions in   
cash, or if you establish a systematic withdrawal plan, you may choose to have  
those cash payments deposited directly into your savings, checking or NOW bank  
account.                                                                        

Voluntary tax withholding                                                       
You may have the transfer agent withhold 28% of the dividends and capital gain  
distributions paid from your fund account (before any reinvestment) and forward 
the amount withheld to the Internal Revenue Service as a credit against your    
federal income taxes. Voluntary tax withholding is not available for retirement 
plan accounts or for accounts subject to backup withholding.

If you have a hearing disability and access to TDD keyboard equipment, you can  
contact our telephone representatives with questions about your account by      
calling our TDD number between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Eastern time any weekday 
that the New York Stock Exchange is open.

The fund has a policy that protects the privacy of your personal information. A 
copy of Pioneer's privacy notice was given to you at the time you opened your   
account. The fund will send you a copy of the privacy notice each year. You may 
also obtain the privacy notice by calling the transfer agent or through         
Pioneer's website.                                                              

Shareowner account policies                                                     

Signature guarantees and other requirements                                     
You are required to obtain a signature guarantee when:                          
o Requesting certain types of exchanges or sales of fund shares                 
o Redeeming shares for which you hold a share certificate                       
o Requesting certain types of changes for your existing account                 

You can obtain a signature guarantee from most broker-dealers, banks, credit    
unions (if authorized under state law) and federal savings and loan             
associations. You cannot obtain a signature guarantee from a notary public.     

The Pioneer funds generally accept only medallion signature guarantees. A       
medallion signature guarantee may be obtained from a domestic bank or trust     
company, broker, dealer, clearing agency, savings association, or other         
financial institution that is participating in a medallion program recognized   
by the Securities Transfer Association. Signature guarantees from financial     
institutions that are not participating in one of these programs are not        
accepted as medallion signature guarantees. The fund may accept other forms of  
guarantee from financial intermediaries in limited circumstances.               

Fiduciaries and corporations are required to submit additional documents to     
sell fund shares.                                                               

Minimum account size                                                            
The fund requires that you maintain a minimum account value of $500. If you     
hold less than $500 in your account, the fund reserves the right to notify you  
that it intends to sell your shares and close your account. You will be given   
60 days from the date of the notice to make additional investments to avoid     
having your shares sold. This policy does not apply to certain qualified        
retirement plan accounts.

Telephone and website access                                                    
You may have difficulty contacting the fund by telephone or accessing           
pioneerinvestments.com during times of market volatility or disruption in       
telephone or Internet service. On New York Stock Exchange holidays or on days   
when the exchange closes early, Pioneer will adjust the hours for the telephone 
center and for online transaction processing accordingly. If you are unable to  
access pioneerinvestments.com or reach the fund by telephone, you should        
communicate with the fund in writing.                                           

Share certificates                                                              
The fund does not offer share certificates. Shares are electronically recorded. 
Any existing certificated shares can only be sold by returning your certificate 
to the transfer agent, along with a letter of instruction or a stock power (a   
separate written authority transferring ownership) and a signature guarantee.   

Other policies                                                                  
The fund and the distributor reserve the right to:                              
o reject any purchase or exchange order for any reason, without prior notice    
o charge a fee for exchanges or to modify, limit or suspend the exchange        
privilege at any time without notice. The fund will provide 60 days' notice 
of material amendments to or termination of the exchange privilege          
o revise, suspend, limit or terminate the account options or services available 
to shareowners at any time, except as required by the rules of the          
Securities and Exchange Commission                                          

The fund reserves the right to:                                                 
o suspend transactions in shares when trading on the New York Stock Exchange is 
closed or restricted, or when the Securities and Exchange Commission        
determines an emergency or other circumstances exist that make it           
impracticable for the fund to sell or value its portfolio securities        
o redeem in kind by delivering to you portfolio securities owned by the fund    
rather than cash. Securities you receive this way may increase or decrease  
in value while you hold them and you may incur brokerage and transaction    
charges and tax liability when you convert the securities to cash           
o charge transfer, shareholder servicing or similar agent fees, such as an      
account maintenance fee for small balance accounts, directly to accounts    
upon at least 30 days' notice. The fund may do this by deducting the fee    
from your distribution of dividends and/or by redeeming fund shares to the  
extent necessary to cover the fee

Dividends, capital gains and taxes                                              

Dividends and capital gains                                                     
The fund generally pays any distributions of net short- and long-term capital   
gains in November. The fund generally pays dividends from any net investment    
income in June and December. The fund may also pay dividends and capital gain   
distributions at other times if necessary for the fund to avoid U.S. federal    
income or excise tax. If you invest in the fund shortly before a distribution,  
generally you will pay a higher price per share and you will pay taxes on the   
amount of the distribution whether you reinvest the distribution in additional  
shares or receive it as cash.                                                   

Taxes                                                                           
You will normally have to pay federal income taxes, and any state or local      
taxes, on the dividends and other distributions you receive from the fund,      
whether you take the distributions in cash or reinvest them in additional       
shares. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, distributions from the fund's net 
capital gains (if any) are considered long-term capital gains and may be        
taxable to you at reduced rates depending upon their source and other factors.  
Distributions from the fund's net short-term capital gains are taxable as       
ordinary income. Other dividends are taxable either as ordinary income or, for  
taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010, if so designated by the 
fund and certain other conditions, including holding period requirements, are   
met by the fund and the shareholder, as "qualified dividend income" taxable to  
individual shareholders at a maximum 15% U.S. federal income tax rate.          

"Qualified dividend income" generally is income derived from dividends from     
U.S. corporations or certain foreign corporations that are either incorporated  
in a U.S. possession or eligible for tax benefits under certain U.S. income tax 
treaties. In addition, dividends that the fund receives in respect of stock of  
certain foreign corporations may be "qualified dividend income" if that stock   
is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market.                   

A portion of dividends received from the fund (but none of the fund's capital   
gain distributions) may qualify for the dividends-received deduction for        
corporations.                                                                   

If the fund declares a dividend in October, November or December, payable to    
shareholders of record in such a month, but pays it in January of the following 
year, you will be taxed on the dividend as if you received it in the year in    
which it was declared.                                                          

When you sell or exchange fund shares you will generally recognize a capital    
gain or capital loss in an amount equal to the difference between the net       
amount of sale proceeds (or, in the case of an exchange, the fair market value  
of the shares) that you receive and your tax basis for the shares that you sell 
or exchange.

Dividends, capital gains and taxes                                              

You must provide your social security number or other taxpayer identification   
number to the fund along with the certifications required by the Internal       
Revenue Service when you open an account. If you do not or if it is otherwise   
legally required to do so, the fund will withhold 28% "backup withholding" tax  
from your dividends and other distributions, sale proceeds and any other        
payments to you that are subject to backup withholding.                         

You should ask your tax adviser about any federal, state, local and foreign tax 
considerations relating to an investment in the fund. You may also consult the  
fund's statement of additional information for a more detailed discussion of    
the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may affect the fund and its     
shareowners.

The financial highlights table helps you understand                             
the fund's financial performance for the past five years.                       

Certain information reflects financial results for a single fund share. The     
total returns in the table represent the rate that you would have earned or     
lost on an investment in Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the fund        
(assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions).                     

The information below has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the fund's         
independent registered public accounting firm, whose report is included in the  
fund's annual report along with the fund's financial statements. The annual

Re:      Pioneer II                         

Ladies and Gentlemen:                                                           

                  We have acted as  special  Delaware  counsel to Pioneer  II, a
Delaware  business  trust (the  "Trust"),  in  connection  with certain  matters
relating to the  formation of the Trust and the issuance of Shares of beneficial
interest in the Trust.  Capitalized  terms used herein and not otherwise  herein
defined are used as defined in the  Agreement  and  Declaration  of Trust of the
Trust dated April 2, 1996 (the "Governing Instrument").                         

                  In rendering  this  opinion,  we have  examined  copies of the
following  documents,  each in the form provided to us: the Certificate of Trust
of the Trust as filed in the  Office of the  Secretary  of State of the State of
Delaware  (the  "Recording  Office") on April 8, 1996 (the  "Certificate");  the
Governing  Instrument;  the  By-laws of the Trust;  certain  resolutions  of the
Trustees  of  the  Trust;  an  Adoption  Of And  Amendment  To  Notification  Of
Registration to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about
May 1, 1996 by which the Trust will adopt the Notification of Registration Filed
Pursuant to Section 8(a) of the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 on Form N-8A of
Pioneer II, a Massachusetts business trust;  Post-Effective  Amendment No. 45 to
the  Registration  Statement  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 on Form N-1A of
Pioneer II, a  Massachusetts  business trust, by which the Trust will adopt such
Registration  Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission

in the Governing Instrument, and compliance with the other terms, conditions and
restrictions   set  forth  in  the  Governing   Instrument  and  all  applicable
resolutions  of the  Trustees of the Trust in  connection  with the  issuance of

of any  registration  or  offering  documentation  relating  to the Trust or the
Shares.  As to any facts material to our opinion,  other than those assumed,  we
have relied without independent investigation on the above-referenced  documents
and on the accuracy, as of the date hereof, of the matters therein contained.

April 29, 1996

                  Based on and  subject  to the  foregoing,  and  limited in all
respects to matters of Delaware law, it is our opinion that:                    

                  1. The Trust is a duly organized and validly existing business
trust in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.                 

                  2. The Shares,  when issued to Shareholders in accordance with
the terms,  conditions,  requirements  and procedures set forth in the Governing
Instrument, will constitute legally issued, fully paid and non-assessable Shares
of beneficial interest in the Trust.

April 29, 1996

                  3.  Under  the  Delaware  Act and the  terms of the  Governing
Instrument, each Shareholder of the Trust, in such capacity, will be entitled to
the same  limitation of personal  liability as that extended to  stockholders of
private  corporations for profit organized under the general  corporation law of
the State of  Delaware;  provided,  however,  that we express  no  opinion  with
respect to the  liability of any  Shareholder  who is, was or may become a named
Trustee of the Trust.  Neither the  existence  nor exercise of the voting rights
granted to Shareholders under the Governing  Instrument will, of itself, cause a
Shareholder  to be  deemed a  trustee  of the  Trust  under  the  Delaware  Act.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing or the opinion expressed in paragraph 2 above, we
note that,  pursuant to Section 2 of Article VIII of the  Governing  Instrument,
the  Trustees  have the  power  to  cause  Shareholders,  or  Shareholders  of a
particular  Series,  to pay certain  custodian,  transfer,  servicing or similar
agent charges by setting off the same against  declared but unpaid  dividends or
by reducing Share ownership (or by both means).                                 

                  We  understand  that  you  are  currently  in the  process  of
registering or qualifying Shares in the various states, and we hereby consent to
the filing of a copy of this opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission
as part of the Post-Effective  Amendment and with the securities  administrators
of such states.  In giving this  consent,  we do not thereby  admit that we come
within the category of persons whose consent is required  under Section 7 of the
Securities  Act of  1933,  as  amended,  or the  rules  and  regulations  of the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  thereunder.  Except as  provided  in this
paragraph,  the opinion set forth above is  expressed  solely for the benefit of
the  addressee  hereof and may not be relied upon by, or filed  with,  any other
person or entity for any purpose without our prior written consent.             

            Sincerely,

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (the "Adviser"), each fund's investment
adviser, is currently an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A.
("UniCredit"). On April 23, 2015, UniCredit announced that it signed a
preliminary and exclusive agreement with Banco Santander and affiliates of
Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic (the "Private Equity Firms") with respect
to Pioneer Investments ("Pioneer") and Santander Asset Management ("SAM") (the
"Transaction").


Pursuant to the preliminary agreement, the Transaction will entail the
establishment of a holding company, with the name Pioneer Investments, to be
owned by UniCredit (50%) and the Private Equity Firms (50% between them). The
holding company will control Pioneer's U.S. operations, including





the Adviser. The holding company also will own 66.7% of Pioneer's and SAM's
combined operations outside the U.S., while Banco Santander will own directly
the remaining 33.3% stake. The completion of the Transaction is subject to the
signing of a definitive agreement, as well as certain regulatory and corporate
approvals, and other conditions.


Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, completion of the Transaction will
cause each fund's current investment advisory agreement with the Adviser to
terminate. In connection with the Transaction, each fund's Board of Trustees
will be asked to approve a new investment advisory agreement for each fund. If
approved by the Board, each fund's new investment advisory agreement will be
submitted to the shareholders of the fund for their approval.
