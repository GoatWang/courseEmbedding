        		General description
				
				

        This proficiency testing sample is produced in accordance with ISO/IEC 17043:2010. All information regarding the use of this material can be found in the reporting packet supplied for each sample.
        

        		Other Notes
				
				

        Proficiency testing samples are presented as single blind. No values for the samples are released until the testing period concludes. Values of analytes vary lot to lot.Proficiency Testing Schedule (2016-2017)SoilsLPTP16-S1 February 3 - March 18, 2016LPTP16-S2 April 13 - May 27, 2016LPTP16-S3 July 20 - September 2, 2016LPTP16-S4 October 5 - November 18, 2016LPTP17-S1 February 1 - March 17, 2017LPTP17-S2 April 12 - May 26, 2017LPTP17-S3 July 26 - September 8, 2017 LPTP17-S4 October 11 - November 24, 2017Quick-Turn Study - (non-scheduled proficiency test that is available at any time)

        		Preparation Note
				
				

        The PT sample is a soil containing total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). The sample size provided is 100 g of soil. The soil has been sterilized to minimize degradation of the sample. The PT sample has been sized to 100 mesh. The evaluation of results will be based on study statistics as required by NELAC. The sample has been intentionally prepared with an apparent headspace.Sample PreparationThe soil is to be extracted and analyzed using an appropriate extraction and analytical method for TPH, assuming a high concentration sample. Mix well. No particle size reduction is necessary. List the extraction technique and analytical method used for analysis of this sample. Using the selected extraction technique and determinative methods, determine the concentration of TPH in the sample and report your results as mg/Kg on a dry weight basis on the analysis data sheet provided. Do not correct the analytical results for matrix spike recovery bias. Determine moisture content and report on a dry weight basis.

 Step By Step Guide To SPE Method Development 

 The first decision that needs to be made is what the final analysis will be for the analyte. This will have an impact on the sample and cartridge size, as well as the final elution solvent. Gas chromatography offers higher sensitivity than HPLC, while HPLC is better suited for ionisable species and very high molecular weights. If LC-MS is available, minimal sample clean-up may be required.

 Q&A

SPE column capacity
01 July 2013
Question: What is the maximum capacity of an SPE column?
Answer: The capacity of a sorbent is defined as the total mass of strongly retained analyte that can be retained by a given mass of the sorbent under optimum conditions.
For most sorbents, this can range from 1-5% by weight. 100 mg of sorbent might retain 1-5 mg of analyte.
Ion exchange sorbents typically have a capacity of 0.3-1 meq/g.

        		Preparation Note
				
				

        The prepared PT sample is a soil containing petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). The sample size provided is 60g of soil. The soil has been sterilized to minimize degradation of the sample.Sample PreparationThis is a two part sample including a fortification ampule and a blank soil. To prepare, weight 10.0 grams of blank soil and transfer to your extraction vessel. Open ampule SPE-026TX-L and transfer 1.0mL of concentration using a Class A pipet to your extraction vessel. The liquid should be applied directly to the soil this will minimize evaporation losses. Analyze using Method TX 1005 or TX 1006. A modified report form can be obtained for method TX 1006 by contacting RTC.

Significance and Use The presence and concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons, as well as oil and grease, in domestic and industrial wastewater is of concern to the public because of its deleterious aesthetic effect and its impact on aquatic life. Regulations and standards have been established that require monitoring of total petroleum hydrocarbons as well as oil and grease in water and wastewater.

1. Scope
1.1 This test method covers the determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in water, and waste water, that are extractable from an acidified sample with a cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon (for example cyclohexane), and measured by IR absorption in the region of 1370 -1380 cm-1 (7.25 -7.30 microns). Polar substances are removed by clean-up with Florisil. 1.2 The method also considers the volatile fraction of petroleum hydrocarbons which is lost by gravimetric methods that require solvent evaporation prior to weighing, as well as by solventless IR methods that require drying of the employed solid phase material prior to measurement. Similarly, a more complete fraction of extracted petroleum hydrocarbon is accessible by this method as compared to GC methods that use a time window for quantification, as petroleum hydrocarbons eluting outside these windows are also quantified. 1.3 This method defines oil and grease in water and wastewater as that which is extractable in the test method and measured by IR absorption in the region of 1370-1380 cm-1  (7.25 – 7.30 microns). 1.4 This method covers the range of 0.5 to 1000 mg/L and may be extended to a lower or higher level by extraction of a larger or smaller sample volume collected separately. 1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as standard. No other units of measurement are included in this standard. 1.6 This standard does not  purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.  It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate  safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory  limitations prior to use.
