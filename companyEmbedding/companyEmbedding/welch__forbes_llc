Welch & Forbes
Client
Case Studies 










Welch & Forbes has a long tradition of excellence in serving our clients. The value we bring to each relationship extends well beyond our investment expertise. The following case studies exemplify how we differentiate ourselves as stewards of our client’s financial and personal affairs. Our professionals, whether they are portfolio managers, tax managers or estate settlement managers, consistently aim to make a difference in their client’s lives. These stories are evidence of that guiding principle.

Exceptional Client Service – 24/7
A valued client received a call late on Thanksgiving evening a few years ago from a person stating he was from Social Security Administration and needed to verify her checking account information. The client did not question the legitimacy of this request and gave the person the information. Upon reflection and subsequently trying to call the number the person left and receiving the message “number not in service” she became very nervous she had fallen victim of a scam and called the Client Service Manager at Welch & Forbes whom she had known for many years and whom she named on her Durable Power of Attorney.
The next morning the Manager was able to speak with the bank manager and using her Power of Attorney placed a freeze on the account. On Saturday morning the Manager picked up the client at her home and brought her to the bank to assist her in closing her account and opening a new account.

An Integrated Solution for Substantial Wealth
An ultra high net worth client became widowed in 2011. The newly increased tax exclusion amount of $5 Million (as of 2011) was exhausted by passing assets to various beneficiaries. This amount was exempt from estate and gift taxes. Considerable assets were remaining in the widow’s estate.
The Portfolio Manager determined the best strategy for protecting these assets by assessing the widow’s need for income, her time horizon and her tolerance for risk. Then he looked at specific stocks in the estate of the deceased, as well as the holdings in the marital and family trusts.
The specific estate planning strategies that he implemented included 1) a real estate trust for the family’s vacation home, 2) a charitable trust for her favorite cultural and educational institutions, and 3) a generation skipping trust to benefit her grandchildren.

Consolidating Various Family Office Services
In early 2001 an entrepreneur in her 50s, who had sold the family business to a major national public company, was looking for a solution to the family financial matters.
Up to that point, the family’s investment accounts were held at a major international brokerage house. Real estate mortgages were collateralized with bonds held at a major national bank, children’s trusts were managed at a Boston law firm, and tax preparation services provided by another company. The client needed a firm that could coordinate and consolidate the necessary services all under one roof.
A Portfolio Manager at Welch & Forbes established and manages six family accounts: first, a revocable trust for the entrepreneur consisting of stocks, bonds and some private equity; second, an irrevocable life insurance trust; third, three gift trusts for each of her children, and lastly, an IRA.
In addition to the trust and investment management roles, the Tax Department at Welch & Forbes has assumed responsibility for preparation and filing our client’s state and federal tax returns as well as making quarterly tax estimate payments.
Finally, through our close association with a boutique law firm, the Portfolio Manager arranged for preparation and routine updating of the client’s trusts, wills and health care proxy documents.

Portfolio Review and Fiduciary Oversight
A client of Welch & Forbes is a beneficiary of a sizable trust ($16 Million) that was established by her late husband. This trust is managed by an outside investment manager at the request of the husband. An investment committee oversees the trust and its management, consisting of two Welch & Forbes Portfolio Managers and one outside Trust and Estates attorney that the firm has worked with for years.
The trust is reviewed at least annually by a representative from the outside manager along with one or more of the investment committee members. In a recent meeting, a committee member inquired as to the fees being assessed for the trust.
In keeping with his fiduciary duty to his client, the Portfolio Manager estimated the fees that should have been assesed to the trust.
The Portfolio Manager reported to the committee that the trust had been overcharged a total of $140,955.76 by the outside investment manager. This amount was reimbursed to the trust with appropriate interest.

Tax Planning: Charitable Giving Solutions
Our client has an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and is over 70 ½ years old. Because of her age she must take a required minimum distribution from the IRA. The amount of her 2010 required minimum distribution is $16,099. She has made a pledge of $30,000 over two years to one of her favorite charities. She has sufficient income from other sources to fulfill her pledge.
A Tax Accountant at Welch & Forbes suggested that she partially fulfill her pledge to the charity by having the custodian of the IRA make her 2010 distribution directly to the charity. The Tax Accountant worked with the custodian and our client to insure that the entire required minimum distribution was paid to the charity.
This action met our client’s required minimum distribution, reduced her federal income tax and fulfilled her charitable desires.

Tax Planning: Life’s Changes
In 2012, the federal tax code allowed married filing jointly taxpayers to exclude $500,000 of gain when they sell their principal residence. If one spouse should die, the code allows the surviving spouse to use the $500,000 exclusion for two years after the deceased spouse’s date of death. After the two year period expires, the surviving spouse’s exclusion decreases to $250,000.
Our client, a recent widow, decided to sell her principal residence and move to a retirement community.
Due to a challenging real estate market, our client was unsure when to sell. She was also concerned about which offer she might accept because of the differing tax consequences of the sale.
The Tax Department provided her with a schedule that estimated the tax impact on the sale proceeds at different price levels using the $500,000 exclusion and, in the event that the sale was delayed, the tax impact using the $250,000 exclusion.
This schedule helped the client determine the optimum timing and price level of the sale of her principal residence.

Estate Settlement: Peace of Mind
A Welch & Forbes client passed away unexpectedly leaving a spouse who was not only overwhelmed with grief but also was inundated with post-death paperwork and the numerous complexities of handling the finances which she had never had to deal with before.
Welch & Forbes has an Estate Settlement Department to handle tasks as small as changing names on accounts and cancelling credit cards to the very complex task of timely filing detailed estate tax returns with our Tax Department. Throughout the process of settling her husband’s estate, various individuals at Welch & Forbes assisted the spouse with consolidating her own affairs, updating her will and eventually selling her large home in exchange for a more manageable one.

Estate Settlement: Unusual Final Wishes
A long time Welch & Forbes client passed away leaving a very complex estate to settle and no family heirs. The client’s many possessions ranged from having little to no value to extremely valuable. Along with his many personal items, he left pages of instructions expressing his final wishes.
The Estate Settlement Manager carried out his every last wish that included finding his dog a home and selecting his burial attire. The Manager emptied his house and sold his possessions to the appropriate parties to ensure the estate received the most money possible to bequest to the charity of his choice. Settling this estate involved numerous trips to and from his home and many tedious hours in order to get it done the way the client wanted.
Knowing we can serve our clients even after they have passed on is truly fulfilling and is part of the great service we pride ourselves on.

About AMG 


AMG OverviewPhilosophyHistoryClientsProductsAMG FundsAMG Wealth PartnersAffiliatesManagement Team





Back to AMG WP AffiliatesWelch & Forbes LLCAdvisory ServicesWelch & Forbes LLC offers a broad range of investment and fiduciary services related to the management of assets. Welch & Forbes' investment philosophy is premised on the assumption that the cost of living will continue to rise and that the real purchasing power of financial assets will shrink over time unless an appropriate investment strategy is implemented to combat the impact of inflation. Therefore, the firm’s goal is to direct clients' funds into investments which can produce a steadily rising stream of income while also appreciating in value.

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line.

There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool. Answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from. It doesn't matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion.
