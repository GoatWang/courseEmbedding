NEW YORK, April 4, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Medley Capital LLC ("Medley") announces the acquisition of credit hedge fund manager Viathon Capital LP and related entities ("Viathon"), effective March 31, 2011.
Medley, founded in 2005 by Managing Partners Brook Taube, Seth Taube and Andrew Fentress, provides capital and advisory services to middle market corporate and asset based borrowers in North America.  Medley is a registered investment adviser with $1.4 billion of assets under management in private investment funds, hedge funds and Medley Capital Corporation (NYSE:   MCC), a business development company.
Viathon, founded in 2006 by Robert Comizio, invests in fundamental and event driven opportunities across the credit spectrum.  Predominantly focused on companies in North America and Europe, Viathon identifies both long and short investments throughout an issuer's capital structure.  Prior to founding Viathon, Mr. Comizio was a Senior Portfolio Manager at Marathon Asset Management in the Special Opportunity Fund.  He began his career at Goldman Sachs after receiving an MBA from the University of Chicago and after graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.  Mr. Comizio will become a Partner and the Senior Portfolio Manager for Medley Credit Strategies, LLC.  
"This transaction combines the analytical and credit strengths of the two organizations.  As a capital solutions provider to the middle market, the addition of Rob and his team will further enhance our debt and credit focused investment process and provides broader market perspectives and opportunities to both the borrower community and to our investors," said Brook Taube, Managing Partner at Medley. 
"Having known the Medley team for some time, I am excited about the opportunity to leverage our combined resources and to grow the firm's investment management and advisory franchise," added Robert Comizio.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
