        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREThe stats alone are mind-boggling: 16,000 square feet, nine full bathrooms, eight bedrooms sitting on two acres, listed for a cool $14.9 million.Then there's the world-class architecture, outdoor pool, lush gardens, 10,000-bottle wine cellar, heated bathroom and outdoor balcony floors, and more.The stunning Belle Meade property was even used for a Miranda Lambert photo shoot for this month's People magazine country issue."The second you walk in the house, you're not in Nashville, Tennessee," said co-agent Laura Stroud, "you're in Europe."The house was built in the 2000s by businessman Keith Pitts and his socialite wife, Deby Pitts, who built it to move Keith Pitts' father in along with the couple's three preteen and teen children.The elder Pitts needed a home that was handicapped accessible, and Deby Pitts said finding an existing one in Nashville proved difficult.So she and her husband built their own."It was created out of our love for Keith's dad — and a desire to have a wine cellar that got out of control," Deby Pitts said, laughing.Once she assembled a world-class architect/design/construction team, Deby Pitts said, the home became so much more."It's a magical, happy place," she said. "We expected to be here the rest of our lives."But only six years later, Keith Pitts' company was acquired by another, and as part of the deal, he must relocate to Dallas.And so Nashville has one of its most opulent and expensive listings in real estate history.To be sure, there are others. Socialite Sylvia Roberts has her Forest Hills home — which serves as country singer Rayna Jaymes' home on the ABC drama "Nashville" — listed for $19 million.And at those prices, the potential buyers pool is small. Very small.So how do agents find buyers?"We have to speak that language fluently," Stroud said of her and her real-estate selling partner, Lisa Wilson. "We have to be able to understand every facet, feature, bell and whistle, and make sure anyone who can afford it and has the taste to appreciate it knows it's available."Back to that wine cellar."It's magnificent," Deby Pitts said simply."Made from redwood, the shelving is done in a way that looks like the inside of an ocean liner from the '30s with curved shelves and walls."Her other favorite places: the upper terrace behind the salon, the library with Cuban mahogany wood, the master bathroom with floor-to-ceiling French vanilla marble, and the kitchen."I love the kitchen because that's where we live, the kitchen and breakfast room," Deby Pitts said."I have so many fond memories. We love to cook and we've had a lot of fun there."To learn moreThe home at 625 Westview Ave. in Belle Meade is on the market for $14.9 million.
