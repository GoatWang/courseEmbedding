Publisher's Description▼▲
Every human navigates life with a set of beliefs. The belief system is molded from information and experiences a person has been exposed to. A person success or demise in life depends on his belief system. If his belief system is messed up, his life will be messed up. No one can perform above his knowledge or revelation; people perish everyday due to a lack of knowledge. Life can only be changed when a person is exposed to the truth, accepts the truth, and practices the truth. Every human being is responsible for all three steps in dealing with the truth. This book offers you an opportunity to learn in 3 hours what it takes most believers to learn in 5 years. This book has the potential to change your life: If you have not yet experienced the love of God, this book is for you. If you want to accelerate your knowledge in Christ, this book is for you. If you want to grow in Christ, this book is for you. If you want to know your benefits in Christ, this book is for you. If you want to lead someone to Christ, give this book to him or her. Dr. Annuel Lebrun is a pastor and a medical doctor who is passionate about God's kingdom. His vision is to see souls come to Christ, and equip them to be effective members in the kingdom of God. Dr. Lebrun is blessed with a beautiful wife, Eliane D. Lebrun, and their two children, Emmanuela, and Annuel Joel Jr. Dr. Lebrun has been a minister for more than twenty years and pioneered a few churches. He also loves to see God's people prosper in every area of life.

From the creators of God's Not Dead! When a local pastor is shaken to the core by the visible faith of an elderly street-corner preacher, he's reminded that true belief always requires action. His response ignites a faith-fueled journey that powerfully impacts everybody it touches in ways that only God can orchestrate.  Rated PG-13. Dove approved (12+). Approx. 120 minutes.

 From the studio that brought you War Room and Miracles from Heaven comes a captivating new film!  All Saints is based on the inspiring true story of salesman-turned-pastor Michael Spurlock (John Corbett, My Big Fat Greek Weeding), the tiny church he was ordered to shut down, and a group of refugees from Southeast Asia. Together, they risked everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all. Look for it in theaters nationwide August 25!
