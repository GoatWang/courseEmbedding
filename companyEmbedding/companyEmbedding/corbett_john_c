Early life[edit]
Corbett was born on May 9, 1961 in Wheeling, West Virginia, the son of Sandy and John Corbett. He grew up in an apartment block near the Ohio River in West Virginia, with his mother, a waitress who worked in his uncle's music club.[2] His mother was of part Russian Jewish descent,[3] though Corbett was raised Catholic.[4] He attended Wheeling Central Catholic High School, where he graduated in 1979.[5] He started playing the guitar at age seven, and at 16 he had a job as a security guard at the Capitol Music Hall.[6] Following his graduation from high school, Corbett moved to California and worked in a steel factory for six years.[7] During his time as a boilermaker in the factory, Corbett spent a year training to become an L.A. County Deputy Sheriff, but ultimately failed.[8] He stopped working at the factory when he got injured, and went to Cerritos College in Norwalk, California. There, he took acting classes and studied hair dressing for a year.[9] Corbett said: "I went to hair school by day and studied theatre at night."[10] He has been a licensed hair stylist since 1986.[11] He then landed a Samsung commercial, and after three years he had starred in 50 national commercials.[12]
Career[edit]




Corbett at the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1992


Corbett's first major role was as the hippie boyfriend of Karen Arnold in season one, episode 4 ("Angel"), of The Wonder Years in 1988. For this appearance, he was credited as Jack Corbett. He has co-starred in three successful television series to date: Northern Exposure from 1990 to 1995, Sex and the City from 2001 to 2002, and United States of Tara from 2009 to 2011.
Corbett played the leading role in two short-lived television series. The first was in the 1997 science fiction series The Visitor, in which Corbett played Adam MacArthur, a man abducted by aliens, only to find his way home 50 years later and endowed with unearthly powers. In 2003, he starred in his second series, Lucky, which was about a professional poker player, Michael "Lucky" Linkletter, living in Las Vegas.
Corbett guest starred on the NBC daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as a hospital administrator for two episodes in late-December 1995 and two episodes in early March 1996. Corbett's film credits include Tombstone, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, Raising Helen, Dreamland and The Messengers. Corbett appeared in Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and he played the role of a music teacher in Raise Your Voice, which starred Hilary Duff. He had a cameo role as Ken Roloff in Dinner Rush (2000). Additionally, Corbett starred in the 2007 Lifetime film Montana Sky, and co-starred as a corrupt LAPD vice squad member in Street Kings (2008). He then starred as Tom Marks, the father of a little girl fighting for her life, in the Hallmark film "November Christmas", which premiered November 28, 2010. Corbett co-starred in the Showtime series United States of Tara opposite Toni Collette.
From 2011 to 2012, he had a recurring role on Parenthood.[13][14] In March 2013, Corbett appeared in two episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles and was considered to be the star of a NCIS spin-off series that was ultimately not produced. He also played teacher Mike Kersjes in the Hallmark film based on the memoir A Smile as Big as the Moon (2012). Corbett provided the voiceover for Applebee's television commercials and, since 2012, for Walgreens' television and radio adverts.[15]
Corbett released a full-length, self-titled country music album, co-produced by D. Scott Miller and Tara Novick, on April 4, 2006, and went on tour that year to promote the album, opening for ZZ Top, Lisa Marie Presley and Charlie Daniels. Its only single, "Good to Go" (which was also recorded by Jason Aldean on his self-titled debut album), debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, which was the highest debut by a new artist from an independent label,[16] and later peaked at No. 43. In addition, Corbett was featured in Trisha Yearwood's music video of her 2008 single "This Is Me You're Talking To". In 2013, Corbett released his second country album, Leaving Nothin' Behind, co-produced by Jon Randall.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Corbett was raised Roman Catholic, but is now a born-again Christian, although he does not attend church.[4] He has never been married, and has stated that he does not see himself getting married or having children.[19] He has been in a relationship with actress Bo Derek since 2002.[20]

Early life[edit]
Corbett was born on May 9, 1961 in Wheeling, West Virginia, the son of Sandy and John Corbett. He grew up in an apartment block near the Ohio River in West Virginia, with his mother, a waitress who worked in his uncle's music club.[2] His mother was of part Russian Jewish descent,[3] though Corbett was raised Catholic.[4] He attended Wheeling Central Catholic High School, where he graduated in 1979.[5] He started playing the guitar at age seven, and at 16 he had a job as a security guard at the Capitol Music Hall.[6] Following his graduation from high school, Corbett moved to California and worked in a steel factory for six years.[7] During his time as a boilermaker in the factory, Corbett spent a year training to become an L.A. County Deputy Sheriff, but ultimately failed.[8] He stopped working at the factory when he got injured, and went to Cerritos College in Norwalk, California. There, he took acting classes and studied hair dressing for a year.[9] Corbett said: "I went to hair school by day and studied theatre at night."[10] He has been a licensed hair stylist since 1986.[11] He then landed a Samsung commercial, and after three years he had starred in 50 national commercials.[12]
Career[edit]




Corbett at the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1992


Corbett's first major role was as the hippie boyfriend of Karen Arnold in season one, episode 4 ("Angel"), of The Wonder Years in 1988. For this appearance, he was credited as Jack Corbett. He has co-starred in three successful television series to date: Northern Exposure from 1990 to 1995, Sex and the City from 2001 to 2002, and United States of Tara from 2009 to 2011.
Corbett played the leading role in two short-lived television series. The first was in the 1997 science fiction series The Visitor, in which Corbett played Adam MacArthur, a man abducted by aliens, only to find his way home 50 years later and endowed with unearthly powers. In 2003, he starred in his second series, Lucky, which was about a professional poker player, Michael "Lucky" Linkletter, living in Las Vegas.
Corbett guest starred on the NBC daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as a hospital administrator for two episodes in late-December 1995 and two episodes in early March 1996. Corbett's film credits include Tombstone, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, Raising Helen, Dreamland and The Messengers. Corbett appeared in Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and he played the role of a music teacher in Raise Your Voice, which starred Hilary Duff. He had a cameo role as Ken Roloff in Dinner Rush (2000). Additionally, Corbett starred in the 2007 Lifetime film Montana Sky, and co-starred as a corrupt LAPD vice squad member in Street Kings (2008). He then starred as Tom Marks, the father of a little girl fighting for her life, in the Hallmark film "November Christmas", which premiered November 28, 2010. Corbett co-starred in the Showtime series United States of Tara opposite Toni Collette.
From 2011 to 2012, he had a recurring role on Parenthood.[13][14] In March 2013, Corbett appeared in two episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles and was considered to be the star of a NCIS spin-off series that was ultimately not produced. He also played teacher Mike Kersjes in the Hallmark film based on the memoir A Smile as Big as the Moon (2012). Corbett provided the voiceover for Applebee's television commercials and, since 2012, for Walgreens' television and radio adverts.[15]
Corbett released a full-length, self-titled country music album, co-produced by D. Scott Miller and Tara Novick, on April 4, 2006, and went on tour that year to promote the album, opening for ZZ Top, Lisa Marie Presley and Charlie Daniels. Its only single, "Good to Go" (which was also recorded by Jason Aldean on his self-titled debut album), debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, which was the highest debut by a new artist from an independent label,[16] and later peaked at No. 43. In addition, Corbett was featured in Trisha Yearwood's music video of her 2008 single "This Is Me You're Talking To". In 2013, Corbett released his second country album, Leaving Nothin' Behind, co-produced by Jon Randall.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Corbett was raised Roman Catholic, but is now a born-again Christian, although he does not attend church.[4] He has never been married, and has stated that he does not see himself getting married or having children.[19] He has been in a relationship with actress Bo Derek since 2002.[20]

Career[edit]




Corbett at the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1992


Corbett's first major role was as the hippie boyfriend of Karen Arnold in season one, episode 4 ("Angel"), of The Wonder Years in 1988. For this appearance, he was credited as Jack Corbett. He has co-starred in three successful television series to date: Northern Exposure from 1990 to 1995, Sex and the City from 2001 to 2002, and United States of Tara from 2009 to 2011.
Corbett played the leading role in two short-lived television series. The first was in the 1997 science fiction series The Visitor, in which Corbett played Adam MacArthur, a man abducted by aliens, only to find his way home 50 years later and endowed with unearthly powers. In 2003, he starred in his second series, Lucky, which was about a professional poker player, Michael "Lucky" Linkletter, living in Las Vegas.
Corbett guest starred on the NBC daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as a hospital administrator for two episodes in late-December 1995 and two episodes in early March 1996. Corbett's film credits include Tombstone, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, Raising Helen, Dreamland and The Messengers. Corbett appeared in Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and he played the role of a music teacher in Raise Your Voice, which starred Hilary Duff.

He then starred as Tom Marks, the father of a little girl fighting for her life, in the Hallmark film "November Christmas", which premiered November 28, 2010. Corbett co-starred in the Showtime series United States of Tara opposite Toni Collette.
From 2011 to 2012, he had a recurring role on Parenthood.[13][14] In March 2013, Corbett appeared in two episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles and was considered to be the star of a NCIS spin-off series that was ultimately not produced. He also played teacher Mike Kersjes in the Hallmark film based on the memoir A Smile as Big as the Moon (2012). Corbett provided the voiceover for Applebee's television commercials and, since 2012, for Walgreens' television and radio adverts.[15]
Corbett released a full-length, self-titled country music album, co-produced by D. Scott Miller and Tara Novick, on April 4, 2006, and went on tour that year to promote the album, opening for ZZ Top, Lisa Marie Presley and Charlie Daniels. Its only single, "Good to Go" (which was also recorded by Jason Aldean on his self-titled debut album), debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, which was the highest debut by a new artist from an independent label,[16] and later peaked at No. 43.

Early life[edit]
Corbett was born on May 9, 1961 in Wheeling, West Virginia, the son of Sandy and John Corbett. He grew up in an apartment block near the Ohio River in West Virginia, with his mother, a waitress who worked in his uncle's music club.[2] His mother was of part Russian Jewish descent,[3] though Corbett was raised Catholic.[4] He attended Wheeling Central Catholic High School, where he graduated in 1979.[5] He started playing the guitar at age seven, and at 16 he had a job as a security guard at the Capitol Music Hall.[6] Following his graduation from high school, Corbett moved to California and worked in a steel factory for six years.[7] During his time as a boilermaker in the factory, Corbett spent a year training to become an L.A. County Deputy Sheriff, but ultimately failed.[8] He stopped working at the factory when he got injured, and went to Cerritos College in Norwalk, California. There, he took acting classes and studied hair dressing for a year.[9] Corbett said: "I went to hair school by day and studied theatre at night."[10] He has been a licensed hair stylist since 1986.[11] He then landed a Samsung commercial, and after three years he had starred in 50 national commercials.[12]
Career[edit]




Corbett at the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1992


Corbett's first major role was as the hippie boyfriend of Karen Arnold in season one, episode 4 ("Angel"), of The Wonder Years in 1988. For this appearance, he was credited as Jack Corbett. He has co-starred in three successful television series to date: Northern Exposure from 1990 to 1995, Sex and the City from 2001 to 2002, and United States of Tara from 2009 to 2011.
Corbett played the leading role in two short-lived television series. The first was in the 1997 science fiction series The Visitor, in which Corbett played Adam MacArthur, a man abducted by aliens, only to find his way home 50 years later and endowed with unearthly powers. In 2003, he starred in his second series, Lucky, which was about a professional poker player, Michael "Lucky" Linkletter, living in Las Vegas.
Corbett guest starred on the NBC daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as a hospital administrator for two episodes in late-December 1995 and two episodes in early March 1996. Corbett's film credits include Tombstone, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, Raising Helen, Dreamland and The Messengers. Corbett appeared in Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and he played the role of a music teacher in Raise Your Voice, which starred Hilary Duff. He had a cameo role as Ken Roloff in Dinner Rush (2000). Additionally, Corbett starred in the 2007 Lifetime film Montana Sky, and co-starred as a corrupt LAPD vice squad member in Street Kings (2008). He then starred as Tom Marks, the father of a little girl fighting for her life, in the Hallmark film "November Christmas", which premiered November 28, 2010. Corbett co-starred in the Showtime series United States of Tara opposite Toni Collette.
From 2011 to 2012, he had a recurring role on Parenthood.[13][14] In March 2013, Corbett appeared in two episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles and was considered to be the star of a NCIS spin-off series that was ultimately not produced. He also played teacher Mike Kersjes in the Hallmark film based on the memoir A Smile as Big as the Moon (2012). Corbett provided the voiceover for Applebee's television commercials and, since 2012, for Walgreens' television and radio adverts.[15]
Corbett released a full-length, self-titled country music album, co-produced by D. Scott Miller and Tara Novick, on April 4, 2006, and went on tour that year to promote the album, opening for ZZ Top, Lisa Marie Presley and Charlie Daniels. Its only single, "Good to Go" (which was also recorded by Jason Aldean on his self-titled debut album), debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, which was the highest debut by a new artist from an independent label,[16] and later peaked at No. 43. In addition, Corbett was featured in Trisha Yearwood's music video of her 2008 single "This Is Me You're Talking To". In 2013, Corbett released his second country album, Leaving Nothin' Behind, co-produced by Jon Randall.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Corbett was raised Roman Catholic, but is now a born-again Christian, although he does not attend church.[4] He has never been married, and has stated that he does not see himself getting married or having children.[19] He has been in a relationship with actress Bo Derek since 2002.[20]

Corbett at the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1992


Corbett's first major role was as the hippie boyfriend of Karen Arnold in season one, episode 4 ("Angel"), of The Wonder Years in 1988. For this appearance, he was credited as Jack Corbett. He has co-starred in three successful television series to date: Northern Exposure from 1990 to 1995, Sex and the City from 2001 to 2002, and United States of Tara from 2009 to 2011.
Corbett played the leading role in two short-lived television series.

Early life[edit]
Corbett was born on May 9, 1961 in Wheeling, West Virginia, the son of Sandy and John Corbett. He grew up in an apartment block near the Ohio River in West Virginia, with his mother, a waitress who worked in his uncle's music club.[2] His mother was of part Russian Jewish descent,[3] though Corbett was raised Catholic.[4] He attended Wheeling Central Catholic High School, where he graduated in 1979.[5] He started playing the guitar at age seven, and at 16 he had a job as a security guard at the Capitol Music Hall.[6] Following his graduation from high school, Corbett moved to California and worked in a steel factory for six years.[7] During his time as a boilermaker in the factory, Corbett spent a year training to become an L.A. County Deputy Sheriff, but ultimately failed.[8] He stopped working at the factory when he got injured, and went to Cerritos College in Norwalk, California. There, he took acting classes and studied hair dressing for a year.[9] Corbett said: "I went to hair school by day and studied theatre at night."[10] He has been a licensed hair stylist since 1986.[11] He then landed a Samsung commercial, and after three years he had starred in 50 national commercials.[12]
Career[edit]




Corbett at the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1992


Corbett's first major role was as the hippie boyfriend of Karen Arnold in season one, episode 4 ("Angel"), of The Wonder Years in 1988. For this appearance, he was credited as Jack Corbett. He has co-starred in three successful television series to date: Northern Exposure from 1990 to 1995, Sex and the City from 2001 to 2002, and United States of Tara from 2009 to 2011.
Corbett played the leading role in two short-lived television series. The first was in the 1997 science fiction series The Visitor, in which Corbett played Adam MacArthur, a man abducted by aliens, only to find his way home 50 years later and endowed with unearthly powers. In 2003, he starred in his second series, Lucky, which was about a professional poker player, Michael "Lucky" Linkletter, living in Las Vegas.
Corbett guest starred on the NBC daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as a hospital administrator for two episodes in late-December 1995 and two episodes in early March 1996. Corbett's film credits include Tombstone, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, Raising Helen, Dreamland and The Messengers. Corbett appeared in Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and he played the role of a music teacher in Raise Your Voice, which starred Hilary Duff. He had a cameo role as Ken Roloff in Dinner Rush (2000). Additionally, Corbett starred in the 2007 Lifetime film Montana Sky, and co-starred as a corrupt LAPD vice squad member in Street Kings (2008). He then starred as Tom Marks, the father of a little girl fighting for her life, in the Hallmark film "November Christmas", which premiered November 28, 2010. Corbett co-starred in the Showtime series United States of Tara opposite Toni Collette.
From 2011 to 2012, he had a recurring role on Parenthood.[13][14] In March 2013, Corbett appeared in two episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles and was considered to be the star of a NCIS spin-off series that was ultimately not produced. He also played teacher Mike Kersjes in the Hallmark film based on the memoir A Smile as Big as the Moon (2012). Corbett provided the voiceover for Applebee's television commercials and, since 2012, for Walgreens' television and radio adverts.[15]
Corbett released a full-length, self-titled country music album, co-produced by D. Scott Miller and Tara Novick, on April 4, 2006, and went on tour that year to promote the album, opening for ZZ Top, Lisa Marie Presley and Charlie Daniels. Its only single, "Good to Go" (which was also recorded by Jason Aldean on his self-titled debut album), debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, which was the highest debut by a new artist from an independent label,[16] and later peaked at No. 43. In addition, Corbett was featured in Trisha Yearwood's music video of her 2008 single "This Is Me You're Talking To". In 2013, Corbett released his second country album, Leaving Nothin' Behind, co-produced by Jon Randall.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Corbett was raised Roman Catholic, but is now a born-again Christian, although he does not attend church.[4] He has never been married, and has stated that he does not see himself getting married or having children.[19] He has been in a relationship with actress Bo Derek since 2002.[20]

11 Actors You Might Not Realize Do Commercial Voiceovers



BY Kate Erbland November 11, 2013









Getty Images













Nowadays, it’s easier than ever to skip over all those pesky (and loud!) television commercials during your favorite programs, but that hasn’t stopped some of the country’s biggest corporations and organizations from pulling out the big guns when it comes to voiceover talent. Consider it a nifty little trick to capture your interest and attention—after all, what better way to keep your finger off the remote than the nagging sense that you’ll be able to figure out who is squawking at you to buy a truck or a hamburger or some investment product if only you could listen just a bit longer? 
So which famous actors and actresses have stepped up to the mic to record words on fancy cars, cozy restaurants, and even toilet paper? You might be surprised.
1. John Cusack – Chevrolet

Cusack came on board as the car company’s main (voice) man back in February, when he replaced another actor, Tim Allen, as the voice o’ Chevy. The Say Anything actor might not be the obvious choice to pontificate on “a man and his truck and also a little calf and rain and the outdoors and a broken fence,” but goshdangit, Cusack lends some serious gravitas to a strangely emotional 30-second spot. Will that little lost calf be okay? If Cusack is narrating it, it looks like we’re in the clear.
2. Jon Hamm – Mercedes Benz

The only surprising thing about actor Jon Hamm giving voice to the luxury lifestyle of Mercedes Benz is that more high profile brands haven’t begged him to do the same thing. Sure, he’s got the smooth and sexy tones of the finest voiceover talents, but he also comes with the added weight of his Mad Men tenure. If a guy who makes his car-purchasing dollars by starring on a show about the finest advertising that money can buy is willing to stump for your product, that’s one heck of an endorsement. The best or nothing indeed.  
3. Jason Sudeikis – Applebee’s

Applebee’s may style itself as your friendly neighborhood restaurant (so friendly and neighborhood-y that you can find the exact same joint in other towns around the country!), but that doesn’t mean they skimp on voiceover talent used to tout their affordable fare. Former SNL funnyman Jason Sudeikis may be the current voice of Applebee’s (and his sardonic attitude really works for sandwich-selling, strange as that may seem), but the restaurant chain has used plenty of other high profile talent in the past, including both John Corbett and Wanda Sykes.
4. Morgan Freeman – Visa

Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman may be best known for his “voice of God” roles on the big screen, but he’s also used his voice talents for a handful of ads for Visa and the NFL. The velvet-voiced thespian might sound like an odd choice for the spunky commercials, but he still manages to add sophistication and pep to otherwise raucous and relatively straightforward ads.
5. Matt Damon – TD Ameritrade

Online broker TD Ameritrade has been going for whimsy in their latest set of ads, and an upbeat Matt Damon is on hand (on voice?) to add a warm familiarity to the commercials. He might not be instantly recognizable, but once you know it’s the Good Will Hunting star, it’s impossible not to hear his slight Boston lilt in every commercial. Why no one has thought to dispatch Damon for a series of Apple commercials, we’ll never know.
6. John Corbett – Walgreens

While he may be best remembered to a certain subset of Sex and the City fans as the dude Carrie Bradshaw should have ended up with, John Corbett has spent his post-SATC years carving out a hearty voiceover career. The former voice of Applebee’s is now the voice of another major chain, Walgreens. Similar to his work for Applebee’s, everyman Corbett is tasked with making Walgreens seem neighborhood-y and friendly—in his world, it’s located at “the corner of happy and healthy.”
7. Lisa Kudrow – Yoplait

Jamie Lee Curtis may be the face of Dannon’s Activia yogurt, but former Friend Lisa Kudrow gives her a real run for her probiotics as the voice of Yoplait. Kudrow’s yogurt ads are zippy, fun, and fresh—not something people usually associate with boring old yogurt. The familiarity of Kudrow’s upbeat voice keeps things moving along and, oops!, now you’ve bought, just like, a lot of yogurt.
8. Antonio Banderas – Nasonex

It’s one of the weirdest continuing commercials on the tube today—a crudely animated series of ads that feature Antonio Banderas and his sexy accent as the voice of a bee who is shilling for allergy medicine. Nasonex’s ads are almost too weird to work, and yet they appear to, simply thanks to the unshakeable recognizability of their bee-voice. Banderas? More like Beederas.
9. Zach Braff – Cottonelle

Actor/writer/director/Grammy winner (true fact!) Zach Braff has frequently thrown his talents into the commercial ring, giving voice to such products as Pur water filters and Wendy’s fast food, along with his continuing gig as the voice of a puppy in Cottonelle’s toilet paper ads. Like Banderas, Braff’s commercial voiceover isn’t confined to simple narration; he’s also tasked with embodying a strange, seemingly unrelated animal mascot. At least the puppy is cute?
10. Allison Janney – Kaiser Permanente

We would happily listen to actress Allison Janney’s voice all day, and if that means tuning in for Kaiser Permanente commercials, we’ll do it. Who else could possibly sound so soothing, so knowledgeable, and so appropriately chipper while chattering about something as confusing and upsetting as health care coverage?
11. John Krasinksi – Esurance

Another shockingly perfect pairing? Hollywood’s most adorable doofball and car insurance. Figuring out how to insure your vehicle can be a headache and a half, but when John Krasinski pops up on your television to tout the merits of Esurance, it suddenly seems entirely doable. Krasinski has done ads for a whole mess of products, including Kodak, Ask.com, Puma, Apple TV, and Carnival Cruises. If Krasinski is selling it, we're buying.

                                    The Funniest Town Name in All 50 States

You can send your Christmas wish list to Santa Claus, Indiana, or get a refill in Hot Coffee, Mississippi. Whether honoring its founders, a local landmark, or its reputation for rowdy bar-brawling, the funniest town names in all 50 states show a sense of humor and personality.
1. ALABAMA // SCREAMER
Screamer, an unincorporated community in southeastern Alabama, has a noisy history. According to a local historian, the name may have two origins. In one version of the story, it comes from the fact that 19th century Native Americans used to loudly heckle white train travelers as they passed by what was then a reservation. The "screaming" could have also referred to the din made by local bears, panthers, and wildcats.
2. ALASKA // UNALASKA


Weston Renoud, Flickr // CC BY-NC 2.0 


Don’t let the name fool you; Unalaska is as Alaskan as it comes. With a little more than 4500 residents, Unalaska is the largest city in the Aleutian Islands. Originally, Unangan residents named it Agunalaksh, a word that means "near the peninsula." As Russian fur traders arrived, the spelling morphed into Ounalashka, which eventually became Unalaska.
3. ARIZONA // WHY
Why call a town "Why?" This teeny-tiny community near the U.S.-Mexico border is named after the Y-shaped intersection of two nearby highways. But because of an Arizona law requiring place names have at least three letters, "Y" became the much more existential "Why."
4. ARKANSAS // SMACKOVER
This town of 1800 people in southern Arkansas, at one point one of the nation’s biggest oil producers, was settled by French trappers in the early 19th century. The name Smackover may have come from the French name for the local creek, Chemin Couvert, which means "covered way"—and "sumac couvert" means a covering of sumac trees, a local plant. Alternate theories trace the name back to the legend of oil streaming "smack over the derrick" or a settler jumping "smack over the creek," according to the state’s website.
5. CALIFORNIA // ROUGH AND READY


Isaac Crumm, Wikimedia Commons // Public Domain 


The early residents of Rough and Ready, California, were prepared to get down and dirty for their independence. Named after a mining company with the same moniker, the town—with a current population of about 1581—was the first to secede from the Union and become its own “republic” in 1850 as a protest against mining taxes, prohibition mandates, and laws that weren’t enforced. Though their rebellion was laughably short-lived (the town rejoined the United States three months later), its residents still pay homage to Rough and Ready’s spirited past with a celebration on the last Saturday in June.
6. COLORADO // NO NAME
What started out as a temporary solution has become a point of pride for locals (currently fewer than 200 in number) in No Name, Colorado. According to reports, a government official first marked a newly constructed exit off I-70 with a sign reading “No Name” as a placeholder. By the time officials got around to officially labeling it, “No Name” had the support of the community and it stuck. Visitors can find the spot near the No Name tunnels, No Name Creek, and the No Name hiking trail.
7. CONNECTICUT // HAZARDVILLE
Hazardville, Connecticut, began as a 19th-century industrial village that made gunpowder. Thankfully, that’s not how it got its moniker: The town was named after Colonel Augustus George Hazard, who purchased and expanded the company in 1837.
8. DELAWARE // CORNER KETCH
It’s rumored that Corner Ketch—an unincorporated community in New Castle County, Delaware—got its name from a rough-and-tumble local bar, whose patrons were so quarrelsome that townspeople would warn strangers, "They'll ketch ye at the corner."
9. FLORIDA // TWO EGG
Two Egg, Florida, got its name during the Great Depression. According to local lore, two young boys were so strapped for cash that they paid a local shopkeeper for sugar by giving them two eggs. These make-do business transactions occurred so regularly that patrons began referring to the establishment as a “two egg store.” Eventually, the name caught on with traveling salesmen, who spread it to other towns.
10. GEORGIA // CLIMAX
Founded in the 1880s, the tiny town of Climax, Georgia, got its name from its location: It sits at the highest point on the railroad between Savannah and the Chattahoochee River.
11. HAWAII // VOLCANO


LDELD, Flickr //  CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 


A cozy little burg near Hilo, Volcano is adjacent to several volcano hot spots. (Sorry.) You can walk the dormant Kilauea Iki Trail, the site of a 1959 eruption, and then stop by the Lava Rock Café for a coffee before heading to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
12. IDAHO // SLICKPOO
Near Culdesac, Idaho, sits the multiple-house assembly of Slickpoo, a slice of real estate that may barely qualify as a town but was once a bustling village. Originally the site of a Catholic mission, it was said to have been gifted to the missionaries by landowner Josiah Slickpoo.
13. ILLINOIS // SANDWICH
No, it’s not named after the cold-cut concoction. Originally called Almon after land developer Almon Cage when it was founded in 1855, Sandwich got its name when a train stop liaison named it after his hometown of Sandwich, New Hampshire. It still capitalizes on the connotation, though: The town holds a Sandwich Festival annually.
14. INDIANA // SANTA CLAUS


Doug Kerr,  Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0 


It feels like Christmas every day in Santa Claus, Indiana. But the origin of the name wasn’t quite so festive. As the story goes, the town was first named Santa Fe. In 1896, when the town wanted to secure a post office, postal officials told it to pick another name since Santa Fe was already taken. Someone thought Santa Claus was an acceptable alternative, and the post office agreed. To their dismay, children began mailing letters to Santa Claus, Indiana, with regularity.
15. IOWA // WHAT CHEER
A former coal mining town in the southeast of the state, What Cheer was christened Petersburg by Peter Britton, who settled here in the 1850s. But enterprising shop owner Joseph Andrews, who created the town post office, suggested calling it What Cheer, possibly after an old English greeting. Britton protested, but the name stuck. Today What Cheer has about 600 residents—down from a peak of 5000—and hosts a seasonal flea market and musical events at its opera house.
16. KANSAS // GAS
The wags in Gas know what you're thinking. "You just passed Gas." "Gas Kan." "Get Gas!" The jokes write themselves. Gas got its name when, no surprise, natural gas was discovered in the area in 1898. Farmer E.K. Taylor promptly sold 60 acres of his land to industrial interests and subdivided the rest into lots, laying the groundwork for Gas (a.k.a. Gas City). Today it's home to around 600 people.
17. KENTUCKY // BUGTUSSLE


Brian Stansberry, Wikimedia Commons // CC BY 4.0 


The name of this tiny hamlet on the Kentucky-Tennessee border is an homage to, you guessed it, the local bug population. The town’s oldest residents say that when workers helped out during the harvest, they would sleep in barns—on hay that was infested with doodlebugs. Legend has it that the workers stayed so long that the bugs grew big enough to “tussle” for the prime napping spots.
18. LOUISIANA // UNEEDUS
The Lake Superior Piling Company established a settlement of model farms here in the 1920s, bringing prosperity to this corner of rural Louisiana. The company’s owners tweaked their corporate slogan, “you need us,” into the town’s new name—and apparently, the feeling was mutual. Residents allegedly founded another model farm community nearby and dubbed it Weneedu.
19. MAINE // BURNT PORCUPINE
It’s easy to imagine where this island off the coast of Maine got its unusual name—just squint at it. Located near Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park, Burnt Porcupine has nearby sister islands with equally intriguing names: Bald Porcupine, Long Porcupine, and Sheep Porcupine.
20. MARYLAND // BORING
The village of Boring could have avoided all of the jokes if they had just stuck with the town’s original name—Fairview. But there are a lot of other Fairviews in the U.S., so when a post office was established in the village in 1880, the postal service requested a rename. Residents voted to honor their first postmaster, David J. Boring—and he surely thought the recognition was anything but.
21. MASSACHUSETTS // BELCHERTOWN
While we had hoped that Belchertown was named for the aftermath of a particularly tasty meal, the real story is a bit less delicious: It’s named after Jonathan Belcher, a colonial governor of Massachusetts.
22. MICHIGAN // HELL
Yes, there is a Hell on Earth, and it’s 15 miles northwest of Ann Arbor. There are several stories floating around about how this name came to be, but the one the town itself declares official is this: In the 1830s, the town settler, George Reeves, made a deal with local farmers to trade his homemade whiskey for the grain they grew. When the farmer’s wives knew their husbands were off dealing with Reeves, they were known to remark, “He’s gone to hell again.” The name stuck.
23. MINNESOTA // NIMROD


Lorie Shaull, Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0 


It’s a pretty exclusive group of Minnesotans who can lay claim to being an official Nimrod: just 69 at last count. Though the town takes up just one square mile of the Gopher State, it’s got one big claim to fame: It’s the hometown of Dick Stigman, a pro baseball player who pitched for the Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Indians, and Boston Red Sox in the 1960s. As for the name itself, it’s a Biblical reference. In the book of Genesis, Nimrod is described as “a mighty hunter before the Lord” and is credited with overseeing the construction of the Tower of Babel.
24. MISSISSIPPI // HOT COFFEE
Back in the horse-and-carriage days, the spot where the town of Hot Coffee, Mississippi, now sits marked the midpoint between Natchez, Mississippi, and Mobile, Alabama—two popular travel destinations. In the late 1800s an inn was erected and, recognizing a good business opportunity when he saw one, a man named L.N. Davis built a store to replenish the supplies of weary travelers and hung a coffee pot outside, which advertised "the best hot coffee around.” His secret? He used spring water to brew New Orleans beans, then sweetened the drink with molasses drippings. Though the store is no longer there, Davis’s java made enough of an impression to become the town’s namesake.
25. MISSOURI // TIGHTWAD
Most legends surrounding the town’s name tend to trace it to a postmaster who was upset with a cheapskate watermelon farmer who sold a promised melon out from under him for an extra 50-cent profit. But these days, the main draw to this tiny town in central Missouri is its bank—customers from all over the country open accounts here just to be able to send checks with the Tightwad logo on them.
26. MONTANA // PRAY
While it’s true that you’ll likely spend more time staring at the heavens while in Big Sky Country, the town of Pray, Montana, wasn’t named as a religious suggestion. Founded in 1907, it was named for then-state representative Charles Nelson Pray.
27. NEBRASKA // MAGNET


z2amiller, Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0 


After mapping out a town in northeast Nebraska, settler B.E. Smith was tasked with naming it. He wanted an attractive name for the community that would draw visitors across its borders, so he christened it Magnet in 1893. Today the locale is home to about 75 residents.
28. NEVADA // JIGGS
About 30 miles south of Elko, Nevada, sits the small town of Jiggs. In 1918, businessman Albert Hankins owned the local hotel, dance hall, and general store—which basically meant he owned the whole town. Looking for a new name for the place, he took a suggestion from his kids. “Jiggs” was the top hat-wearing, Irish-American protagonist of their favorite comic strip Bringing Up Father. Following the name change, the women’s organization in town dubbed itself Maggie’s Club after the character’s wife.
29. NEW HAMPSHIRE // SANDWICH
The Fourth Earl of Sandwich, John Montague, did more than invent a lunchtime staple. In 1763, he chartered a town between the Lakes Region and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. And just like the edible kind of sandwich, the town of Sandwich was named after him. The earl also lent his title to the nearby Sandwich mountain range and Sandwich dome.
30. NEW JERSEY // LOVELADIES


Lauren Spinelli 


The town of Loveladies, New Jersey, was actually named after a man, not a group of women. Located on Long Beach Island, it got its start as one of the life-saving stations that appeared on the Jersey shore in the 1870s. The station borrowed its name from a nearby island owned by Thomas Lovelady, a local hunter and sportsman. When the community grew into a town it tested out several new titles, including Club House and Long Beach Park. In 1952, the early name of Loveladies became official.
31. NEW MEXICO // CANDY KITCHEN
Sandwiched between Zuni and Navajo reservations in western New Mexico, Candy Kitchen Ranch purportedly got its name when a local moonshine distiller needed a front to hide his illicit operations during Prohibition. To secure the sugar necessary to concoct barrels of hooch, the moonshiner established a confectionery that produced pinion nut candy on the side. Candy Kitchen isn’t the only sweet-toothed locale in this neck of rural New Mexico, either: 85 miles down the dusty trail sits a place called Pie Town!
32. NEW YORK // NEVERSINK
The old town of Neversink is currently sunk under about 175 feet of water. Named for the Neversink River, the longest tributary of the Delaware River, the city of 2000 was one of the unlucky Catskill towns flooded in the 1950s to create reservoirs that would provide water to New York City. Luckily, the town relocated in the 1950s shortly after its old Main Street was sunk for good. Not all neighboring locales were so fortunate, though. The flooding forced locals to give a bittersweet goodbye to the now-underwater town of … Bittersweet.
33. NORTH CAROLINA // WHYNOT


G Davis, Flickr // CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 


Around 1860, residents living in the fertile heart of central North Carolina had no name for their home. But when the United States Post Office planned to put down roots in the area, the townspeople convened to decide on a name. Debate ensued: Why not name it this? Why not name it that? The discussion dragged on until one frustrated local butted in and said, “Why not name the town Why Not and let’s go home?” Ambivalence won the day.
34. NORTH DAKOTA // CANNON BALL
Cannon Ball, North Dakota gets its name not from a battle, but from geological curiosities called concretions. Millions of years ago, sediment naturally cemented around plants or shells in the Peace Garden State and hardened into rock, forming unusually perfect spheres that—you guessed it—resemble cannonballs. While these round rocks dot the local Cannonball River, you can ogle at more if you drive 170 miles west to the northern stretches of Theodore Roosevelt National Park.
35. OHIO // KNOCKEMSTIFF
Though nobody can quite pinpoint when the town of Knockemstiff acquired its odd name, they can at least agree that it certainly earned it. Most of the stories about the area’s early days, before it got its foreboding name, involve bar brawls, moonshine, and other types of delinquency. The most famous origin tale, though, centers on the advice of a preacher. When approached by a woman asking him how to keep her cheating husband home and faithful, the preacher responded simply: “Knock ‘em stiff.” Take that advice however you want. The town received mainstream attention in 2008 when author Donald Ray Pollock, a native of Knockemstiff, published a book of 18 short stories that shine a gritty light on life in this rough Midwestern community.
36. OKLAHOMA // GENE AUTRY
The community formerly known as Berwyn, Oklahoma, took on the name of the famous singing cowboy after the man himself came to town and purchased a 1200-acre ranch that he would turn into the headquarters of his Flying A Ranch Rodeo. A few years after the purchase, Cecil Crosby, the deputy sheriff of Carter County, where Berwyn was located, suggested the town change its name to honor Autry. The town’s 227 residents all signed a petition in favor of the change, with the post office and railroad agreeing to alter their names soon after. On November 16, 1941, the town of Berwyn officially became Gene Autry, Oklahoma. Though Autry sold the Flying A Ranch after World War II, the town that bears his name still recognizes the late cowboy actor with a museum and film festival in his honor.
37. OREGON // ZIGZAG
The unincorporated community of Zigzag, Oregon, is a scenic spot that rests in the middle of Mount Hood National Forest. The community itself is named after the Zigzag River, which drains from the Zigzag Glacier. Though the history of the name is unknown, it might be traced back to Joel Palmer, a pioneer of the Oregon territory, who described the erratic movements needed to descend through a ravine near Mount Hood: “The manner of descending is to turn directly to the right, go zigzag for about one hundred yards, then turn short round, and go zigzag until you come under the place where you started from; then to the right, and so on, until you reach the bottom.” Though it was used to describe one particular ravine, the name stuck, and it eventually morphed into becoming a local community. In addition to a town, river, and glacier, Zigzag also lends its name to a volcanic mountain and canyon.
38. PENNSYLVANIA // INTERCOURSE


Ken Lund, Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0 


The Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, village of Intercourse knows what you’re thinking. “It’s okay, you can giggle!” the village’s website says. “We’re happy with our name. It’s the perfect conversation starter.” Just how did the town come by its unusual moniker, which it adopted in 1814? There are several possibilities. According to one theory, the name came from the fact that the town—which was originally called Cross Keys after a local tavern when it was founded in 1754—was at the intersection of two major roads. Another theory posits that the name is an evolution from “Entercourse” because, at the time, the town was located next to the entrance of a racetrack. The final theory revolves around the original meaning of the word intercourse: “connection or dealings between persons or groups; exchange especially of thoughts or feelings.” The sexual meaning of the word intercourse didn’t come into popular use until the late 18th century. Intercourse isn’t the only Pennsylvania town name likely to delight 12-year-olds: Less than 20 minutes up the road is the town Blue Ball. It was named after an 1850s inn.
39. RHODE ISLAND // WOONSOCKET
The sixth largest city in Rhode Island was historically known as la ville la plus française aux États-Unis, which translates to “the most French city in the United States.” Although during the Depression three-quarters of Woonsocket’s residents were of French-Canadian descent, by the 2000 census, that number had dipped to 46.1 percent. “Woonsocket,” though, does not come from French. Historians agree that the town’s whimsical name is a corruption of a word from a Native American language, but they don’t agree on the language, much less the word, from which it derives.
40. SOUTH CAROLINA // KETCHUPTOWN
This Horry County town got its name from a country store built by Herbert Small in 1927, but not because of the condiments it sold. Every week, farmers would flock to Small’s store to “catch up” on news and gossip. As a town grew up around the store, the name stuck.
41. SOUTH DAKOTA // MUD BUTTE
Mud Butte was named for a nearby barren butte—that is, an isolated hill with steep sides and a flat top. In 1981, archeologists digging around in Mud Butte unearthed the sixth Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton ever discovered, after a local rancher finally got around to calling a museum about the dinosaur bones he’d seen jutting out of a cliff on his property for years.
42. TENNESSEE // DIFFICULT
There are competing theories on the genesis of Difficult’s name. One holds that when town residents applied for a post office, the U.S. Postal Service responded, “your name is difficult,” referring either to its pronunciation, spelling, or the handwriting on the application. Residents took the letter as an order, and accepted the name Difficult. The other theory goes that the town named itself Difficult out of spite after a postal official suggested its name was too hard to pronounce.
43. TEXAS // DING DONG


Oyoyoy, Wikimedia Commons // CC BY-SA 3.0 


Upon learning that the town of Ding Dong is located in Bell County, Texas, you might reasonably conclude that the two facts are related. But you’d be wrong. The community was named after its founders, the Bell family—but they’re unrelated to Governor Peter Hansborough Bell, in whose honor the county was named.
44. UTAH // MEXICAN HAT
Visitors to Mexican Hat, Utah, never have to wonder how the community got its name. The answer is as plain as day: a 60-foot-wide, sombrero-shaped rock formation on the northeast side of town.
45. VERMONT // SATANS KINGDOM
If New England town names are any indication, Satan’s been awfully busy. The prince of darkness evidently has franchises in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Vermont—the latter of which was purportedly named by a resentful settler who "expected fertile, rolling acres and had received rocks and hills instead."
46. VIRGINIA // BUMPASS
It’s pronounced “bump-iss,” the locals will tell you—if they tell you anything at all. Many Bumpass residents have developed a no-talking-to-strangers policy. Maybe they're just tired of being the butt of every joke.
47. WASHINGTON // HUMPTULIPS


SchmuckyTheCat, Wikimedia Commons //  CC BY-SA 3.0 


This tiny town, located about 25 miles north of Aberdeen (famous as Kurt Cobain's birthplace), was once a major logging center. Today it's better known for its unusual name, which comes from a local Native American word meaning "hard to pole." The phrase is a reference to the nearby Humptulips River, which Native Americans used to canoe by propelling themselves along with poles. The unusual-sounding term has brought the area a bit of fame: Humptulips is mentioned in the books Another Popular Roadside Attraction by Tom Robbins and The Long World by Sir Terry Pratchett.
48. WEST VIRGINIA // LICK FORK
While the name of this unincorporated community might whet your appetite, it's likely named for a nearby salt lick, which was probably more appealing to horses and wild animals than humans. There's a Lick Fork creek, road, and more nearby, so there's no shortage of photo opportunities.
49. WISCONSIN // BOSSTOWN
This Richland County, Wisconsin, community reportedly takes its name from William Henry Dosch. Nickname: Boss. According to The Romance of Wisconsin Place Names, Dosch was sick as a boy, and he got so used to the attention he received while ill that he later became rather bossy with his family. Later, he owned a store on the site of an old saw mill.
50. WYOMING // CHUGWATER
It’s Chug-water, not Chug-water. The land that this tiny Wyoming town calls home was once the territory of the Mandan tribe, whose chief was reportedly injured during a buffalo hunt and sent his son to lead the hunting party in his place. According to Chugwater’s website, the son determined that the easiest way to kill the buffalo was to drive them off the local chalk cliffs. “The word ‘chug,’” the town’s website notes, “is said to describe the noise that the buffalo or the falling chalk made when it hit the ground or fell into the water under the bluff, depending on which version of the legend you wish to believe. Indians began to call the area ‘water at the place where the buffalo chug.’” When white settlers came to the area, they used the Native American terminology for the land, dubbing it Chug Springs. A local stream was named Chugwater Creek (after Chug Springs), and that’s where the town gets its name.

These casual, unpretentious spots serve a variety of inexpensive beers, cocktails, and (occasionally) snacks.

Early life[edit]
Corbett was born on May 9, 1961 in Wheeling, West Virginia, the son of Sandy and John Corbett. He grew up in an apartment block near the Ohio River in West Virginia, with his mother, a waitress who worked in his uncle's music club.[2] His mother was of part Russian Jewish descent,[3] though Corbett was raised Catholic.[4] He attended Wheeling Central Catholic High School, where he graduated in 1979.[5] He started playing the guitar at age seven, and at 16 he had a job as a security guard at the Capitol Music Hall.[6] Following his graduation from high school, Corbett moved to California and worked in a steel factory for six years.[7] During his time as a boilermaker in the factory, Corbett spent a year training to become an L.A. County Deputy Sheriff, but ultimately failed.[8] He stopped working at the factory when he got injured, and went to Cerritos College in Norwalk, California. There, he took acting classes and studied hair dressing for a year.[9] Corbett said: "I went to hair school by day and studied theatre at night."[10] He has been a licensed hair stylist since 1986.[11] He then landed a Samsung commercial, and after three years he had starred in 50 national commercials.[12]
Career[edit]




Corbett at the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards in August 1992


Corbett's first major role was as the hippie boyfriend of Karen Arnold in season one, episode 4 ("Angel"), of The Wonder Years in 1988. For this appearance, he was credited as Jack Corbett. He has co-starred in three successful television series to date: Northern Exposure from 1990 to 1995, Sex and the City from 2001 to 2002, and United States of Tara from 2009 to 2011.
Corbett played the leading role in two short-lived television series. The first was in the 1997 science fiction series The Visitor, in which Corbett played Adam MacArthur, a man abducted by aliens, only to find his way home 50 years later and endowed with unearthly powers. In 2003, he starred in his second series, Lucky, which was about a professional poker player, Michael "Lucky" Linkletter, living in Las Vegas.
Corbett guest starred on the NBC daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives as a hospital administrator for two episodes in late-December 1995 and two episodes in early March 1996. Corbett's film credits include Tombstone, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, Raising Helen, Dreamland and The Messengers. Corbett appeared in Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and he played the role of a music teacher in Raise Your Voice, which starred Hilary Duff. He had a cameo role as Ken Roloff in Dinner Rush (2000). Additionally, Corbett starred in the 2007 Lifetime film Montana Sky, and co-starred as a corrupt LAPD vice squad member in Street Kings (2008). He then starred as Tom Marks, the father of a little girl fighting for her life, in the Hallmark film "November Christmas", which premiered November 28, 2010. Corbett co-starred in the Showtime series United States of Tara opposite Toni Collette.
From 2011 to 2012, he had a recurring role on Parenthood.[13][14] In March 2013, Corbett appeared in two episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles and was considered to be the star of a NCIS spin-off series that was ultimately not produced. He also played teacher Mike Kersjes in the Hallmark film based on the memoir A Smile as Big as the Moon (2012). Corbett provided the voiceover for Applebee's television commercials and, since 2012, for Walgreens' television and radio adverts.[15]
Corbett released a full-length, self-titled country music album, co-produced by D. Scott Miller and Tara Novick, on April 4, 2006, and went on tour that year to promote the album, opening for ZZ Top, Lisa Marie Presley and Charlie Daniels. Its only single, "Good to Go" (which was also recorded by Jason Aldean on his self-titled debut album), debuted at No. 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, which was the highest debut by a new artist from an independent label,[16] and later peaked at No. 43. In addition, Corbett was featured in Trisha Yearwood's music video of her 2008 single "This Is Me You're Talking To". In 2013, Corbett released his second country album, Leaving Nothin' Behind, co-produced by Jon Randall.[17][18]
Personal life[edit]
Corbett was raised Roman Catholic, but is now a born-again Christian, although he does not attend church.[4] He has never been married, and has stated that he does not see himself getting married or having children.[19] He has been in a relationship with actress Bo Derek since 2002.[20]

Classically Refined

                                    Anello recreates the traditional style Venetian chandelier by taking handcrafted, Venetian glass and spotlighting it with a light framework. The result is a ring of leaves that seem to float in the air, finished in straw and clear glass to allow the light to filter through.

Pure Radiance

                                    Helios is an intricate sculptural work of art. At its center, scalloped opal glass diffuses the LED light so evenly that it is almost impossible to tell where the source originates from.
                                



                                    Take a closer look 












Check out this Grand Prize-winning installation of Calligraphy in our latest issue of Larger Than Light. Canadian designer Kelly, of Wolseley Studio, gives us the story of how she transformed a home her clients were building for their retirement with impactful lighting.

From the Runway

                                    Innovative patterns and designs spread rapidly, traveling from runway to entryway. Pulse is made from handcrafted iron mesh screens that fold together and finished in gold leaf to create the appearance of motion and a sense of fluidity.

Crystal Remix

                                    Evoking royal glamour and luxury, Tiara is a sumptuous chandelier that pairs classic elements with a unique diamond-patterned crown as its frame. Every opening features a faceted pear crystal within the beautifully designed bronze leaf frame.
