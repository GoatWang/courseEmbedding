Fitch Expects to Rate First National Master Note Trust, Series 2015-1; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate First National Master Note Trust, Series 2015-1; 
      Presale Issued
    





September 10, 2015 12:26 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following rating to the First 
      National Master Note Trust, series 2015-1 credit card asset-backed 
      floating rate notes:
    

      --$250,000,000 class A notes 'AAAsf(EXP)'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch's expected rating is based on the underlying receivables pool; 
      available credit enhancement; First National Bank of Omaha's 
      underwriting and servicing capabilities; and the transaction's legal and 
      cash flow structures, which employ early amortization triggers.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating 
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card 
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a 
      reduction in purchase rate, and 3) a combination stress of higher 
      defaults and lower monthly payment rate (MPR).
    

      Increasing defaults alone has no impact on rating migration even in the 
      most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating 
      sensitivity to a reduction in purchase rate also leads to no impact in 
      rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a 100% reduction in 
      purchase rate. The harshest scenario assumes that an increase in 
      defaults and reduction in monthly payment rate occur simultaneously. In 
      this scenario, the ratings could be downgraded under the severe stress 
      of a 75% increase in defaults and 35% reduction in MPR.
    

      For further discussion of Fitch's sensitivity analysis, please see the 
      related presale report. For a discussion of the representations, 
      warranties, and enforcement mechanisms available to investors in this 
      transaction please see the related presale appendix.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Rates First National Master Note Trust, Series 2015-1
    





September 17, 2015 01:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following rating to the First National Master 
      Note Trust, series 2015-1 credit card asset-backed floating rate class A 
      note:
    

      --$300,000,000 class A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch's rating is based on the underlying receivables pool, available 
      credit enhancement, First National Bank of Omaha's underwriting and 
      servicing capabilities, and the transaction's legal and cash flow 
      structures, which employ early amortization triggers.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating 
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card 
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a 
      reduction in purchase rate, and 3) a combination stress of higher 
      defaults and lower monthly payment rate (MPR).
    

      Increasing defaults alone has no impact on rating migration even in the 
      most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating 
      sensitivity to a reduction in purchase rate also leads to no impact in 
      rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a 100% reduction in 
      purchase rate. The harshest scenario assumes that an increase in 
      defaults and reduction in monthly payment rate occur simultaneously. In 
      this scenario, the rating could be downgraded under the severe stress of 
      a 75% increase in defaults and 35% reduction in MPR.
    

      For further discussion of Fitch's sensitivity analysis, please see the 
      related presale report. For a discussion of the representations, 
      warranties, and enforcement mechanisms available to investors in this 
      transaction please see the related presale appendix.
