	Explanation of Responses:










	(1) 





	The 8.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock") of Accretive Health, Inc. (the "Issuer") is convertible at any time, at the holder's election, and has no expiration date.









	(2) 





	This Form 4 is being filed jointly pursuant to Rule 16a-1(a)(3) and Rule 16a-3(j) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") to report the beneficial ownership of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that TCP-ASC ACHI Series LLLP (the "Partnership"), TCP-ASC GP, LLC (the "Partnership GP"), TI IV ACHI Holdings GP, LLC (the "Aggregator GP"), TI IV ACHI Holdings, LP (the "Aggregator"), TowerBrook Investors Ltd. ("TowerBrook"), Neal Moszkowski, Ramez Sousou, and Ascension Health Alliance d/b/a Ascension ("Ascension") (together, the "Reporting Persons") may be deemed to have acquired as a payment-in-kind dividend on April 3, 2017 under the Certificate of Designations of 8.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designations"), dated as of February 16, 2016.









	(3) 





	The Partnership is a Delaware series limited liability limited partnership that was formed to effect the purchase (the "Purchase") of the Issuer's securities, including 200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in connection with that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 7, 2015, by and among the Issuer, the Partnership and Ascension (the "Purchase Agreement"). The sole general partner of the Partnership is the Partnership GP, and the limited partners of the Partnership are the Aggregator and Ascension. The Partnership GP is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed to effect the Purchase. The members of the Partnership GP are the Aggregator and Ascension. (cont'd)









	(4) 





	(cont'd) The Aggregator is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed to effect the Purchase. The sole general partner of the Aggregator is the Aggregator GP, and the limited partners of the Aggregator are TowerBrook Investors IV (Onshore), L.P., TowerBrook Investors IV (OS), L.P., TowerBrook Investors IV Executive Fund, L.P., TowerBrook Investors IV (892), L.P. and TowerBrook Investors Team Daybreak, L.P. The Aggregator GP is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed to effect the Purchase. The sole member of the Aggregator GP is TowerBrook. TowerBrook is a Cayman Islands corporation and its principal business is to serve as the general partner or member of various affiliates of investment funds managed or advised by TowerBrook Capital Partners L.P. The directors and joint controlling shareholders of TowerBrook are Neal Moszkowski, a U.S. citizen, and Ramez Sousou, a U.K. citizen. Ascension is a Missouri not-for-profit corporation.









	(5) 





	Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, on April 3, 2017, the Partnership received 4,287 shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Issuer as a payment-in-kind dividend for the period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on March 31, 2017 on the 214,363 shares of Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the Partnership since the Purchase closed on February 16, 2016. The reported securities may be deemed to be owned directly by the Partnership, and indirectly by the Partnership GP, the Aggregator GP, the Aggregator, TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski, Ramez Sousou and Ascension. As permitted by Rule 16a-1(a)(4), the filing of this Form 4 shall not be construed as an admission that any of the Reporting Persons are beneficial owners of any of the securities covered by this statement.









	(6) 





	Pursuant to that certain Limited Liability Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership, dated as of December 7, 2015, by and between the Partnership GP, the Aggregator and Ascension (the "Partnership Agreement"), the board of directors of the Partnership established a series of partnership interests to hold the securities allocable to the Aggregator under the Partnership Agreement ("Series TB") and a series of partnership interests to hold the securities allocable to Ascension under the Partnership Agreement ("Series AS"). Accordingly, the Aggregator GP, the Aggregator, TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou disclaim beneficial ownership of the 1,929 shares of Series A Preferred Stock distributed as a payment-in-kind dividend on April 3, 2017 held directly by Series AS, whereas Ascension disclaims beneficial ownership of the 2,358 shares of Series A Preferred Stock distributed as payment-in-kind dividend on April 3, 2017 and held directly by Series TB.










	Remarks:



	For purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be directors by deputization by virtue of their contractual right to appoint directors to the board of directors of the Issuer. As a result, the "Director" box is marked in Item 5 of this Form 4.

We carry everything you need to outfit your business, office, warehouse, parking lot, or home with the lights you need at prices you'll love. Make sure to checkout our Lighting Guide if you're new to selecting light bulbs by color temperature.
Wall Packs
Wall pack lights are an excellent solution for security purposes and parking lots. They are designed with durable features such as shatter-resistant glass to protect each fixture from vandalism and bad weather. 1000Bulbs.com offers a wide selection of wall pack lighting that includes metal halide, high-pressure sodium, compact fluorescent, and LED fixtures.
Flood Fixtures
Flood light fixtures are used for sporting events, parking lots, outdoor events, and more. Our selection includes induction, metal halide, high-pressure sodium, compact fluorescent and LED fixtures, giving you plenty of great options to choose from.
Fluorescent High Bays
Use
fluorescent high bay fixtures to illuminate your business, office, warehouse, or any other commercial or industrial space. Choose from T5 and T8 fixtures with options for 2, 3, 4, or 6 lamps.
LED Troffers
We carry 2x4, 2x2, and 1x4 LED troffers in 3,500K to 5,000K color temperatures. These troffers are great for schools, hospitals and commercial office spaces because they provide clean, even illumination with energy savings.
Suspended Fluorescent Fixtures
Our suspended fluorescent fixtures are suitable for surface or pendant mounting. Available in 2, 3, 4, and 6 lamp options.
Security Lighting
We sell battery-powered and LED security lighting. Our battery-powered systems, quartz bullet flood lights and motion sensors can keep your property safe.
High Bay FixturesHigh bay fixtures are ideal in commercial and industrial spaces. Choose from compact fluorescent, metal halide/pulse-start, and LED fixtures that are temporary, non-ballasted, or made from spun aluminum.
Fluorescent Strip FixturesFluorescent strip fixtures are suitable for general or task lighting and are easily mounted to the wall or ceiling. Available in 1 to 4 lamp fixtures.
Vapor Tight Fluorescent FixturesVapor tight fluorescent fixtures are long, strip fixtures that provide a wide range of light and energy savings.
Vapor Proof LightingVapor proof lighting is suitable for use in wet locations, so industrial style outdoor lighting is a possibility. Its clear heat resistant tempered glass is vapor proof.
Canopy FixturesCanopy fixtures are great for underpasses, loading docks and parking garages, as well as wet locations or where vandal-resistant lighting is required. We carry metal halide/pulse start, compact fluorescent, canopy lights.
Bulk HeadsBulk head fixtures are common in schools, hospitals, and a variety of other commercial and industrial spaces. Choose from oval, circle, caged, or hooded fixtures.
Temporary Lighting
Sometimes, temporary lighting is needed for the duration of a project or special event. 1000Bulbs.com covers this need with temporary caged light stringers, sockets, lamp guards, and dock lights.
Under Cabinet LightsUnder cabinet lights aren't just for the kitchen anymore. They are becoming more commonly used to light desks, office spaces, coves and shelves as well. We carry LED, xenon, and fluorescent options.
Track LightingTrack lighting constitutes fixtures where a series of lights, each mounted onto an adjustable "head," are installed on a single overhead track. We offer both low and line voltage track lighting system and accessories.
Recessed LightingRecessed lighting constitutes fixtures in which the majority of the light fixture is mounted inside the ceiling, leaving only the bulb, trim and/or lens exposed. Recessed lights typically have three parts: the housing, bulb, and trim (and sometimes a lens). We carry LED, CFL, incandescent, and halogen recessed lights and accessories.
LED WraparoundLED wraparound fixtures are similar to fluorescent troffers, only surface-mounted, thinner, and they do not require separate bulbs. They are ideal for utility lighting in parking garages and stairwells.
]LED Shop LightsLED shop lights are a perfect addition to any industrial workspace or shop area. They can be turned on by pulling a chain included within the fixture.

Lighting that saves you money. Our energy-saving compact fluorescents and LED bulbs can drastically reduce your energy costs and help protect the environment.

Selecting the Right Bulb
Incandescent
Incandescent bulbs, which provide most home lighting, are used in products from nightlights to floodlights. The most common incandescent is a pear-shaped (A19) bulb with a medium-sized screw-type base. Incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot, producing light. About 90 percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat. This style typically burns for 750 to 10,000 hours.
Halogen
Halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with Halogen gas, which emits a bright white light. Long life and full spectrum Halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage. The life of these bulbs is around 2,000 to 10,000 hours or two to five years.
Linear Fluorescent
Linear fluorescent bulbs, also known as fluorescent tubes, are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they don't produce much heat. These are the thin, long tube lights often found in kitchens for under-cabinet lighting, or in garages, workshops, and basements. The tubes can last from 10,000 to 44,000 hours—10 to 40 times longer than incandescent lights. Fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts.
Compact Fluorescent
Compact fluorescents, also known as CFLs, provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just one-fourth of the energy. For example, a 15-watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Compact fluorescent bulbs last about 10,000 hours—10 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
High Intensity Discharge
High intensity discharge, or HID, bulbs include metal halide, high pressure sodium, and mercury vapor lights. As their name implies, HID bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power. They are a mainstay of parking lot, street, and warehouse lighting. Like fluorescent bulbs, HID bulbs also require a ballast.
Stage and Studio
Stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized, high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio. Traditionally, these bulbs have used Halogen or HID technology, though LED stage lights are becoming more common.
Miniature Indicator
Miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels. Though we carry hundreds of miniature bulbs, you can find the replacement you need by identifying the numeric code stamped on the base of your old bulb.
Automotive
Automotive bulbs include everything from Halogen headlight capsules to the tiny incandescent bulbs that go in makeup mirrors and everything in between. No matter the make or model of your car, we have the bulb that fits.

Georgia-Pacific Products Overview



Today’s Georgia-Pacific is vastly different from the small lumberyard that salesman Owen Cheatham started at Augusta, Ga., in 1927.  Using $6,000 of his own money and $6,000 from investors, Cheatham purchased an existing lumberyard consisting of storage sheds and a small business office and created Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company.  The company survived the Great Depression, and ultimately became a top supplier to the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II.
Georgia-Pacific, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, is headquartered in Atlanta and employs approximately 35,000 people at more than 200 facilities worldwide.

Benefits of LED Lighting
LED light bulbs can save you money not only because they are roughly 80% more energy efficient than other bulbs, they also produce far less heat than metal halides, CFLs, and incandescent light bulbs. Upgrading to LED lighting means you won’t spend your summer months cooling down rooms that your light bulbs are busy heating up. While originally a cooler blue tone than incandescent bulbs, LEDs now come in daylight and warm white color temperatures so you can more easily replace your existing bulbs without altering the color of your room. Visit our Lighting Guide to see what difference color temperature makes. LED lighting also offers a superior color rendering index (CRI), so you can see the colors of your artwork or makeup more accurately.
LED replacement bulbs are durable and ecologically friendly. Did you know you can recycle LED bulbs and reduce your carbon footprint up to one third? LEDs outlast the competition, staying bright for up to 11 years of continuous operation. This means less time climbing ladders trying to replace those hard to reach bulbs in vaulted ceilings. 
 LEDs are one of today’s most promising technologies.

No mercury, making them a cleaner alternative to fluorescent and CFL lamps.
The lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date.
Light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products.
Life that is 20 times than some traditional lighting products.



LEDs or Fluorescents - Which is More Efficient?


LED light bulbs for the win! When it comes to purchasing energy-efficient lighting, LEDs surpass CFLs by a wide margin. LEDs are instant-start with no warmup time needed. They work well in cold weather, and are substantially more durable since manufactured out of plastic instead of glass. From standard bulbs to fluorescent tubes, LEDs can replicate the same lighting conditions found in fluorescents while lasting longer and using less energy. As an added bonus, all LEDs are RoHS compliant and do not use mercury, a claim that can't be made by fluorescent bulbs.

LED Lighting Options




Standard Shape A19
 - Designed to give the appearance and pattern of a standard incandescent bulb. Standard and A-shape LED bulbs fit the same sockets and fixtures as your current household lights.



3-Way LED
 - A three-way bulb is a light bulb that has two brightness settings instead of the standard on or off. If your lamp or fixture says it requires a three-way bulb, this is the category for you.



Vintage LED Bulbs
- Vintage reproduction bulbs are now available with LED filament. They have a warm orange glow with lower light levels to mimic the style of a vintage bulb on a dimmer as it transitions from yellow to orange. These
Edison style and
Victorian style bulbs make great collector items. Order yours today to make your own steampunk lighting.



Wet Location LED Bulbs
 - A wet location UL rating means these LED light bulbs can be used in humid indoor areas or outdoors where water may drop or flow against the bulb or fixture.



Decorative LED Bulbs
 - Browse
LED globe lights ranging from 3 in. to 1.5 in. diameters or find LED replacement bulbs for your
chandelier light bulbs. The long life of LEDs mean less time on the ladder changing burnt out bulbs. Many LED chandelier lights are dimmer switch compatible and come in a range of color temperature so you can still enjoy the ambiance of traditional bulbs but the energy savings of LEDs.



LED Tubes
 - LED tubes are the emerging standard for commercial and household lighting. Ranging in size from T5 to T12 and a variety of color temperatures, these LED tubes are an easy way to upgrade to energy efficient lighting. Some of them work with or without an existing ballast, making the transition to LED lighting easier than ever. These LED tubes emit the same amount of light as fluorescent T8s, while using a fraction of the power and lasting up to three times longer. LED tubes are especially effective in cold areas like refrigeration lockers where fluorescent tubes are less efficient at producing light.



LED Tape Lights
 - For accents, alcove, and backlighting, LED tape light is a fantastic choice. More flexible than rope light and bright enough for accent illumination, a strip of LED tape light can bring any place to life. There are countless uses and applications for this easily installed new light source.



Shatter Resistant LED Bulbs
 - Dipped in a special coating, these bulbs may still break if dropped, but they won’t shatter into pieces and fly across your floor. We recommend not dropping them, but if you do, these make cleanup quite a bit easier.



LED Night Lights
 - Keep the monsters away with LED night lights. Motion activated, and battery powered, these LED bulbs will light the way to the bathroom or give reassurance that nothing is lurking under the bed when your child needs to reach for a dropped retainer or teddy bear. Mounted using tape or screws, light only the area you need without waking sleeping babies.



Reflectors
 - From the powerful flood and spot lights, to home bound recessed or track lights, reflectors find excellent use indoors or out. LED reflector lamps can provide the same brilliance for less energy and will create far less heat than an incandescent or halogen lamp. As a bonus, they have a higher CRI than fluorescent reflectors for better colors.


Shop by Brand - Shop top brands for LED light bulbs including
Cree and
Soraa. Watch installation videos for help retrofitting an existing structure or give us a call to talk to a licensed electrician.



Things to Consider When Buying LED Lighting




Equivalent Wattage - While lumens are the new standard, it helps to have an easily recognizable guide. Comparing an LED bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room. As a very ballpark figure for LED wattages, 1/4 or 1/5 the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need.


Lumens - Lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total. On average, a 60-watt incandescent shines at 800 lumens, with roughly 50-100 lumens of difference above or below. The variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp. LEDs are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb.


Color Temperature - Your guide to how the light itself will look. Lower values are warmer, with 2700-3000K being a more incandescent "warm white" while higher temperatures like 5000K will deliver a very harsh "stark white" light. Our  Lighting Guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen.
        

Driver Content - Because of their design, LEDs do not typically run on AC voltage.  Many LEDs require some form of 
            driver to convert the voltage from AC to DC for proper operation.  The majority of socket-based LED lamps are self-driven, but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an LED and a 
            driver
             at the same time if it isn't self-driven.
