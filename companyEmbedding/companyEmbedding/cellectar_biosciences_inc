Cellectar Biosciences: Hype Versus Science - Cellectar Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLRB) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Cellectar Biosciences: Hype Versus ScienceMay.23.16 | About: Cellectar Biosciences, (CLRB) Aaron Faulkner Long/short equity, contrarian, tech, internetFree Market Millenial  SummaryOn Friday, CLRB rose over 200% on news that its phospholipid ether analogs as cancer-targeting drug vehicles had received their US Patent and Trademark numbers.Despite only recently becoming Nasdaq compliant, CLRB saw over 45M shares frantically traded during the rally. Speculators are investing on the hopes the company can maintain stockholders' equity.With three analogs in clinical trials, the company may be building a profitable business around their technology. Unlike some of you, I am not an expert in the vast knowledge repository of information that is needed to make snap decisions regarding the latest news. Emotions can kick in when we feel threatened by uncertainty and that can lead to rash decisions. When that happens some of us tend to buy or sell a stock with logical reasoning behind our sentiment but show an irrational reasoning for our trade. Like, when a promising biotech company with three product candidates in various phases of clinical trials happens to announce a bit of preemptive good news. Because I feel that the type of poor discipline that leads day-traders to losses is better met with due diligence when making a long-term decision, here is my take away on Cellectar Biosciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:CLRB) Cellectar is developing a portfolio of product candidates that are built on a cancer cell-targeting delivery and retention platform. At the foundation of this technology is a single chemical core structure, CLR1404. This compound works as a scaffolding for other therapeutic and diagnostic agents to be attached. Establishing xenograft tumor models from the patient's own tumor tissue is thought to preserve the original tumors attributes. Based on this accepted theory, xenografts are used to offer researchers relevant data into clinical outcomes when analyzing the efficacy of different cancer therapies. Radioiodinated CLR1404 has been evaluated in over 60 xenograft and spontaneous (transgenic) tumor models. Cellectar's scientist have developed phospholipid ether analogs as a cancer-targeting drug vehicle. The delivery system can potentially find cancer cells and stop them from metabolizing while leaving non-malignant cells alone. The company claims that their platform is both "scalable and compelling" due to the wide spectrum of product candidates and their potential application. While in clinical trials, the company is attempting to demonstrate the proof-of-concept behind its three alkyl phosphocholine analogs. 

*source:Phospholipid ether analogs for the detection of colorectal tumors The delivery system takes advantage of a unique characteristic of cell membranes' phospholipid bilayer-enriched "lipid rafts". These lipid rafts are thought to serve as the doorway through the cholesterol-rich cell walls. Solid tumors can contain an over-abundance of phospholipid-ethers relative to normal cells. CLRB is attempting to capitalize on the differences between phospholipid levels between cancerous cells and their healthy counterparts. CLR 1502: Research has demonstrated "the practical and promising" potential of this analog for applications in fluorescence-guided tumor surgery. CLR 124: A diagnostic PET imaging agent. Currently in Phase 2 of an open-label, imaging trial for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. CLR 131: A molecular radiotherapeutic agent which has shown significant tumor growth reduction and survival benefit from a single injection in a wide range of human tumor xenograft models. The phase I clinical trial has revealed images that demonstrate the effectiveness of 131I-CLR1404 between 6 and 21 days after administration. The areas of increased signal intensity shown in the image correspond to previously known areas of metastatic colon cancer in both lungs. 

 Guide: T = tumor; H=heart I-131-CLR1404 demonstrated that during its phase 1 clinical trial that the compound could be targeted against Multiple myeloma. MM is an incurable, monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells that affects 80,000 Americans. Each year 22,000 new cases of MM are diagnosed. Additionally, 11,000 deaths are attributed to this condition annually. Cellectar's analogs may be able to provide for an unmet need. Relapsed disease such as MM presents the speculative investor an opportunity for growth through Cellectar's pipeline. Is This Company Worth Investing In Yet?     Annual   Quarterly               2015-12 2014-12 2013-12   2016-03 2015-03  Income Statement  Revenue - - -   - -   Operating Income -9 -10 -12   -2 -3   Net Income -5 -8 -11   1 -2   Earnings Per Share -7.03 -17.70 -38.00   0.91 -3.00   Diluted Average Shares 1 0 0   1 1  Balance Sheet  Current Assets 4 10 3   2 7   Non Current Assets 3 4 4   3 4   Total Assets 8 13 7   6 11   Current Liabilities 6 2 5   3 6   Total Liabilities 6 3 5   3 6   Stockholders' Equity 2 11 2   3 5  Cash Flow  Cash From Operations -8 -9 -9   -2 -2   Capital Expenditures 0 0 0   - 0   Free Cash Flow -8 -9 -9   -2 -2  In millions except "EPS". Currency in USD.  Data Source One false flag attracting investors is the company's positive EPS in Q1 2016. This was due to the restructuring of previously underwritten warrants and their treatment as derivatives. For Q1 2016 the company reported a gain on derivative warrants of ~$2,825,000 compared to a gain of ~$288,000 reported in Q1 2015. These amounts represent the change in fair value, outstanding warrants which are classified as liabilities because they contain a "down-round" anti-dilution provisions. I believe uninformed investors may have a false impression that the fundamentals are solid when in reality the company is desperate for working capital. We estimate that our available cash and cash equivalents should fund the company's planned operations into the first quarter of 2017. Additional capital will be required to complete our planned clinical and preclinical development. -Q1 '16 Earnings Call Transcript 

CLRB data by YCharts CLRB's market cap declined from $23.5 million in 2014 to $6.3 million in 2015. To complicate things further, the volatility in the shares makes for evaluating this company a nightmare. No guarantees have been given in regards to the patents. In my opinion, I do not feel that the preliminary news release of the company's expected patent award to justify a position. I also believe that CLRB is rallying on the claims that there will be more announcements regarding Cellectar's R&D. Until securing the capital needed for 2017, it is unclear if the pre-clinical and clinical development of the analogs will continue. Although this volatility may not be a bad sign for short-term traders looking to scalp a profit, it does make timing a long position a gamble. I would stay away from this stock until the company has actually been issued its patents. If at that point the company has stabilized its financial position a long entry may be justified. In terms of supporting the rally to $3.45, the technology just isn't there yet. My advice: beware of what comes next but be prepared to act. I do believe now is the time to pay attention to CLRB because the earnings potential in the pipeline. As of now, CLRB only has one of its three analogs that is in phase II clinical trials. It will not be until the end of Phase III that the company may see potential revenue. Ideally, my long position would be initiated after a pullback from this current rally. Shares purchased between $1.00 and $1.50 could serve as a value based core position for long-term growth if the company can continue to stay compliant with Nasdaq by keeping the shares above $1.00 and stockholders' equity at current levels.

	Cellectar Biosciences to Present

	Annual Biotech Showcase



	 


	Madison, Wis. (January 5, 2017) -- Cellectar Biosciences,
	Inc. (Nasdaq: CLRB), an oncology-focused, clinical stage biotechnology company, announces today that President and CEO, Jim Caruso
	will present at the Biotech Showcase in San Francisco on January 11, 2017 at 10:00 AM PT in Room 2 (Ballroom Level).


	 


	“We look forward to discussing the continued
	advancement of our lead PDC program, CLR 131, as well as providing relevant updates on our other product candidates and corporate
	performance,” said Mr. Caruso. “We always enjoy presenting at the Biotech Showcase, an important industry gathering
	that unites a unique combination of established and emerging companies with a large and diverse group of healthcare-oriented investors
	and potential partners.”


	 


	A live audio webcast and replay will be available
	on the investor relations section of Cellectar’s website at http://investor.cellectar.com/events.cfm.


	 



	About Phospholipid Drug Conjugates (PDCs)


	Cellectar’s product candidates are built upon its patented cancer cell-targeting delivery and retention platform of optimized
	phospholipid ether-drug conjugates (PDCs). The company deliberately designed its phospholipid ether (PLE) carrier platform to be
	coupled with a variety of payloads to facilitate both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The basis for selective tumor targeting
	of our PDC compounds lies in the differences between the plasma membranes of cancer cells compared to those of normal cells. Cancer
	cell membranes are highly enriched in lipid rafts, which are glycolipoprotein microdomains of the plasma membrane of cells that
	contain high concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids, and serve to organize cell surface and intracellular signaling molecules.
	PDCs have been tested in over 70 different xenograft models of cancer.


	 



	 




	 




	 



	About Cellectar Biosciences, Inc.


	Cellectar Biosciences is developing phospholipid drug conjugates (PDCs) designed to provide cancer targeted delivery of diverse
	oncologic payloads to a broad range of cancers and cancer stem cells. Cellectar's PDC platform is based on the company's proprietary
	phospholipid ether analogs. These novel small-molecules have demonstrated highly selective uptake and retention in a broad range
	of cancers. Cellectar's PDC pipeline includes product candidates for cancer therapy and cancer diagnostic imaging. The company's
	lead therapeutic PDC, CLR 131, utilizes iodine-131, a cytotoxic radioisotope, as its payload. CLR 131 is currently being evaluated
	under an orphan drug designated Phase I clinical study in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In addition,
	the company plans to initiate a Phase II clinical study to assess efficacy in a range of B-cell malignancies in the first quarter
	of 2017. The company is also developing PDCs for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel (CLR 1603-PTX), a preclinical
	stage product candidate, and plans to expand its PDC chemotherapeutic pipeline through both in-house and collaborative R&D
	efforts. For more information please visit www.cellectar.com.

Cellectar Biosciences, Inc. Announces Preclinical Data from Three Abstracts Demonstrating the Utility of the Company’s Lead Compound, CLR 131
May 18 17
Cellectar Biosciences, Inc. announced preclinical data from three abstracts demonstrating the utility of the company’s lead compound, CLR 131, for use in a variety of tumor types in single-dose and multi-dose regimens. The abstracts were published as part of the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings. In the first study, 20 mice were injected with glioma (brain) tumor cells (U87-MG). Investigators then injected two doses of CLR 131 (95.7µCi and 109.0 µCi on day 0 and day 7, respectively) or a control group of I-127-CLR 1404 (N=8 per group). The expected 25-fold increase in tumor burden observed in the control arm over the four-week study was reduced by 50% in the CLR 131 arm with additional survival benefit. In fact, the two doses of CLR 131 provided a 50% increase in survival over a single dose of CLR 131 in the same model. The second study involved female mice receiving two doses of CLR 131 (approximately 130 µCi and approximately 145 µCi at days 0 and 20, respectively) as well as a control group of I-127-CLR 1404 (N=8 per group), following injection of female mice with a MES SA/Dx5 cell line (human uterine sarcoma). This model was selected because of its high level of expression of resistance mechanisms these tumor cells exhibit, specifically P-gp efflux pumps that eject many chemotherapeutics from the cell. The active treatment group (CLR 131) experienced a 66% reduction of the expected 21-fold increase in tumor burden observed in the control group. This resulted in nearly doubling the survival time for the mice receiving two doses of CLR 131. The final study entailed the injection of mice with Caki-2 cell line (human clear cell carcinoma, common in renal cancer). Once tumor size reached a pre-determined volume, these mice received either a single dose of CLR 131 (approximately 110µCi), or a control of I-127-CLR 1404 (N=8 per group). The control group showed exponential growth at 20 days post-injection, while the treatment group experienced a reduction in the initial tumor volume through day 65 post-injection and had the same initial tumor volume at day 75 post-injection. By day 65, the control group increased 10.75-fold compared to the treatment group in average tumor volume.

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
