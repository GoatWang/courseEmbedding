As a progressive producer of premium wines, highlighting the viticulture movement and dynamic quality of Washington State's Columbia Valley, Revelry is a winery building a tradition of excellence. Revelry is the brainchild of northwest native Jared Burns. Jared, drawing on a unique and experience filled upbringing, adopted wine as personal passion at a young age, the son of self-made entrepreneur Dennis Burns, founder of Pro-Tec Helmets, Gargoyles Sunglasses, and the inventor of the synthetic wine cork. In 1998 Burns was awarded the Golden Grape Award for his pioneering ingenuity, the product of which forever changed the course of an industry and ultimately the quality of wine. With encouragement to color outside of the lines the younger Burns learned winemaking on the job, working with some of Washingtons finest winemakers.

FULL DESCRIPTIONThe Block 19 Syrah from Weinbau Vineyard on the Wahluke Slope was the first Syrah to exhibit the qualities we were looking for from the variety.  Made from the 877 clone, with its 'roots' (punn intended) in Southern France, this Syrah is produced with a focus on minimal intervention.  We leave it on its lees for an extended period of time, stirring those lees early in its cellaring.  The wine will spend 22 - 24 months in barrel.  It is unfined and unfiltered, with incredibly dark yet lively fruit, and a smoky aromatic substructure.

I'm really not sure why anyone would dislike Revelry. Amazing wine with a very cool vibe. Very memorable!!5Marcus M.08/17/2013Friendly staff, intimate tasting room. They pour mostly their highly allocated wines, and we snagged a 3-pack of their single block syrah. Definitely worth a visit!1Joe m.08/19/2009Maybe he should go sell packaging.

FEATURE WINES 







RANGEGRENACHE / SYRAHRANGE™ is the culmination of years of work refining two of our very best lots of fruit, our handling of those wines through the winemaking process - tons of analysis and effort, and a whole lot of luck.  After all of this, and one simple experiment in blending the AERIALS™ SERIES Block 18 Syrah with Grenache and this new wine was born.  The blend is unmistakably delicious.$42 / Btl

SHOP








D11 CABERNET SAUVIGNONSAGEMOOR VINEYARDThe D11 CABERNET SAUVIGNON is one of the most distinctive Cabernet Sauvignons you will find.  A product of the soils in which it is grown and the sites unique exposure, positioned on the eastern banks of the Columbia River, it is truly a powerful wine with layer upon layer of flavor, rich texture and a seemingly endless flavor profile. $60 / Btl

THE 'LIMITED EDITION'The LIMITED EDITION is definitely the sleeper pick of all the wines produced here at Revelry Vintners.  It is a blend of barrels handpicked from our AERIALS™ SERIES lots, with the goal of making a dynamic and layered red blend.  Sourced from: the Sagemoor Vineyard, Weinbau Vineyard, Heart of the Hill, and Alder Ridge Vineyard

  COLUMBIA VALLEY COLLECTION








THE COLUMBIA VALLEY COLLECTION IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED, WITH THE FIRST VINTAGE BACK IN 2005 AND A SIMPLE GOAL TO PRODUCE THREE WINES FROM THE COLUMBIA VALLEY IN OUR HOME STATE OF WASHINGTON.  THOUGH OUR COLLECTION OF WINES HAS INCREASED, OUR COMMITMENT TO THE SIMPLE EXCELLENCE THAT MADE THOSE FIRST THREE WINES UNIQUE REMAINS.
