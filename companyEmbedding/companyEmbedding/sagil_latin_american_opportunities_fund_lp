Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Sagil Capital is the investment advisor to the Sagil Latin American Opportunities Fund. The Fund is a US dollar denominated long-short equity fund seeking to generate attractive absolute returns in Latin America across three investment strategies; arbitrage, relative value, and directional. In addition to companies listed in the region, the Fund also invests in companies listed in other markets with significant exposure to Latin America. Our investment philosophy is governed by two primary objectives - first to ensure that we preserve investor capital and second that we optimise the risk/reward profile of the portfolio for our investors. We perform independent in-house research and analysis to identify investment opportunities. Our in-depth bottom-up company analysis is complemented with top-down research. Sagil employs a value-orientated approach to investing. We perform detailed financial statement analysis and meet regularly with companies to gain first-hand knowledge of financial performance, strategy, management and future prospects. We seek to confirm our thoughts and findings by comparing results to other companies in the same industry and by checking data to independent sources. Risk is managed continually and is an integral part of our asset allocation and portfolio construction process. We ensure that diversification is in place to reduce risks. AUM reflects the aggregate of both share classes. Redemption fees apply for withdrawals in Class B within 6 months.
