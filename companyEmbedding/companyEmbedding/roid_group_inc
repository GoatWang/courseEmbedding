(1) Offering expenses have been rounded to $22,000 and have heretofore been 
    partially paid from the proceeds from the Company’s Private Placement 
    Offering.                                          
     
(2)  Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be held in reserve as 
     working capital and subject to reallocation to other line item expenditures
     as required for ongoing operations. 

If 100% of the offered Shares are sold the Company will receive the maximum
proceeds of $1,178,000 after paying the Company’s offering expenses. The Company
plans to allocate the net proceeds from this Offering as follows: $300,000
towards the salaries of the officers, directors, employees, and independent
contractors, $50,000 for the corporate lease payments, $70,000 for marketing, 
$590,000 for manufacturing equipment, factory lease and raw materials. We will
allocate $50,000for insurance for the directors, officers, products, and general
liabilities.

If 75% of the offered Shares are sold the Company will receive $878,000, after
paying offering expenses.  In this case, the Company plans to cut the staffing
budget to $225,000, cut the manufacturing equipment, factory lease and raw
material budget to $435,000, reduce the lease expense to $37,500 and lower the
marketing budget to $52,500. In this instance, the Company’s president may work
more on our technology and growing the company because we will still have enough
money to hire an assistant, who will be able to relieve much of the bookkeeping
and ad ministerial load. The Company plans to allocate the remaining proceeds as
follows: $7,500 to travel, $22,500 to media commercials.  We will allocate
$37,500for insurance for the directors, officers, products, and general
liabilities.

If 50% of the offered Shares are sold the Company would receive $578,000, after
paying offering expenses. The Company would further cut the staffing budget for
the officers, directors, employees and independent contractors to $150,000. The
Company would not be able to hire an assistant to bear some of the ad
ministerial duties and office workload, which will result in the president
allocating more time to those activities.  The Company still plans on spending
$275,000 to purchase manufacturing equipment, lease a factory and purchase raw
materials; however, it would significantly cut the marketing budget to $35,000
and the media commercials for the television and internet allotment to $15,000.
The Company plans to cut the earmark on the corporate office lease to $30,000
and reduce the travel budget to $5,000. We will still allocate $25,000 for
insurance for the directors, officers, products, and general liabilities.

If the Company sells10% of theShares under the Offering it would be severely
restricted in its operating plans and only have sufficient proceeds to cover
offering expenses, operate the Company for the year, and it will have to pay the
remainder of the expenses out of additional financing which it has not yet
received. The Company will not have sufficient proceeds to hire any staff and
initiate growth. In this instance, it will have to seek out additional capital
from alternate sources to fully execute the plan of operations. If such funds
are not available the business would likely fail and any investment would be
lost.

The funds from this Offering will be used to pay Dr. Kwanghyun Kim and Dr.
Dokyung Kim for their services to the Company, prior to, during, and subsequent
to the Offering. There can be no assurance that the Company will raise any funds
through this Offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised, the Company
will use such funds according to its best judgment in accordance with the
foregoing “Use of Proceeds” chart and the explanations thereto. This discretion
is not unlimited and any such change in the use of proceeds as discussed above
would be restricted to a proportionate reduction in funds allocated to each
specific item listed, and would not differ materially from the “Use of Proceeds”
chart. To the extent the offering proceeds do not cover any professional fees
incurred by the Company, management anticipates paying for any such expenses out
of any additional funding or revenues the Company receive.

If the Company requires additional funding, it will seek such funds from
friends, family, and business acquaintances of the officers and directors in
order to continue operations. As with any form of financing, there are
uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds, and the likelihood that
such funds will be available to the Company on acceptable terms since the
Company has not received any firm commitments or indications of interest from
the friends, family members, or business acquaintances of the officers and
directors regarding potential investments in the Company.


Existing companies in the QD market are currently facing theabsence of a mass
production technique and without that mass production technique they cannot
satisfy the needs oftoday’s market. Thus many of our competitors’ market
strategies areto sell small amounts of QDs at extremely high prices. Our notable
competitive strengthsare that we have a mass production technique, have
influential QD scientists on our board of directors,and can produce our QDs at a
lower cost. Thus we should be able to fulfill a large portion of the consumers
demand for QDs.

According to BCC Research, total Sales in the QD Market will be $670M in 2015 at
a CAGR of 85.3% while another research facility, MarketsandMarkets predicted
that the total sales of QD market in 2022 will be $748M at a CAGR of 55.2%.

The Company is subject to other competitive risks of early stage and commercial
businesses generally, and of advanced technology businesses in particular,
including competing in an environment where other companies may be better
financed or have more experience that the Company.


Company Description
Our general business strategy is to market Quantum Dots (“Quantum Dot” or “QD”).
A Quantum Dot is a is a nanocrystal made of a material that has an electrical
conductivity that are small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties,
typically between 2 and 10 nanometers (a billionth of a meter)


 in diameter or
mean dimension, which emit light fluorescence or electrons when excited with
energy. The Emission or absorption wavelength can be tuned by the creation of
quantum dots of different sizes. The smaller the quantum dot, the closer it is
to the blue end of the spectrum, and the larger the quantum dot, the closer it
is to the red end of the spectrum. The unique physical properties of quantum
dots exist as electrons within the quantum dot and are confined to a very small
space which makes them subject to certain “quantum” effects. These qualities are
driving demand for quantum dots as a performance and efficiency enhancing next
generation engineered material, and have led to the use of quantum dots in a
range of electronic and other applications, including in the optoelectronic
(display), lighting and life sciences industries. Quantum Dots can be used in
bio-imaging, this includes the use of quantum dots for marking (illuminating)
particular cell types or metabolic processes for understanding diseases and
conditions as well as the use of quantum dots to act as delivery agents for drug
treatments or therapy for a wide range of ailments. The fluorescent qualities of
quantum dots provide an attractive alternative to traditional organic dyes in
bio-imaging procedures and are able to image a number of different color
wavelengths simultaneously. Quantum dots are able to withstand irradiation from
high powered microscopes for longer periods than organic dyes, and have been
widely adopted in the bio-imaging sector. Our QD materials for bio-imaging in
laboratories(in vitro) have already been developed by us in South Korea in a lab
size limited production, our ability to obtain the necessary financing to
complete the development of full scale production and profitable manufacturing
is dependent on raising money in the future.
