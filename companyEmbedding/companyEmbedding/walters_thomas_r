Search Tips







Tips for using the standard site search

Start by typing your search terms in the search box at the upper right. This will search product name, manufacturer name, item number, product description, and scale.
Note: The more terms you enter, the more focused (fewer results) your search will be. (The search uses what is called an and operator.)
Example: Searching boxcar generates more than 6,000 results from our active catalog. Searching boxcar HO generates more than 3,000 results. Searching boxcar HO 40' generates approximately 1,000 results. 

If you can’t find what you’re looking for by searching for key words, enter fewer terms and use the navigation to narrow your search.

Some manufacturers may use alternate spellings for car type, road name, etc. If you don’t find an item that you expected, entering fewer terms and using the navigation may help.

If you want to focus your results even more, click the show filters tab at the left edge of the page to open the navigation. (Normally, the filters are already visible.) Then click on show categories and use the filters to focus your search.
Example: Filtering our boxcar HO 40' search for New York Central under Road Name narrows it to approximately 50 results.
To remove a filter, simply click the x at the upper right corner of that section. To remove all filters, click clear all at the top of the left-hand column.

Entering a new term in the box starts a new search.

You can change your results from grid form to list form (and back) using the buttons at the upper right of the page.

The system will suggest related search terms you may wish to try.

If you would like to search our entire active catalog without entering a search term, click "search with filters", found under the main search box. Then use use any of the filters (for example scale, category, manufacturer, or roadname) to narrow your search. Entering a term in the search box while searching will begin a new search. 

To search within the listings for a particular scale, category, or manufacturer, to search discontinued items, or to search within sale items, use the advanced search.
