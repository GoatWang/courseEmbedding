Former Ceridian CEO Stuart C. Harvey Jr. Appointed Piper Jaffray Merchant Banking Partner | Business Wire
























































Former Ceridian CEO Stuart C. Harvey Jr. Appointed Piper Jaffray 
      Merchant Banking Partner






August 17, 2015 09:57 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Piper 
      Jaffray Companies (NYSE:PJC), a leading investment bank and asset 
      management firm, is pleased to announce the hiring of Stuart C. Harvey 
      Jr. as a partner in the Piper Jaffray merchant banking group. The group 
      manages private equity investments in commercial businesses with strong 
      growth prospects.
    


      Harvey previously served as a managing director at Piper Jaffray from 
      1993-2003, and will be rejoining the firm as the merchant banking group 
      prepares to raise a new fund in 2016. The group closed its $100 million 
      Piper Jaffray Merchant Banking Fund I, L.P. in 2012.
    

      From 2003-2010, Harvey served as CEO of Elavon Global Acquiring 
      Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, growing revenues to more 
      than $1.5 billion. He joined Ceridian Corporation in 2010 where he 
      served as chairman, CEO and president. During his tenure, he transformed 
      company strategy, vision and operations on a national and international 
      level, leading to sharp increases in sales and operating efficiency. 
      Harvey also led the sale of Comdata, Inc., a Ceridian subsidiary, to 
      FleetCor Technologies, Inc. for $3.45 billion.
    

      “Stuart has a proven track record for building successful companies and 
      he will be highly valuable as we expand our portfolio,” said Tom 
      Schnettler, merchant banking managing director and vice chairman of 
      Piper Jaffray & Co. “In less than five years, he was able to 
      dramatically transform the business of Ceridian Corporation, resulting 
      in significant increases in shareholder value. We look forward to 
      utilizing Stuart’s skills in creating value for our investors.”
    

      “I am honored to be named a merchant banking partner, working alongside 
      Tom Schnettler, Bob Rinek and David Crosby. They are a veteran group of 
      individuals that is well-respected throughout the industry; their record 
      of investment in quality companies is very impressive and I am eager to 
      join them,” said Harvey.
    

      Harvey holds a bachelor’s degree from St. John’s University, a Juris 
      doctorate from the George Washington University Law School and a 
      Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of 
      Management at Northwestern University. He also serves on the board of 
      directors for Trustwave Holdings, Inc. and the board of trustees at St. 
      John’s University.

Piper Jaffray names Stuart C. Harvey, Jr. President and COO (Photo: Piper Jaffray).  


      In this role, Harvey will assume responsibility for leading the
      operations of the company’s global investment banking, institutional
      securities and asset management businesses. Harvey’s appointment will be
      effective November 7, when he will join the Piper Jaffray leadership
      team, reporting to Piper Jaffray chairman and CEO Andrew
      Duff.
    

      Harvey rejoined Piper Jaffray in August 2015 as a partner in its merchant
      banking group, having previously served as a managing director at
      Piper Jaffray in its investment banking group from 1993 to 2003. From
      2003 to 2010, Harvey was with Elavon Global Acquiring Solutions, Inc., a
      subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, becoming president in 2005 and CEO in 2008,
      where he had global responsibility for the business, including leading
      its international expansion efforts. In 2010, Harvey became the
      chairman, CEO, and president of Ceridian Corporation, a provider of
      human capital management software and services. In October 2013, he
      became the chairman and CEO of Comdata, Inc., a subsidiary that was
      split off by Ceridian that managed fleet and corporate card payments and
      services, while continuing to serve as executive chairman of Ceridian.
      During his tenure at Ceridian, Harvey was responsible for driving
      significant improvements in the company’s performance through the
      development of advanced service offerings and increased operating and
      sales efficiency. He directed Ceridian’s acquisition of Dayforce Corp.
      in 2012, and the sale of Comdata, Inc. to Fleetcor Technologies, Inc.
      for $3.45 billion in 2014.
    

      "As we look to continue our multi-year effort to transform and drive
      performance across all of our businesses, the timing is right for Stuart
      to step into this role. Stuart has a breadth of experience leading and
      building successful companies. That experience, combined with his deep
      knowledge of and passion for our industry and Piper Jaffray, make him an
      ideal choice to serve as president and COO," said Duff.
    

      "I am honored to be named president and COO of Piper Jaffray. We are a
      dynamic firm filled with incredibly talented, dedicated professionals,
      with a 121-year history of providing first-in-class service and advice
      to our clients. I am eager to have the opportunity to contribute to the
      significant momentum that we’ve been building over the past several
      years," said Harvey.
    

      Harvey holds a bachelor's degree from Saint John's University, a Juris
      doctorate from The George Washington University Law School and a
      Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of
      Management at Northwestern University. He also serves on the board of
      directors of Trustwave Holdings, Inc. and the board of trustees of Saint
      John's University.
