Gyn Cancer Nurses








for your care, comfort and well-being

Left to Right: Mica Travers, RN; Susan Hiller, RN; Debbie Montoya, LPN; and Mindy Commiskey, RN


Their expertise in chemotherapy shines through with compassion, understanding and a positive approach that is at the heart of our mission at Southwest Gynecologic Oncology Associates.
Along with Dr. Finkelstein, our experienced nursing staff offers comprehensive, holistic, dedicated and individualized care from beginning to end for women with gynecologic malignancies in the southwest region of the U.S.




 
 
Oncology Certified Nurse:
Susan Hiller, RN
I consider nursing a lifelong passion, vocation, and profession. I graduated from the University of New Mexico in 1974 with my Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Graduation was just the beginning of a long and varied career, or should I say, adventure.
I have worked with one pound babies in the NICU, challenges in the SICU, various issues in Home health, excitement in the ER, “darling” children in school nursing, and served eight years in the Wyoming Air National Guard as a flight nurse for air evacuation in both Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.
Throughout these adventures, oncology has come and gone, always leaving an imprint on my heart. That brings me to the present…..SW Gynecologic Oncology Associates, Inc. where my passion is fed daily by our “ladies”. I am also the Program Chair for the Albuquerque Chapter of the Oncology Nursing Society. I arrange educational meetings for the oncology nurses of our area to promote excellence in our chosen field.
 
Oncology Certified Nurse:
Mindy Commiskey, RN
Mindy was born and raised in Muncie, Indiana. She moved to New Mexico after graduating from Ball State University with her BSN in 2006. She chose the nursing profession, specifically oncology nursing, after her own battle with leukemia.
She spent her first year as a nurse on a general medical floor before spending four years on the in-patient oncology unit at Presbyterian Hospital. She has been with our office since 2010, and enjoys not only the out-patient setting, but also working with our special population.
Mindy takes pride in being a member of the following professional organizations; Society of Gynecologic Nurse Oncologists (SGNO), Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), and the local Albuquerque Chapter of the Oncology Nursing Society (ACONS). She is currently pursuing her Oncology Nursing Certification (ONC). Mindy lives in the East Mountains with her husband, dog, and chickens. She enjoys spending time outdoors, traveling, cooking, reading, and digging in the garden.
 
Chemotherapy Infusion Registered Nurse:
Mica Travers, RN
Mica Travers has been a chemo infusion Registered nurse at Southwest Gynecologic Oncology Associates since 2010. She decided to work in Oncology to try something new and to help patients in an outpatient setting where there is more time to spend with patients.
She graduated from UNM in 2004 with her Bachelor of Science in Nursing. She worked at Presbyterian Hospital as a Cardiac Registered Nurse, in Las Vegas, Nevada as an Intermediate Care Registered Nurse, and as a School Nurse for Charter Schools in the Albuquerque area. She is also a current member of the Albuquerque Chapter of the Oncology Nursing Society.
Mica works part time and cares for her 6-year old twins who keep her very busy.
 
Licensed Practical Nurse:
Debbie Montoya, LPN
Debbie was born and raised in Clayton, New Mexico. She has worked in many facets of the medical field. Gynecologic Oncology chose her! It became her passion after her dear friend Sally lost her battle to cervical cancer.
Debbie attended Vernon Regional Junior College in Wichita Falls, Texas and became an LPN in 1987. She has been with Southwest Gynecologic Oncology Associates for over five years. She believes it has been the most rewarding of all medical areas that she has worked in.
Debbie lived in Wiesbaden West Germany, Anchorage Alaska and Liberal Kansas before calling Albuquerque her home. She admits to admiring the women in her life who were in the medical profession, especially her Mother Adelina who is now a retired Respiratory Therapist. Debbie resides in Albuquerque along with her husband of three years, Michael. She has three children, Aaron, Adam and Alyssa.

Dr. Lisa N. Abaid  & Dr. John V. Brown Named As Orange County’s Top Doctors !!!
Every year, Orange Coast magazine commissions a study of local physicians to determine who they feel are the top doctors within 58 different specialties and sub-specialties. This year Dr. Lisa N. Abaid and Dr. John V. Brown were selected as one of the top gynecologic oncologist doctors in the Orange County area.  Congratulations to Dr. Abaid and Dr. Brown and the entire team at Gynecologic Oncology Associates for setting a higher standard for hearing health in Orange County!

 

 
 
 
When the diagnosis is cancer, everything in a woman’s life changes. Dreams get put on hold. The future becomes a question mark. Uncertainty and fear may become constant companions, and cloud even the best relationships.
You are not alone. Thousands of women have found a way to regain their lives after a cancer diagnosis. Finding a correct diagnosis—-and specialized, expert treatment—is key to restoring your quality of life.



For more than 25 years, Gynecologic Oncology Associates (GOA) has cared for more women with female cancers on a yearly basis than any other practice in Orange County. We are the leaders in Southern California for treating all women’s cancers, in one intimate and inclusive setting.
No other group provides comprehensive diagnosis and treatment for gynecologic cancer —and access to clinical trials— all within the same practice. That means better continuity of care, state-of the art treatment including the latest robotic and advanced endoscopic surgical techniques, and more convenience for patients at a vulnerable time in their lives. We even usher you toward a better quality of life for follow-up and rehabilitative care after treatment is finished.
To learn why GOA is the most comprehensive treatment destination for women’s cancers, click here.








The GOA Research Team oversees an active clinical research program through the Women’s Cancer Research Foundation (WCRF) . These efforts continually produce exciting advancements in the care of gynecologic malignancies.
