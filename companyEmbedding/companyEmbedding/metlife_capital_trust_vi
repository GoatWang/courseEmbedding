                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Trust is a statutory trust formed under Delaware law and pursuant to a Declaration of Trust that MetLife signed as sponsor. As sponsor, MetLife is currently the sole beneficial owner of the Trust.[1] 
           MetLife, a Delaware corporation, is an insurance holding company that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, offers life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners insurance, retail banking and other financial services to individuals, as well as group insurance and retirement and savings products and services to corporations and other institutions.[2] 

2. The Trust was formed for the purpose of funding the operations of MetLife or its Controlled Companies through the issuance of debt securities or non-voting preferred stock (the “Finance Subsidiary Securities”). The Trust has not yet begun operations.
3. MetLife currently contemplates that a MetLife Finance Subsidiary will offer Finance Subsidiary Securities in private placement transactions in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or through public offerings that are registered under the Securities Act. Start Printed Page 1008Applicants propose to use the proceeds from any such offerings to finance the business operations of the MetLife Finance Subsidiary's Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company.
4. A Parent Company will unconditionally guarantee in conformity with rule 3a-5, any debt securities constituting Finance Subsidiary Securities as to payment of principal, interest and premium, if any, and any non-voting preferred securities constituting Finance Subsidiary Securities as to the payment of dividends, liquidation preference and sinking fund payments, if any. The guarantee will provide that, in the event of a default by the MetLife Finance Subsidiary in payment of any such amount, the holders of Finance Subsidiary Securities may institute legal proceedings directly against the Parent Company that guaranteed the Finance Subsidiary Securities to enforce the guarantee without first proceeding against the MetLife Finance Subsidiary.
5. Any Finance Subsidiary Securities that are convertible or exchangeable will be convertible or exchangeable only for securities issued by the Parent Company that guaranteed the Finance Subsidiary Securities or for other securities issued by the MetLife Finance Subsidiary that meet the applicable requirements of rule 3a-5(a)(1) through (a)(3) of the Act. Each MetLife Finance Subsidiary, through loans or an investment, will transfer at least 85% of the proceeds from the sale of the Finance Subsidiary Securities to its Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company as soon as practicable, but in no event later than six months after receipt of such proceeds.
Applicant's Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from all provisions of the Act. Rule 3a-5 under the Act provides an exemption from the definition of investment company for certain companies organized primarily to finance the business operations of their parent companies or companies controlled by their parent companies.
2. Rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i) in relevant part defines a “parent company” to be any corporation, partnership, or joint venture that is not considered an investment company under section 3(a) of the Act or that is excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company by section 3(b) of the Act or by the rules or regulations under section 3(a) of the Act. Applicants state that while MetLife is not an investment company within the definition of section 3(a) of the Act, MetLife may in the future, choose to rely on section 3(c)(6) of the Act for an exclusion from the definition of an investment company. To the extent MetLife or another Parent Company derives its non-investment company status from section 3(c)(6) of the Act, MetLife would not qualify as an eligible parent company under rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i). Accordingly, applicants request exemptive relief to permit MetLife or another Parent Company that does not satisfy a portion of the definition of a “parent company” in rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i) solely because it is an “insurance company” or “bank” as defined in section 2(a) of the Act and is excepted from the definition of an investment company under sections 3(c)(3) or 3(c)(6) of the Act or a holding company primarily engaged in the business of an insurance company or a bank that is excepted from the definition of an investment company under section 3(c)(6) of the Act to guarantee Finance Subsidiary Securities issued by a MetLife Finance Subsidiary that is wholly-owned by the Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company.
3. Rule 3a-5(b)(3)(i) in relevant part defines a “company controlled by the parent company” to be any corporation, partnership, or joint venture that is not considered an investment company under section 3(a) of the Act or that is excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company by section 3(b) of the Act or by the rules and regulations under section 3(a) of the Act. MetLife requests exemptive relief to permit a Controlled Company of the Parent Company that is excepted from the definition of an investment company under section 3(c)(2), 3(c)(3), 3(c)(4), 3(c)(5)(A), 3(c)(5)(B) or 3(c)(6) of the Act to receive funds from a MetLife Finance Subsidiary that is wholly owned by its Parent Company or a Controlled Company of the Parent Company.
4. Applicants state that the purpose of each MetLife Financing Subsidiary is to provide funds for the operations of its Parent Company or Controlled Company of the Parent Company. Applicants state that neither any Parent Company nor any Controlled Company of the Parent Company presents the potential for investment company activities.
5. Applicants seek exemptive relief that would include Parent Companies that have not been named as applicants to the application. Without the requested relief, a newly acquired MetLife insurance company or bank subsidiary that may seek (or such existing subsidiary that may determine in the future) to act as a “parent company” within the meaning of rule 3a-5 would have to submit another application seeking essentially the same relief as sought here. Such an application would not raise any significant issue that applicants have not already analyzed in the application.
6. Section 6(c) of the Act, in pertinent part, provides that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the exemptive request meets the standards set forth in section 6(c) of the Act.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
Applicants will comply with all of the provisions of rule 3a-5 under the Act, except that:
(1) A Parent Company may not meet the portion of the definition of a “parent company” in rule 3a-5(b)(2)(i) solely because it is excluded from the definition of an investment company under sections 3(c)(3) or 3(c)(6) of the Act; and
(2) a Controlled Company of the Parent Company may not meet the portion of the definition of a “company controlled by the parent company” in rule 3a-5(b)(3)(i) solely because it is excluded from the definition of an investment company under sections 3(c)(2), 3(c)(3), 3(c)(4), 3(c)(5)(A), 3(c)(5)(B) or 3(c)(6) of the Act;

provided that:

(a) any Controlled Company of the Parent Company excluded from the definition of investment company under section 3(c)(5) of the Act will fall within section 3(c)(5)(A) or section 3(c)(5)(B) solely by reason of its holdings of accounts receivable of either its own customers or the customers of another Controlled Company of the Parent Company, or by reason of loans made to its customers or the customers of another Controlled Company of the Parent Company; and
(b) any Parent Company or Controlled Company of a Parent Company excluded from the definition of investment company under section 3(c)(6) of the Act will not engage primarily, directly, or through majority-owned subsidiaries in one or more of the businesses described in section 3(c)(5) of the Act (except as permitted by (a) above).

1.
     If the Trust issues common securities, MetLife or a Controlled Company (defined below) will own all of the common securities issued by the Trust. MetLife, as sponsor, will at all times control the Trust in all material respects, including having the sole right to select, remove or replace the Trust administrators. A Controlled Company may be a wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary of MetLife through which MetLife conducts its insurance, banking and broker-dealer business, or an entity that is or would be, after giving effect to the requested order, “controlled by” MetLife within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of rule 3a-5 under the Act.

2.
     Applicants request that the order also apply to any existing or future company controlled by MetLife that is an insurance company or a bank (as defined in section 2(a) of the Act) or a holding company primarily engaged in the business of an insurance company or a bank, that relies on section 3(c)(3) and/or section 3(c)(6) of the Act, and that, except for its reliance on section 3(c)(3) and/or section 3(c)(6), acts as a “parent company” within the meaning of rule 3a-5 under the Act (such companies, together with MetLife, “Parent Companies” and each, individually, a “Parent Company”) and to certain finance subsidiaries wholly owned by a Parent Company or a controlled company of such Parent Company (“Controlled Company of the Parent Company”) that currently exist or that may be established or acquired in the future (such finance subsidiaries, together with the Trust, “MetLife Finance Subsidiaries”). The Trust is the only MetLife Finance Subsidiary that presently intends to rely on the requested order.

Rating Action: Moody's confirms MetLife's ratings (A3 senior); downgrades financial strength of Brighthouse subsidiaries to A3






                    Global Credit Research - 05 Oct 2016
                









New York, October 05, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service today confirmed MetLife, Inc.'s 
(MetLife; NYSE: MET) long-term credit ratings (senior 
debt at A3) and the Aa3 insurance financial strength (IFS) ratings of 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC), General American Life 
Insurance Company and Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company (collectively 
called RemainCo). In the same rating action, Moody's 
downgraded the IFS ratings of MetLife Insurance Company USA and New England 
Life Insurance Company to A3 from Aa3. These two operating companies, 
along with First MetLife Investors Insurance Company (not rated), 
will separate from MetLife and reside under newly formed holding company, 
Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse, unrated) 
as disclosed in the SEC Form 10 statement Brighthouse filed today. 
The IFS rating of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) was unaffected 
by this rating action. The outlook for the ratings is stable.




These actions conclude a review for downgrade of MetLife's ratings 
initiated on January 13, 2016, following MetLife's announcement 
that it intended to pursue the separation and potential disposition (through 
IPO, spin-off, or sale) of a substantial portion of 
its US Retail segment. The businesses transferred to Brighthouse, 
which totaled about $227 billion of assets as of December 31, 
2015, will contain the majority of MetLife's more capital intensive 
and volatile retail product lines such as variable annuities with guaranteed 
living benefits and universal life with secondary guarantees. The 
rating agency noted as of December 31, 2015, the new company 
would represent about 20% of the operating earnings of MetLife 
and 50% of the operating earnings of the US Retail segment. 
MetLife will continue to participate in all of its other segments: 
Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit 
Funding, Asia, Latin America and Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa.


Please refer to the complete list of rating actions below.




RATINGS RATIONALE




MetLife's Remaining US Life Businesses


The confirmation of the Aa3 IFS ratings of MetLife's remaining US 
life businesses is based on their very strong market positions in the 
US with excellent brand recognition, significant operating scale 
in group insurance businesses, diversified and controlled distribution, 
as well as a substantial capital base. Although the separation 
of the majority of MetLife's US Retail business will reduce the 
company's overall market footprint, the remaining operations 
will still rank as one of the leading US Life operations, with top 
market positions in the US Life group insurance market and Corporate Benefit 
Funding (CBF, includes GICs and other institutional products). 
Prospective profitability is also expected to be less constrained than 
seen historically, due to the expected reduced levels of volatility 
and lower hedging costs as a result of the transfer of the majority of 
the US retail business to Brighthouse. These strengths are mitigated 
to some extent by remaining risk exposures related to managing a book 
of run-off legacy variable annuities, although this block 
is mostly without guarantees, as well as relatively large exposure 
to high-risk assets including alternative investments. Additionally, 
earnings and cash flow coverage ratios have historically been below rating 
level expectations, though the metrics have trended higher recently.




The following factors could lead to an upgrade of the IFS ratings of the 
operating entities of RemainCo: 1) high risk assets ratio as a percentage 
of shareholders' equity below 100% on a statutory accounting 
basis; 2) NAIC Combined RBC ratio of principal US life insurance 
subsidiaries consistently above 425% (company action level), 
after adjusting for captive reinsurers; 3) adjusted financial leverage 
(excluding AOCI) less than 20% range; and 4) earnings and 
cash flow coverage above 8x and 6x, respectively.


Conversely, the following factors could lead to a downgrade of the 
IFS ratings of the operating entities of RemainCo: 1) securities 
lending and institutional funding agreement-backed issuances growing 
disproportionately relative to the consolidated company; 2) NAIC 
Combined RBC ratio of principal US life insurance subsidiaries falling 
below 350% (company action level), after adjusting for captive 
reinsurers; 3) adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) above 
30%; or 4) earnings and cash flow coverage below 6x and 4x, 
respectively.




MetLife, Inc.


Commenting on the confirmation, Moody's said that in addition 
to its US market leading positions discussed above, the company 
has leading positions in various international insurance markets within 
Latin America and Asia. Although MetLife will have a weaker business 
profile due to a diminished market position in the US retail life and 
annuity markets and reduced diversity of distribution and earnings, 
this will be more than offset by the company's reduced exposure to higher 
risk insurance products such as variable annuities with generous living 
benefit guarantees. Going forward, Moody's expects 
MetLife to maintain an adjusted financial leverage ratio (excluding AOCI) 
of less than 30% and holding company cash of at least 2x fixed 
charges following the separation of the Brighthouse subsidiaries. 
NAIC risk based capital at the operating entities is expected to be greater 
than 400% (company action level), after adjusting for captive 
reinsurers.




The A3 senior debt rating of MetLife is three notches lower than the average 
IFS rating of its principal US and non-US operating subsidiaries, 
which is standard for US holding companies.




The following factors could lead to an upgrade of MetLife's ratings: 
1) upgrade of MetLife's US subsidiaries or ALICO's stand-alone 
credit profile; 2) adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) less 
than 20% range; and 3) earnings and cash flow coverage above 
8x and 6x times, respectively. Conversely, the following 
factors could lead to a downgrade of MetLife's ratings: 1) downgrade 
of MetLife's US subsidiaries or ALICO's stand-alone credit profile; 
2) adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) above 30%; 
3) earnings and cash flow coverage below 6x and 4x, respectively; 
or 4) large acquisition in emerging markets whose operations have a significantly 
lower credit profile.




Brighthouse Insurance Subsidiaries


Moody's downgrade of the ratings of the operating subsidiaries that will 
be part of Brighthouse is largely driven by their materially weaker business 
profile. Notably, this business will contain the majority 
of MetLife's more capital intensive and volatile retail product lines, 
such as variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and universal 
life with secondary guarantees. The rating agency recognizes the 
experience and strong track record the management team brings to the new 
franchise; however, the company will not have the benefits 
of being part of the larger MetLife organization. The new company 
has a smaller, less diversified product set, and will exhibit 
a more volatile credit profile relative to the credit profile of the businesses 
to be retained by MetLife. Commenting on the strengths, Moody's 
said that asset risk is expected to improve relative to the current level 
of MetLife, with modest amount of exposure to high-risk assets, 
namely below-investment grade securities and alternative investments 
(9% of total invested assets at year-end 2015). Moody's 
also noted that the company's capital adequacy, as measured by the 
NAIC RBC ratio at year-end 2015, was 689% (company 
action level), although the company maintains such a high level 
of RBC ratio in part to proactively manage the volatility and tail risk 
associated with the variable annuity block.




The following factors could lead to an upgrade of the IFS ratings of Brighthouse 
subsidiaries: 1) run-rate statutory capital generation in 
excess of $500 million; 2) shift in the business mix towards 
more protection-oriented products (e.g. life insurance); 
and 3) earnings and cash flow coverage above 6x and 4x, respectively. 
Conversely, the following factors could lead to a downgrade of the 
IFS ratings of Brighthouse subsidiaries: 1) organic capital generation 
diminishes and GAAP return on capital less than 5%; 2) earnings 
and cash flow coverage below 4x and 2x, respectively; or 3) 
adjusted financial leverage (excluding AOCI) above 30%.




The following ratings have been confirmed:


MetLife, Inc. - senior unsecured debt at A3; 
provisional senior debt shelf at (P)A3; provisional subordinated 
debt shelf at (P)Baa1; provisional preferred shelf at (P)Baa2;

MetLife Institutional Funding II - funding agreement backed senior

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws.

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT
 
                                                                  
June 15, 2005
 
To the Representatives of the several
Underwriters named in the respective
Pricing Agreements hereinafter
described
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
      From time
to time, MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
MetLife Capital Trust II, a statutory trust
formed under the laws of Delaware
(the "Series A Trust") and MetLife Capital
Trust III, a statutory trust formed
under the laws of Delaware (the "Series B
Trust", and together with the Series A
Trust, the "Trusts") propose to enter into
one or more Pricing Agreements (each
a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex
I hereto, with such additions and
deletions as the parties thereto may
determine and, subject to the terms and
conditions stated herein and therein, to
issue and sell to the firms named in
Schedule I to the applicable Pricing
Agreement (the "Underwriters" with respect
to such Pricing Agreement and the
securities specified therein) the number of
common equity units specified in Schedule I
to the Pricing Agreement (the
"Securities") of the Company, each with an
initial stated amount of $25.00 and
consisting of (i) a stock purchase contract
(each, a "Stock Purchase Contract")
under which the holder will agree to
purchase and the Company will agree to sell
on each of two dates (each, a "Stock
Purchase Date") determined in or pursuant
to the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement
(as defined below) for a price of
$12.50 per security a number of shares of
common stock (the "Issuable Common
Stock") of the Company, par value $0.01 per
share (the "Common Stock"),
determined pursuant to the terms of Stock
Purchase Contract, (ii) a 1/80, or
1.25%, undivided beneficial ownership
interest in a Series A Trust Preferred
Security (securities of such series, the
"Series A Trust Preferred Securities")
of the Series A Trust with an initial
liquidation amount of $1,000, and (iii) a
1/80, or 1.25%, undivided beneficial
ownership interest in a Series B Trust
Preferred Security (securities of such
series, the "Series B Trust Preferred
Securities," and together with the Series A
Trust Preferred Securities, each a
series of "Trust Preferred Securities") of
the Series B Trust with an initial
liquidation amount of $1,000, and as
identified in Schedule II to the applicable
Pricing Agreement.
 
      The
Company and the Trusts are referred to herein, individually or

      Each
series of the Trust Preferred Securities will be guaranteed by
the

distributions and payments upon
liquidation, redemption and otherwise, to
the extent set forth in the related
Guarantee Agreement (each a "Guarantee
<PAGE>
Agreement"), to be dated as of the Closing
Date between the Company and J.P.
Morgan Trust Company, National Association
as trustee (in respect of each
Guarantee Agreement, the "Guarantee
Trustee").
 
      A holder's
ownership interest in the Trust Preferred Securities initially
will be pledged to secure such holder's
obligation to purchase Common Stock on
each Stock Purchase Date, such pledge to be
on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Pledge Agreement (the "Pledge
Agreement"), to be dated as of the
Closing Date, among the Company, JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association as

      A holder
of Normal Common Equity Units, at its option, may elect to
create
"Stripped Common Equity Units" by
substituting pledged U.S. treasury securities
for any pledged ownership interests in the
Trust Preferred Securities. Unless
otherwise indicated, the term "Common
Equity Units" includes both Normal Common
Equity Units and Stripped Common Equity
Units.
 
      The Series
A Trust will issue to the Company common units of beneficial
interest (the "Series A Trust Common
Securities"), representing undivided
beneficial ownersship interests in the
assets of the Series A Trust. The Company
will issue to the Series A Trust Junior
Subordinated Debt Securities, Series A
(the "Series A Debt Securities"). The
Series A Debt Securities will be issued
pursuant to the Subordinated Indenture to
be dated as of the Closing Date (the
"Base Indenture"), between the Company and
J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National
Association as trustee (the "Series A
Indenture Trustee"), and a supplement to
the Base Indenture, to be dated as of the
Closing Date (the "Series A
Supplemental Indenture" and, together with
the Base Indenture and any other
amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Series A Indenture").
 
      The Series
B Trust will issue to the Company common units of beneficial
interest (the "Series B Trust Common
Securities", and together with the Series A
Trust Common Securities, the "Trust Common
Securities"), representing undivided
beneficial ownership interests in the
assets of the Series B Trust. The Company
will issue to the Series B Trust Junior
Subordinated Debt Securities, Series B
(the "Series B Debt Securities", together
with the Series A Debt Securities, the
"Debt Securities"). The Series B Debt
Securities will be issued pursuant to the
Base Indenture, between the Company and
J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National
Association, as trustee (the "Series B
Indenture Trustee", and together with the
Series A Indenture Trustee, the "Indenture
Trustees"), and a supplement to the
Base Indenture, to be dated as of the
Closing Date (together with the Base
Indenture and any other amendments or
supplements thereto, the

<PAGE>
"Series B Indenture"). The Series A
Indenture and the Series B Indenture are
referred to herein, individually or
together, as the "Indentures".
 
      Pursuant
to a remarketing agreement (the "Remarketing Agreement") to be
entered into among the Company, the Series
A Trust, the Series B Trust, the
Stock Purchase Contract Agent and a
financial institution to be selected by the
Company to act as a reset agent and a
remarketing agent (together, the
"Remarketing Agent"), each series of Trust
Preferred Securities will be
remarketed, subject to certain terms and
conditions.
 
      The
"Component Securities" means, collectively, the Stock Purchase
Contracts, the Trust Preferred Securities,
the Debt Securities, the Guarantees
and the Issuable Common Stock.
 
      The terms
and rights of any particular issuance of Securities (including
the Component Securities) shall be as
specified in (i) the Pricing Agreement
relating thereto, (ii) the Declaration of
Trust of the Series A Trust (the
"Original Series A Declaration"), dated as

the Remarketing Agreement, a "Securities
Agreement").
 
      The
Company hereby confirms its engagement of Banc of America
Securities
LLC ("BAS") as, and BAS hereby confirms its
agreement with the Company to render
services as, a "qualified independent
underwriter", within the meaning of
Section (b)(15) of Rule 2720 of the NASD,
Inc. (the "NASD") with respect to the
offering and sale of the Securities. BAS,
solely in its capacity as the
qualified independent underwriter and not
otherwise, is referred to herein as
the "QIU". The price at which the
Securities will be sold to the public shall
not be higher than the maximum price
recommended by the QIU.
 
      Particular
sales of Securities may be made from time to time to the
Underwriters of such Securities, for whom
the firms designated as
representatives of the Underwriters of such
Securities in the Pricing Agreement
relating thereto will act as
representatives (the "Representatives"). The term
"Representatives" also refers to a single
firm acting as sole

<PAGE>
representative of the Underwriters and to
Underwriters who act without any firm
being designated as their representative.
This Underwriting Agreement shall not
be construed as an obligation of the
Company to sell any of the Securities or as
an obligation of any of the Underwriters to
purchase the Securities. The
obligation of the Company to issue and sell
any of the Securities and the
obligation of any of the Underwriters to
purchase any of the Securities shall be
evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with
respect to the Securities specified
therein.
 
      Each
Pricing Agreement shall specify the total number of units of
Securities that are the subject of such
Pricing Agreement, the initial public
offering price of such Securities, the
purchase price to the Underwriters of
such Securities, the names of the
Underwriters of such Securities, the names of
the Representatives of such Underwriters
and the total number of units of the
Securities to be purchased by each
Underwriter. In addition, such Pricing
Agreement shall set forth the date, time
and manner of delivery of such
Securities and payment therefor. Such
Pricing Agreement shall also specify (in a
manner not inconsistent with the applicable
Securities Agreements and the
registration statement and prospectus with
respect thereto) the terms of such
Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in
the form of an executed writing
(which may be in counterparts), and may be
evidenced by an exchange of
telegraphic communications or any other
rapid transmission device designed to
produce a written record of communications
transmitted. The obligations of the
Underwriters under this Agreement and each
Pricing Agreement shall be several
and not joint.
 
      1.
Representations and Warranties. Each of the Issuers, jointly
and
severally, represents and warrants to the
Underwriters as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date (as hereinafter
defined), and agrees with each of the
Underwriters, as follows:
 
      (a) The
Issuers have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "Commission") a registration statement
on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-124358,
333-124358-01 and 333-124358-02) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"), which has become effective,
for the registration under the Act of
the Securities (including the Component
Securities). The Company meets the
requirements for use of Form S-3 under the
Act. No stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the registration statement
has been issued under the Act and no
proceedings for that purpose have been
instituted or are pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, are contemplated
by the Commission, and any request on
the part of the Commission for additional
information has been complied with.
The Issuers propose to file with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the
Act a supplement or supplements to the form
of prospectus included in such
registration statement relating to the
Securities (including the Component
Securities) and the plan of distribution
thereof. Such registration statement,
including the exhibits thereto, as amended
at the date of this Agreement, is
hereinafter called the "Registration
Statement"; such prospectus in the form in
which it appears in the Registration
Statement is hereinafter called the "Base
Prospectus"; and such supplemented form of
prospectus, in the form in which it
shall first be filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424 (including the
Base Prospectus as so supplemented), is
hereinafter called the "Final
Prospectus." Any preliminary form of the
Final Prospectus which has heretofore
