      Homer City Generating Station Operated by NRG Energy Services
    



Providing safe, efficient operations and maintenance services for one 
      of the largest power plants in the United States






February 07, 2013 05:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NRG Energy Services, through its Homer City Services company, has taken 
      over all operating and maintenance responsibilities at the three unit, 
      1,884 megawatt (MW) Homer City Generating Station under a long-term 
      operating agreement with the plant’s owner. NRG Energy Services is a 
      wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG).
    


      “With NRG’s extensive experience owning, operating and maintaining power 
      plants including fossil fuel, nuclear and renewable facilities, we 
      understand what it takes to run a plant smoothly, safely and 
      efficiently,” said Don Poe, President of NRG Energy Services. “By 
      leveraging our operational experience and capabilities, we are able to 
      deliver valuable services to the Homer City plant and clearly 
      demonstrate NRG Energy Services’ commitment to quality, successful 
      third-party operations.”
    

      NRG Energy Services was formed to deliver a uniquely capable service to 
      companies that want to match their plants with the expertise of a 
      premiere operating company. Energy Services bring skills and experience 
      acquired as part of the team operating and supporting the largest 
      competitive power generator in the United States with approximately 
      47,000 MW of generation.
    

      “As an O&M service provider, NRG Energy Services focuses on bringing an 
      operation model that drives improvements in plant reliability and 
      availability,” added Poe. “We deliver custom-tailored O&M solutions that 
      address asset optimization for today’s market conditions.”
    

      In addition to providing exemplary operating and management services, 
      NRG Energy Services offers maintenance services that provide major 
      maintenance to solar, wind, coal, gas and nuclear operations as well as 
      state-of-the-art in-house repair shops located in Texas, Louisiana, 
      Maryland and Pennsylvania with specialized equipment to restore plant 
      equipment back online safely and efficiently.
    

      NRG Energy Services took over operation of the western Pennsylvania 
      Homer City Generating Station – owned by an affiliate of GE Energy 
      Financial Services and a minority investor – from its previous operator, 
      an affiliate of Edison Mission Energy.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
