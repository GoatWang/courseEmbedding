First Trust To Launch The First Trust TCW Opportunistic Fixed Income ETF






Business Wire




Feb 14, 2017 4:21 PM EST













 


















































  First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust"), a leading ETF provider and asset manager, announced today that it expects to launch a new actively managed exchange-traded fund ("ETF") on February 15, 2017, that is designed to give investors exposure primarily to investment grade bonds. The First Trust TCW Opportunistic Fixed Income ETF (Nasdaq: FIXD) (the "fund") seeks to maximize long-term total return using a value driven approach. The fund is sub-advised and managed by TCW Investment Management Company LLC ("TCW" or "Sub-Advisor").  The fund is a multi-sector portfolio that provides exposure to core and satellite fixed income assets. Under normal market conditions, the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in fixed income securities of any credit quality and may invest up to 35% of its net assets in securities rated below investment grade. "TCW takes a very careful and deliberate approach to new product development, and we could not be more pleased to launch this fund with an industry-leading partner like First Trust," said Steve Kane, Portfolio Manager at TCW. "Given the increased market demand for actively managed fixed income ETFs, we believe this offering will provide another means for investors to access our team-based, value approach to managing fixed income portfolios." Unlike passive indexing strategies, TCW's active approach focuses on generating alpha primarily through sector allocation and security selection. The investment process comprises additional strategies including careful duration management, yield curve positioning and opportunistic trade execution. The result is a portfolio that is diversified not only in a traditional sense across maturities, sectors and securities, but also across strategies that provide the opportunity to seek higher risk-adjusted returns.  TCW's fixed income management philosophy reflects a goal of consistently outperforming the broader bond market over full market cycles while maintaining below average volatility with an emphasis on capital preservation, particularly in rising interest rate environments. "We believe fixed income markets provide significant opportunities for active managers to add value," said Ryan Issakainen, CFA, Senior Vice President and ETF Strategist for First Trust. "TCW is a world class institutional investment manager, and we're thrilled to offer this core, fixed-income ETF."

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

(“First Trust”), a leading ETF provider and asset manager, announced today that it expects to launch a new actively managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) on February 15, 2017, that is designed to give investors exposure primarily to investment grade bonds. The First Trust TCW Opportunistic Fixed Income ETF (Nasdaq: FIXD) (the “fund”) seeks to maximize long-term total return using a value driven approach. The fund is sub-advised and managed by TCW Investment Management Company LLC (“TCW” or “Sub-Advisor”).The fund is a multi-sector portfolio that provides exposure to core and satellite fixed income assets. Under normal market conditions, the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in fixed income securities of any credit quality and may invest up to 35% of its net assets in securities rated below investment grade. “TCW takes a very careful and deliberate approach to new product development, and we could not be more pleased to launch this fund with an industry-leading partner like First Trust,” said Steve Kane, Portfolio Manager at TCW. “Given the increased market demand for actively managed fixed income ETFs, we believe this offering will provide another means for investors to access our team-based, value approach to managing fixed income portfolios.” Unlike passive indexing strategies, TCW’s active approach focuses on generating alpha primarily through sector allocation and security selection. The investment process comprises additional strategies including careful duration management, yield curve positioning and opportunistic trade execution. The result is a portfolio that is diversified not only in a traditional sense across maturities, sectors and securities, but also across strategies that provide the opportunity to seek higher risk-adjusted returns.TCW’s fixed income management philosophy reflects a goal of consistently outperforming the broader bond market over full market cycles while maintaining below average volatility with an emphasis on capital preservation, particularly in rising interest rate environments. “We believe fixed income markets provide significant opportunities for active managers to add value,” said Ryan Issakainen, CFA, Senior Vice President and ETF Strategist for First Trust. “TCW is a world class institutional investment manager, and we’re thrilled to offer this core, fixed-income ETF.”The fund’s portfolio management team from TCW includes Tad Rivelle, Chief Investment Officer, Co-Director – Fixed Income, Portfolio Manager; Laird Landmann, Co-Director – Fixed Income, Portfolio Manager; Stephen M. Kane, CFA, Portfolio Manager; and Bryan T. Whalen, CFA, Portfolio Manager. The portfolio managers are jointly responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund.For more information about First Trust, please contact Ryan Issakainen of First Trust at (630) 765-8689 or RIssakainen@FTAdvisors.com.About First TrustFirst Trust Advisors L.P., along with its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately held companies which provide a variety of investment services, including asset management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $100 billion as of January 31, 2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.

The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.ETF CharacteristicsThe fund will list and principally trade its shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share’s net asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.Risk ConsiderationsThe fund’s shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund, fund shares or securities in general may fall in value.The fund is subject to credit risk, call risk, income risk, interest rate risk and prepayment risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk is heightened for the floating rate loans in which the fund invests because companies that issue such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy. Call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by the fund, performance could be adversely impacted. Income risk is the risk that income from the fund’s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in the fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected. This may result in a decline in the fund’s income.Certain of the fixed-income securities in the fund may not have the benefit of covenants which could reduce the ability of the issuer to meet its payment obligations and might result in increased credit risk.High-yield securities, or “junk” bonds, are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings, and therefore, may be highly speculative. These securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history, narrowly focused operations, and/or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity. Lower quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher quality debt.The risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of high-yield fixed income instruments. The loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated. Upon a prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced. The fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.Mortgage-related securities, including mortgage-backed securities, are more susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory events that affect the value of real estate. Mortgage-related securities are subject to the risk that the rate of mortgage prepayments decreases, which extends the average life of a security and increases the interest rate exposure.In a falling inflationary environment, both interest payments and the value of Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) will decline.Securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and U.S. government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) carry additional risks, including, the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments, the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default, the possibility that the investments in CLOs are subordinate to other classes or tranches, and the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results.The use of options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when the fund’s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance the fund’s returns or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by the fund.If a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations, the fund will lose money and the value of an investment in fund shares may decrease.As the use of Internet technology has become more prevalent in the course of business, the fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks through breaches in cyber security.Non-U.S. securities are subject to higher volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political, social or economic developments; restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of securities; lack of liquidity; currency exchange rates; excessive taxation; government seizure of assets; different legal or accounting standards and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries. These risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. Changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the fund’s investment and the value of fund shares. Because the fund’s net asset value is determined on the basis of U.S. dollars, you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.Investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and/or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.Illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books.The fund is classified as “non-diversified” and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.The fund’s creation units will generally be issued and redeemed for cash and, in certain circumstances, in-kind for securities in which the fund invests. As a result, the fund may be less tax efficient.The fund currently has fewer assets than larger, more established funds, and like other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the fund’s market exposure for limited periods of time.The fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing the fund’s investment portfolio, the sub-advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. There can be no guarantee that the fund will meet its investment objectives.First Trust Advisors L.P. is the adviser to the fund. First Trust Advisors L.P. is an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., the fund’s distributor.Definitions:Alpha is an indication of how much an investment outperforms or underperforms on a risk-adjusted basis relative to its benchmark.Duration is a measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield. It accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170214006441/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredMattress Startup Purple Agrees to $1.1B Merger With Publicly-Traded Investment Shell CompanyForbesAnthony Scaramucci’s Hollywood Ties: Investments Include Movie ‘Crazy for the Boys’VarietySecond-Quarter U.S. Growth Rate of 2.6% Underscores ResilienceBloombergHuman Barbie Takes Off Make Up, Drs Are SpeechlessKiwi ReportSponsoredWisconsin governor defends $3 billion deal for Foxconn plantReutersTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderWhat's the Problem with Joel Osteen?ChurchLeaders.comSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekCardiologist: 3 Foods You Should Quit ImmediatelyGundry MDSponsoredTrump names John F.

2 Performance as of 06/30/2017 (updated monthly)
                    

3 Returns include the performance of the predecessor limited partnership for periods 
                        before the Fund’s registration became effective. The predecessor limited partnership 
                        was not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“1940 Act”) and 
                        therefore was not subject to certain investment restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act. 
                        If the limited partnership had been registered under the 1940 Act, its performance 
                        may have been adversely affected.

Investment Objective
The Total Return Bond Fund seeks to maximize long-term total return. 
Investment Approach
The Fund pursues its objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets in investment grade fixed income securities or unrated securities that are determined by the Adviser to be of similar quality. Up to 20% of the Fund’s net assets may be invested in securities rated below investment grade. The Fund also invests at least 80% of its net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes in fixed income securities it regards as bonds. Under normal conditions, the portfolio duration is two to eight years and the dollar-weighted average maturity ranges from two to fifteen years. The Fund invests in the U.S. and abroad, including emerging markets, and may purchase securities of varying maturities issued by domestic and foreign corporations and governments. The Adviser will concentrate the Fund’s portfolio holdings in areas of the bond market (based on quality, sector, coupon or maturity) that the Adviser believes to be relatively undervalued. 
Investments include various types of bonds and other securities, typically corporate bonds, notes, collateralized bond obligations, collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related and asset-backed securities, bank loans, money-market securities, swaps, futures, municipal sercurities, options, credit default swaps, private placements and restricted securities. These investments may have interest rates that are fixed, variable or floating. 
Derivatives will be used in an effort to hedge investments, for risk management, or to increase income or gains for the Fund. The Fund may also seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques.

Morningstar Analyst Rating Disclosure: The Morningstar Analyst Rating is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of Morningstar, Inc. Morningstar evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. Morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. Analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weighting of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating ultimately reflects the analyst’s overall assessment and is overseen by Morningstar’s Analyst Rating Committee. The approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across Morningstar’s global coverage universe. The Analyst Rating scale ranges from Gold to Negative, with Gold being the highest rating and Negative being the lowest rating. A fund with a “Gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction. A fund with a ‘Silver’ rating has notable advantages across several, but perhaps not all, of the five pillars-strengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction. A “Bronze”-rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars, with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating. A fund with a ‘Neutral’ rating isn’t seriously flawed across the five pillars, nor does it distinguish itself very positively. A “Negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers. Analyst Ratings are reevaluated at least every 14 months. The Morningstar Analyst Rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund. Morningstar Analyst Ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected.Morningstar Rating Disclosure: The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.The total number of Intermediate-Term Bond Funds for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year time periods were 856, 767, and 540, respectively. The MetWest Total Return Bond Fund I Share received a rating of 3 stars for the 3-year period, and 5 stars for the 5- and 10-year periods. The MetWest Total Return Bond Fund M Share received a rating of 3 stars for the 3-year period, 4 stars for the 5-year period, and 5 stars for the 10-year period. The MetWest Total Return Bond Fund P Share received a rating of 3 stars for the 3-year period, and 5 stars for the 5-year period. The TCW Total Return Bond Fund I Share received a rating of 3 stars for the 3-year period, and 5 stars for the 5- and 10-year periods. The TCW Total Return Bond Fund N Share received a rating of 2 stars for the 3-year period, and 5 stars for the 5- and 10-year periods. The TCW Core Fixed Income Fund I Share received a rating of 3 stars for the 3- and 5-year periods, and 5 stars for the 10-year period. The TCW Core Fixed Income Fund N Share received a rating of 2 stars for the 3- and 5-year periods, and 5 stars for the 10-year period.It is important to note that the Fund is not guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk, the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk, and price volatility risk. Funds investing in bonds can lose their value as interest rates rise and an investor can lose principal.Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than risks associated with other types of debt instruments. MBS related to floating rate loans may exhibit greater price volatility than a fixed rate obligation of similar credit quality. With respect to non-agency MBS, there are no direct or indirect government or agency guarantees of payments in pools created by non-governmental issuers. Non-agency MBS are also not subject to the same underwriting requirements for the underlying mortgages that are applicable to those mortgage-related securities that have a government or government-sponsored entity guarantee.Obtain a ProspectusYou should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing.
