Larry Weber
Chairman & Founder





Larry is a globally known expert on public relations and marketing services who founded multiple successful public relations and interactive marketing agencies, authored five forward-thinking marketing books and co-founded the largest interactive advocacy organization in the world.
Larry is recognized as a thought leader on how software, the Internet and digital technologies have created seismic shifts in the practice of marketing that deliver entirely new levels of customer engagement. Today, Larry’s focus is on how this marriage of technology and marketing has created a powerful platform for authentic marketing across paid, earned and owned channels, further advancing the evolution of the discipline.
Larry helps both multi-national and emerging companies harness authentic marketing strategies – including reinventing themselves around this new form of good – to create powerhouse brands. Among the companies Larry has counseled are: ARM, AT&T, Boston Scientific, Coca-Cola, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, John Deere, Kaiser Permanente, Microsoft, PTC, Pittsburgh Steelers, SAP and Verizon Wireless.
In 1987, Larry started his own public relations company, The Weber Group, which within a decade became the world’s largest public relations firm. The Interpublic Group of Companies purchased The Weber Group in late 1996, and in early 2000, Larry was named chairman and CEO of Interpublic’s Advanced Marketing Services, a $3 billion unit with 12,000 people, and included the company’s public relations, research and analytics and entertainment holdings.
Larry serves on a number of boards of corporations, non-profits and academic institutions. He is the Co-founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX). He also serves of the Board of Directors for Pegasystems, Inc. (PEGA) in Cambridge, Mass. and Macromill Group (TYO:3730) in Japan. He is a guest lecturer at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. In 2013, Larry was a speaker and a member of Oxford’s winning 2013 Union Debate team at the annual Silicon Valley Comes to Oxford.
Larry has authored five business/marketing books, including The Provocateur: How a New Generation of Leaders Are Building Communities, Not Just Companies (Random House/Crown Business, 2002), business bestseller Marketing to the Social Web: How Digital Customer Communities Build Your Business (Wiley & Sons, 2007, second edition, 2009), Sticks & Stones: How Digital Business Reputations Are Created Over Time…and Lost in a Click (Wiley & Sons, 2009), Everywhere: Comprehensive Digital Business Strategy for the Social Media Era (Wiley & Sons, 2001) and The Digital Marketer (Wiley & Sons, 2014).

THE BEST BBQ MEMORIES ARE MADE BY SHARING WONDERFUL MEALS

Inspired by his passion for grilling the best steaks for family and friends, Weber’s founder, George Stephen, invented the revolutionary kettle grill in 1952.
George knew that a rounded cooking bowl with a lid was the key to success. He added three legs to the bottom, a handle to the top, and the rest is history.

Career[edit]
Weber started his own public relations company, The Weber Group, in 1987 and shortly after launched Thunderhouse, one of the first interactive marketing firms. The Weber Group was unique in its focus on technology and its location in Cambridge, Massachusetts, an area soon to become the interactive capital of the world. Within 10 years, The Weber Group was the world’s largest and most established technology public relations firm.
The Interpublic Group of Companies purchased The Weber Group in late 1996, and in early 2000, Weber was named chairman and CEO of Interpublic's Advanced Marketing Services group, a $3 billion unit including the company's public relations, research and analysis, and entertainment holdings. In the summer of 2001, Weber engineered the merger of Weber Shandwick Worldwide and BSMG Worldwide to form the world's largest public relations firm. In early 2004, he decided to return to his entrepreneurial roots and founded Racepoint Global.
Over his 30-year career, Weber has counseled many of the world’s leading brands on marketing and business strategy including AT&T, Coca-Cola, Cook Medical, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, Kaiser Permanente, Microsoft, Samsung and many more. He has also led the marketing of new and disruptive technologies such as HTML and the XO laptop by One Laptop per Child, a nonprofit whose mission is to bring access to a modern education to children in third world countries and acts as advisor to multiple emerging technology companies.
Most recently, Weber has been working closely with leading silicon clients supporting global campaigns for brands including ARM, Atmel, AppliedMicro, Silicon Image, Marvell Semiconductor, Spansion, Global Foundries, Fairchild Semiconductor and more. Racepoint Global continues to transform and accelerate technology innovators across Silicon Valley.
He hosts Internet radio show Market Edge with Larry Weber on WebmasterRadio.fm. Family: He has three kids, all in or out of college. Larry also makes a mean chicken dinner.

He is preceded in death by 2 children: Lucinda (’70) and Robert (July 8, 1997). Larry is also preceded in death by his brother Judson Weber, 2 sisters-in-law, and 4 brothers-in-law. Carol Weber (wife of Bud Weber), Sharon Weber (wife of Mike Weber), Hobart Gray (husband of Dolly Gray), Marty Ellison (brother of Mary Ellison Weber), Johnny Shoup (brother-in-law of Mary Ellison Weber), and Mark Cameron (brother of Mary Ellison Weber). Floyd Turtle, a special friend to Larry, also preceded him in death.
Larry proudly served his country through the United States Army. He served a total of 6 years, including 18 months in country, during the Vietnam War. He continued his service to the veteran community by becoming a Life Member of VFW Post 4342 in Kahoka, MO. He served as Quarter Master for 12 years and spent countless hours volunteering at the post. Many of those hours were spent utilizing his construction skills and improving the facilities to ensure that the VFW was a safe and inviting establishment for veterans and their families.
Throughout his life, Larry worked construction as well as driving a semi. One of the things he enjoyed most was running heavy equipment (cranes, bulldozers, track hoes, etc.). Often times he was lucky enough to work on the jobs with his sons by his side. Robert worked next to him up until the day he died. Most recently, he happily worked with Michael and Keith Phillips at Phillips Farms. Although he helped with everything, he was most often found running and working on heavy equipment.
In his spare time, he loved to do wood working projects, often building furniture pieces for his children. Larry also loved the mountains and enjoyed traveling to Colorado to visit his cousins, Walt and Maggie Perkins. He and Mary also made several trips to southern Missouri to visit family and friends. The most important thing to Larry was his family
There will be a Celebration of Life on June 14, 2017 at the Kahoka C.A.R.E. Building. The family will receive guests from 10-12. Everyone will be invited to write down stories about Larry that will be read by family members at noon. With Larry there was rarely a dull moment, so we are hoping for many funny antics to be told. Lunch will follow after the readings.
Memorials can be given to:

Hospice of Northeast Missouri
Camp Vallor

Larry and his family would also greatly appreciate continued support for the VFW.
