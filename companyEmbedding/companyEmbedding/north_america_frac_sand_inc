North America Frac Sand Inc. Announces Acquisition 



















North America Frac Sand Inc. Announces Acquisition 


 

 


Details


Published: Thursday, 22 October 2015 16:58 














North America Frac Sand Inc. announced the acquisition of North America Frac Sand (CA) Ltd. and its 30,000 acres of leases that are estimated to contain 6.4 million tons of recoverable reserves of frac sand, and potential reserves of at least 66 million tons.
The three challenges of discovering new frac sand reserves are:

Meeting all of the API specification with respect to size and shape of the frac sand deposits. “Our frac sand deposit contain the three most common sizes 20-40,30-50, 40-70 & 70-140 all of which meet API standards,” the company said.
Sufficient contiguous volume and value to be economical. “Our frac sand deposit is both of sufficient volume and quality to be economic. We have minimum overburden; we have our mining permits; we are ready to continue to prove up our resource, build our plant, and start shipping,” the company continued.
Are in close proximity to either, oil and natural gas reservoirs, or at least to rail, for cost efficient transportation. “We are truck-able distance to the major Bakken reservoir in North Dakota, Montana, Alberta and Saskatchewan; as well as the Duvernay, Horn River, Montney, Viking and Cardium reservoirs of Western Canada. Annual requirements are in the millions of tons for new drilling and recompletions,” the company added.

“We are strategically located to replace a significant portion of the 70 percent of the frac sand currently being imported into Canada from Wisconsin,” the company concluded. “By trucking directly to our customers, not only do we save 1,500 km shipping costs, we by-pass the current bottlenecks of the supply chain, which are rail car availability; lack of trans-loading facilities and sand storage infrastructure; and improving last mile deliveries. Additionally, in this short-term period of low price oil, we provide a cost efficient solution to deliver the frac sand exactly when and where the drillers require the frac sand.” Tags:  North America Frac Sand Inc.

	Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.






	 


	This report on Form 10-Q of North America Frac Sand, Inc. for the period ended March 31, 2017 contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward looking statements which, by definition involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements under the Sections; Description of Business, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements. Where in any forward looking statements, the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.


	 


	The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal proceedings.


	 


	You should not rely on forward looking statements in this annual report. This annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “future,” “intends,” and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

	North America Frac Sand, Inc.





	Notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements




	March 31, 2017





	 



	NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS



	 



	ORGANIZATION



	 


	The Company is Florida Corporation which was incorporated on April 26, 2007. The Company was formed as New Found Shrimp, Inc. to provide consultation to the aquatic farming industry. It was the Company’s plan to provide consolidation opportunities for on-going and start up aquatic farming operations. The Company’s approach was to be to assist aquatic farming operations with the organizational structure, customer service and marketing aspects of their business, allowing our customers to focus on the business aspects of operating the farms. On April 25, 2014, the Company changed its name to Xterra Building Systems, Inc. On July 10, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Canadian Sandtech Inc. to acquire its wholly owned subsidiary, North America Frac Sand (CA) Ltd. (“NAFS-CA”). In accordance with this Share Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 37,800,000 shares of common stock and placed these shares in escrow. On September 17, 2015, the Company changed its name to North America Frac Sand, Inc. On August 29, 2016, all subjects were removed by the Company to close on the acquisition of NAFS-CA. NAFS-CA has approximately 30,000 acres of mineral leases located approximately 30 kilometers east of Saskatoon Saskatchewan.


	 


	The Company is now headquartered in North Vancouver, British Columbia.


	 



	NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN



	 


	The Company has a history of losses, including $51,214 and $72,724 the periods ending March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Losses result in an accumulated deficit of $36,230,266. The Company has negative working capital of $625,145 and $573,931 as at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 respectively. The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.


	 


	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern

	The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	CASH


	AND CASH EQUIVALENTS



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $Nil at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

	NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)



	 



	CASH


	FLOWS REPORTING



	 


	The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period.


	 



	INTANGIBLE ASSETS



	 


	The Company has applied the provisions of ASC topic 350 – Intangible – goodwill and other, in accounting for its intangible assets. Intangible assets are being amortized by straight-line method on the basis of a useful life of 3 years, to begin upon the operational commencement. Intangible assets consist of website development cost. The balance at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $-0- and $-0-, respectively.


	 



	IMPAIRMENT OF LONG- LIVED ASSETS



	 


	The Company reviews and evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The assets are subject to impairment consideration under FASB ASC 360-10-35-17 if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. When the Company determines that an impairment analysis should be done, the analysis will be performed using the rules of FASB ASC 930-360-35, Asset Impairment, and 360-0 through 15-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long- Lived Assets.


	 



	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



	 


	The Company’s balance sheet includes financial instruments, specifically accounts payable, accrued expenses, and payables to related parties. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.


	 


	ASC 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:


	 







	 




	·



	Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities





	 




	·



	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.





	 




	·



	Level 3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

	NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)



	 


	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of March 31, 2017. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.


	 



	REVENUE RECOGNITION



	 


	The Company follows ASC 605, Revenue Recognition -The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has not generated any revenues for the periods presented.


	 



	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT



	 


	The Company expenses research and development costs when incurred. Research and development costs include engineering and testing of product and outputs. Indirect costs related to research and developments are allocated based on percentage usage to the research and development. We spent $-0- in research and development costs for the periods March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 



	DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND VALUATION ALLOWANCE



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740

	Income Taxes

	. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of March 31, 2017, or December 31, 2015.


	 



	NET


	INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE



	 


	Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share.” The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised.


	 


	Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at March 31, 2017 and at December 31, 2015. The Series B Preferred stock can be converted to common shares at a rate determined by the Board of Directors.


	 



	SHARE-BASED EXPENSE



	 


	ASC 718,

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).


	 


	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50,

	Equity – Based Payments to Non-Employees.

	Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued.




	 


	Share-based expense for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $-0- and $-0-, respectively.

	NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)



	  



	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



	 


	In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12

	Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.

	A performance target in a share-based payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be accounted for as a performance condition under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718,

	Compensation — Stock Compensation

	. As a result, the target is not reflected in the estimation of the award’s grant date fair value. Compensation cost would be recognized over the required service period, if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2015 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Management has reviewed the ASU and believes that they currently account for these awards in a manner consistent with the new guidance, therefore there is no anticipation of any effect to the consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15

	Preparation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.

	Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), continuation of a reporting entity as a going concern is presumed as the basis for preparing financial statements unless and until the entity’s liquidation becomes imminent. Preparation of financial statements under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. If and when an entity’s liquidation becomes imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30,

	Presentation of Financial Statements—Liquidation Basis of Accounting

	. Even when an entity’s liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. In those situations, financial statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern basis of accounting, but the amendments in this Update should be followed to determine whether to disclose information about the relevant conditions and events. The amendments in this Update are effective for the year ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company will evaluate the going concern considerations in this ASU, however, at the current period, management does not believe that it has met conditions which would subject these financial statements for additional disclosure.


	 


	We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation’s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.

	Up-front payment of $3,000. Ten-year lease dated July 17, 2015, automatically extended for second 10 years if royalties are being paid. Lease rate is $1 per acre per year. Royalty rate is $5.00 per ton of processed ore sold at $80 per metric ton or less, and $5.00 plus the 10% of the difference between sales price greater than $80 and $80 per metric ton.

	Prior to acquisition, the leases have been explored through extensive drilling operations. As there has not been an economic evaluation of the mineral leases, the investment in the mineral leases have been expensed as Impairment of mineral leases of $1,539,430. On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Northwest Corporation to undertake exploration activities and to prepare an economic evaluation through the preparation NI43-101 report on the mineral leases. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had expended approximately $69,485. As these expenditures were undertaken prior to the effective date of the transaction, they have not been incorporated into the consolidated financial statements.

	NOTE 5. INCOME TAXES



	 


	At March 31, 2017, the Company had a net operating loss carry–forward for Federal income tax purposes of $677,787 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2032. No tax benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards in the accompanying financial statements because the Company believes that the realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets of $230,448, calculated at an effective tax rate of 34%, was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are fully offset by a valuation allowance of $230,448.

	NOTE 6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY



	 



	COMMON STOCK





	 


	On September 17, 2014, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation. The Company has been authorized to issue 10,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.00001 par value. Each share of issued and outstanding common stock shall entitle the holder thereof to fully participate in all shareholder meetings, to cast one vote on each matter with respect to which shareholders have the right to vote, and to share ratably in all dividends and other distributions declared and paid with respect to common stock, as well as in the net assets of the corporation upon liquidation or dissolution.

	PREFERRED STOCK





	 


	On September 17, 2014, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation. The Company has been authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of $0.00001 par value Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is expressly vested with the authority to divide any or all of the Preferred Stock into series and to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of the shares of each series so established, within certain guidelines established in the Articles of Incorporation. On July 28, 2016, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation reducing the authorization to issue 1,000,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares of $0.00001 par value Preferred Stock.


	 


	Series A: 1 share of preferred stock has been designated as Series A. The certificate of designations for the Preferred A Stock provides that it may only be issued in exchange for the partial or full retirement of debt held by management, employees or consultants, or as directed by a majority vote of the Board of Directors. Whereas the September 17, 2014 amendment enabled the Series A may be convertible into the number of shares of common stock which equals four times the sum of (i) the total number of shares of common stock which are issued and outstanding at the time of conversion, plus (ii) the total number of shares of Series B and Series C preferred stocks which are issued and outstanding at the time of conversion; the July 28, 2016 amendment eliminated all conversion rights associated with this class of stock. The Series A class possesses a number of votes equal to the number of common stock equivalents, if converted.


	 


	Series B: 99,999,999 shares of preferred stock have been designated as Series B. This is a reduction from the 999,999,990 shares of preferred stock previously designated as Series B. The certificate of designation for the Preferred B Stock provides that as a class shall be entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion. Preferred Series B will have liquidation rites, an amount equal to $1.00 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends for each share held. Each share will have 10 votes. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible into common shares, at any time, and/or from time to time, into the number of shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, equal to the price of the Series B Preferred Stock, divided by the par value of the Common Stock, subject to adjustment as may be determined by the Board of Directors from time to time (the “Conversion Rate”).


	 


	The September 17, 2014 amended to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation modified the terms of the Preferred Series A conversion exchange to common stock. Because of this modification, the Company did not have sufficient common shares to settle both the Preferred Series A and Preferred Series B share conversions. Consequently, the requirement for extinguishment accounting was triggered. Under the terms of extinguishment accounting, the Company is required to determine a fair value the Preferred Series A. SEC guidelines request that the Company use fair value as determined by an arm’s length transaction with an unrelated third party and that there are no unstated rights or privileges. The Preferred Series A was deemed to have a fair value of $13,741,679 based upon the converted valuation approach as the primary driver of value in the instrument, its common stock equivalency. The Preferred Series A were to be classified as mezzanine equity. On July 28, 2016, the Company eliminated the rights of the Preferred Series A to convert into common stock. Consequently, the requirement for extinguishment accounting has been removed.


	 


	As a result of the July 28, 2016 amendment, the Company now has sufficient shares to settle Preferred Series A and Preferred Series B and accordingly has reclassed the share to permanent equity from mezzanine equity.


	 


	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 there was 1 share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.


	 


	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 there were 93 and 103 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, respectively.


	 



	OPTIONS AND WARRANTS



	 


	There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional shares of common stock of the Company.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations




	 



	The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report

	.

	The management’s discussion, analysis of financial condition, and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this prospectus.



	 



	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	North America Frac Sand, Inc. is a Florida corporation, (the "Company"). The Company’s name, as incorporated, was New Found Shrimp, Inc. The Company has been providing marketing of consulting services primarily to independent aquatic farming operators and other market participants located in the Midwest of the United States of America (the “U.S.”). Historically, we conducted initial marketing and sales activities to take advantage of opportunities related to time, location and quality of aquatic farming operations. We have conducted our operations primarily in Indiana.


	 


	We were founded in April 2007 in Indianapolis, Indiana. In June of 2012 we changed our domicile from the state of Indiana to the State of Florida. On February 9, 2015 David Copp resigned as CEO and Director, and David Alexander has been appointed CEO and President.


	 


	In 2014, we reviewed opportunities in the modular building systems markets in Alberta, Canada. At that time, we changed our name, from New Found Shrimp Inc., to Innovate Building Systems Inc, and subsequently to Xterra Building Systems Inc. On July 10, 2015, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Canadian Sandtech Inc. (“CSI”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of North America Frac Sand (CA) Ltd. (“NAFS-CA”) by issuing to CSI 37,800,000 shares of the Company into escrow. At that time, we changed our name from Xterra Building Systems to North America Frac Sand Inc.


	 


	NAFS-CA was incorporated in Alberta on June 8, 2015 and was a wholly owned subsidiary of CSI. NAFS-CA owns approximately 30,000 acres of mineral leases about 30 kilometers east of Saskatchewan, Canada, called the Eagle Creek leases. On August 29, 2016 these leases were assigned to the Company.


	 


	A description of the Eagle Creek mineral leases is as follows:

	Up front payment of $3,000. Ten-year lease dated July 17, 2015, automatically extended for second 10 years if royalties are being paid. Lease rate is $1 per acre per year. Royalty rate is $5.00 per ton of processed ore sold at $80 per metric ton or less, and $5.00 plus the 10% of the difference between sales price greater than $80 and $80 per metric ton.

	There has been significant exploration activity on 1,680 acres of the Eagle Creek property. Since 2008, CSI has drilled 173 holes on the Eagle Creek property. 149 of the drill holes were 300-foot spacing. 7 drill holes and 17 backhoe holes were 600-foot spacing. The average sand thickness per hole was 10.5 feet and the size of the tested area was approximately 12.9 million square feet. With respect to frac sand, there are approximately 75 lbs. of frac sand per cubic foot. CSI transferred ownership of the Eagle Creek property to its wholly owned subsidiary NAFS-CA in early August 2015. A summary of the activities undertaken on the property to date is as follows:

	CSI recognized the sand qualities on the leased property and the fact that these sands warranted further testing. This lead to CSI entering into lease agreements.






	Jun 2009






	 




	CSI tested 107 holes backhoed under the supervision of Independent Engineer Green Engineering Ltd. ("GEL) and determined that significant quantities of suitable sand were present and that additional testing from an Independent engineer was required.






	Nov-Dec 2009






	 




	CSI core drilled 66 holes under the supervision of Independent Engineer GEL and began lab testing of core samples.






	June 2010






	 




	Saskatchewan Government confirmed CSI’s sand deposit (frac sands) fall under “Sand and Gravel” and are the property of the surface right holder. No disposition under the Quarry Regulations, 1957 was required to exploit the frac sand deposit.






	Nov 2010 – Jan 2013






	 




	Further laboratory testing was conducted by SGS & Met Solve Labs and results determined the sands tested passed American Petroleum Industry (API) standards.






	Jan 2013 - Current






	 




	CSI began gathering production data, plant design and cost, financial data and compiled other data to assist in the preparation of a NI 43-101 report required for additional financing.






	 


	Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise approximately $2 million in capital financing. The proceeds of this financing would first be used to complete a NI-43-101 report. If recommended to by the NI-43-101 report, it is our intention to continue to drill out the property, to establish the both the size and quality of the frac sand resource evident on the mineral leases, and to provide working capital to the Company. The Company has continued to borrow funds from its management. With some of these funds the Company has entered into a loan agreement with NAFS-CA, utilizing the mining leases as collateral for any advances made by the Company. As a consequence of this arrangement, NAFS-CA has been able to retain Northwest Corporation, a Calgary based mineral engineering company, to conduct certain development work on the mineral leases for the purpose of determining the presence of and economic resource and completing a NI-43-101 Report, as well as to pay the annual minimum lease payments on the mineral leases and thereby keep mineral leases in good standing. The field work initially was to compile previously completed mineral testing results and to write an NI-43-101 Report based on this data. However, the integrity of the data obtained was such that additional development work was required. This work includes an Auger Drilling Field Program, as well as additional assay and other tests, are currently underway


	 


	Although we are not presently engaged in any other capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offerings of our company’s securities. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct a private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.


	 


	The implementation of our business strategy is estimated to take approximately 12 months. Once we are able to secure funding, implementation will begin immediately. The major parts of the strategy to be immediately implemented will be the sales and marketing and office equipment and human resource procurement.

	Liquidity



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.


	 


	The Company sustained a loss for the period ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 of $51,214 and $66,972, respectively. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $36,230,266. Because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations, the Company will require additional funding for continuing the development and marketing. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 


	We are presently not able to meet our obligations as they come due. At March 31, 2017 we had working capital deficit of $625,145. Our working capital deficit is due to the results of operations.


	 


	Net cash used in operating activities for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4,465 and $10,702, respectively.


	 


	Net cash provided by financing activities for the periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4,465 and $10,702, respectively.


	 


	We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company’s securities after the completion of this offering. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See “Note 2 – Going Concern” in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a “going concern.”


	 


	We have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.

	We have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of March 31, 2017.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have made no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.




	 


	We are a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.



	 






	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.




	 



	(a) Management’s Quarter Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and based on the criteria for effective internal control described

	Internal Control – Integrated Framework

	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures were not effective so as to timely identify correct and disclose information required to be included on our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports due to the Company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.


	 


	The management including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our sole officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures, or its internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any within the Company have been detected.


	 


	Material weaknesses identified by management included: lack of an audit committee and audit committee financial expert; lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and affecting the functions of authorization, recordkeeping, custody of assets, and reconciliation; and, management dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls.


	 


	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.

	Table of Contents






	 




	Management’s Remediation Initiatives




	 


	In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:


	 


	We will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us. And, we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us.


	 


	Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board.


	 


	We will work as quickly as possible to implement these initiatives; however, the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow from operations will likely slow this implementation.


	 


	This report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.


	 


	This report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of this section, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.


	 



	Change in internal controls



	 


	We have not made any significant changes to our internal controls subsequent to the Evaluation Date. We have not identified any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses or other factors other than those specified above that could significantly affect these controls, and therefore, no corrective action was taken.

North America Frac Sand to Study Leases 



















North America Frac Sand to Study Leases 


 

 


Details


Published: Wednesday, 08 February 2017 14:13 














North America Frac Sand Inc.’s David Alexander, CEO, confirmed that, as disclosed in previous news releases and filings in quarterly reports on Form 10Q and Form 8K, the company has engaged Norwest Corp. to complete a NI-43-101 report.
The purpose of the report is to evaluate the quantities and quality of the mineral resources on the company’s frac sand leases, which are located in Saskatchewan, Canada. Norwest was chosen because of their expertise to develop and optimize mineral projects. Norwest takes a comprehensive approach to help clients develop new ventures, Alexander said. They have expertise in all phases of project development from initial project planning through to the delivery of mineral products.
The company’s long-term frac sand leases are contiguous and cover over 39,000 acres. As part of the evaluation process, an auger drilling program of 35 drill holes and covering 700 acres, was completed. The samples taken from the drill holes were tested by independent labs.
The results of the test samples have been assessed and evaluated and the NI-43-101 report is in the process of being finalized. Upon receipt of the NI-43-101 report from Norwest, an 8K will be filed and a news release will disclose this information to the public, according to the company.
