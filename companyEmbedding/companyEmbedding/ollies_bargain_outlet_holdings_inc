What is Ollie's

Ollie’s Bargain Outlet is one of America’s largest retailers of closeouts, excess inventory, and salvage merchandise. Our 249 “semi-lovely” stores sell merchandise of all descriptions and some beyond description.

You’ll find real brands at real bargain prices in every department, from housewares to sporting goods to flooring and to food. Ollie’s buyers scour the world looking for closeouts, overstocks, package changes, manufacturer refurbished goods, and irregulars.
Much of the merchandise comes direct from the finest manufacturers in the country and abroad. For example, if a manufacturer makes too much of an item, or changes their packaging, Ollie’s will buy the overstocked or old packaged items. So, you will always find famous brand name products at Ollie’s, but a lot of them could be last year’s colors, patterns or packaging that traditional retailers won’t sell.
We also work with insurance companies to buy salvage merchandise. If a store in your neighborhood has a flood or fire, Ollie’s may purchase the undamaged inventory and put it in our stores at drastically reduced prices. Yes, it might smell a little smoky, but it’ll be so cheap that you won’t mind!
Ollie’s has also liquidated major retail centers, working very closely with financial institutions. When companies liquidate, the banks will often dispose of remaining inventories and turn them into cash. Ollie’s brings the goods back to our stores and passes the savings to you, the customer.
Folks, everything you buy at Ollie’s is covered by our 30-day “No Hard Time” guarantee. If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, return it within 30 days of purchase for a full refund (with sales receipt).

What is Ollie's

Ollie’s Bargain Outlet is one of America’s largest retailers of closeouts, excess inventory, and salvage merchandise. Our 249 “semi-lovely” stores sell merchandise of all descriptions and some beyond description.

You’ll find real brands at real bargain prices in every department, from housewares to sporting goods to flooring and to food. Ollie’s buyers scour the world looking for closeouts, overstocks, package changes, manufacturer refurbished goods, and irregulars.
Much of the merchandise comes direct from the finest manufacturers in the country and abroad. For example, if a manufacturer makes too much of an item, or changes their packaging, Ollie’s will buy the overstocked or old packaged items. So, you will always find famous brand name products at Ollie’s, but a lot of them could be last year’s colors, patterns or packaging that traditional retailers won’t sell.
We also work with insurance companies to buy salvage merchandise. If a store in your neighborhood has a flood or fire, Ollie’s may purchase the undamaged inventory and put it in our stores at drastically reduced prices. Yes, it might smell a little smoky, but it’ll be so cheap that you won’t mind!
Ollie’s has also liquidated major retail centers, working very closely with financial institutions. When companies liquidate, the banks will often dispose of remaining inventories and turn them into cash. Ollie’s brings the goods back to our stores and passes the savings to you, the customer.
Folks, everything you buy at Ollie’s is covered by our 30-day “No Hard Time” guarantee. If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, return it within 30 days of purchase for a full refund (with sales receipt).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

U.S. stocks close at record on back of robust labor-market data

by Victor Reklaitis









Ollie's Bargain beats fiscal Q1 sales, earnings expectations
Shares of Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings Inc.  turned lower late Wednesday after jumping nearly 4% after the retailer reported fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings above expectations. Ollie's said it earned $19 million, or 29 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $11.7 million, or 19 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company reported per-share earnings of 25 cents a share. Sales reached $227.6 million, from $193.7 million a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted and GAAP earnings of 23 cents a share on sales of $220 million. The company said it expects an increase in comparable-store sales of 1% to 2% for fiscal 2018, the opening of 33 to 35 new stores and no closures, and net income per share of $1.18 to $1.21 for the year. The company pegged net sales for fiscal 2018 at $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion. Shares of Ollie's had ended the regular session up 0.1%.

Ollie's Bargain Outlet is an American chain of retail stores founded in 1982[1] by the late Morton Bernstein. The first store was opened in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, just outside Harrisburg. The chain now has 213 locations (as of June 2016) in 19 states.[2] The president and CEO is Mark Butler.
Ollie's Bargain Outlet deals in surplus merchandise obtained from various retailers, suppliers or manufacturers throughout the country, whether in the form of closeouts, bankruptcy sales or other similar means of buying the stock at below wholesale costs.
Ollie’s stores feature its namesake co-founder Oliver E. Rosenberg, in the form of humorous caricatures throughout its stores' interiors, merchandising displays and on its logo and exterior signage. Rosenberg died in 1996 at age 75. He was a Harrisburg resident and capital area realtor and entrepreneur, but he is perhaps best remembered for his association with Ollie's Bargain Outlets. An 18-by-18-inch commemorative paver with his trademark humorous visage can be found near the entrance to the children's playground inside Adams-Ricci Community Park in Enola, Pennsylvania.




Ollie's Store, Ypsilanti, Michigan


In 2008, the chain consolidated its four distribution warehouses into one located in York, Pennsylvania. In 2014 the chain opened its second distribution center in Commerce, Georgia.[3]

Initial public offering[edit]
An IPO was launched on July 16, 2015 at $16.00/share.[4]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]
In the 2006 NASCAR Busch Series, Ollie's sponsored the #43 car of Kertus Davis at Dover. The following year, the company sponsored Jamie McMurray's #37 car in the same Busch Series race held at Dover. In 2008, Ollie's sponsored the Ollie's Bargain Outlet 360 Challenge with Kasey Kahne, Dave Blaney and Tony Stewart. In 2010 Ollie's sponsored the #33 Chevy Silverado driven by Ron Hornaday for the Pocono Raceway truck series race. His team, Kevin Harvick Inc., has been sponsored by Ollie's since the beginning of 2010.
After much exposure during the 2012 Daytona 500, where Tommy Baldwin Racing's Dave Blaney was leading at the time of the red flag, Ollie's extended their sponsorship of the team's #36 for later races.

Ollie's Bargain Outlet is an American chain of retail stores founded in 1982[1] by the late Morton Bernstein. The first store was opened in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, just outside Harrisburg. The chain now has 213 locations (as of June 2016) in 19 states.[2] The president and CEO is Mark Butler.
Ollie's Bargain Outlet deals in surplus merchandise obtained from various retailers, suppliers or manufacturers throughout the country, whether in the form of closeouts, bankruptcy sales or other similar means of buying the stock at below wholesale costs.
Ollie’s stores feature its namesake co-founder Oliver E. Rosenberg, in the form of humorous caricatures throughout its stores' interiors, merchandising displays and on its logo and exterior signage. Rosenberg died in 1996 at age 75. He was a Harrisburg resident and capital area realtor and entrepreneur, but he is perhaps best remembered for his association with Ollie's Bargain Outlets. An 18-by-18-inch commemorative paver with his trademark humorous visage can be found near the entrance to the children's playground inside Adams-Ricci Community Park in Enola, Pennsylvania.




Ollie's Store, Ypsilanti, Michigan


In 2008, the chain consolidated its four distribution warehouses into one located in York, Pennsylvania. In 2014 the chain opened its second distribution center in Commerce, Georgia.[3]

Initial public offering[edit]
An IPO was launched on July 16, 2015 at $16.00/share.[4]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]
In the 2006 NASCAR Busch Series, Ollie's sponsored the #43 car of Kertus Davis at Dover. The following year, the company sponsored Jamie McMurray's #37 car in the same Busch Series race held at Dover. In 2008, Ollie's sponsored the Ollie's Bargain Outlet 360 Challenge with Kasey Kahne, Dave Blaney and Tony Stewart. In 2010 Ollie's sponsored the #33 Chevy Silverado driven by Ron Hornaday for the Pocono Raceway truck series race. His team, Kevin Harvick Inc., has been sponsored by Ollie's since the beginning of 2010.
After much exposure during the 2012 Daytona 500, where Tommy Baldwin Racing's Dave Blaney was leading at the time of the red flag, Ollie's extended their sponsorship of the team's #36 for later races.
