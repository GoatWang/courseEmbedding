Review This Product














                As Christians, we all know the apostle Paul, don't we? He is our theological master, our pastoral mentor, our spiritual advisor and our missionary hero. Yet just when we think we have him in our grasp, we find he slips through our fingers. At the point where we suppose we have finally understood him, Paul again confounds us and stirs our hearts and minds further. 

A lively new survey of the life and ministry of the apostle Paul.
Michael Bird offers an insightful, readable, and serious (yet occasionally witty) introduction to Paul in conversation with the best scholarship on the apostle. It will be especially useful for those who think they know Paul well but have the courage to take a fresh look and have their assumptions challenged. Particularly important are Bird's discussions of justification and of the gospel itself. Let those who have ears to hear listen to what the Spirit--via Paul and Bird--is saying to the people of God in a world that seems increasingly similar to Paul's".

Our Story

Recognizing a shift in the marketplace, the decline of the American dollar, as well as the need to recycle; the Paul Michael Company began its’ biggest endeavor to date by manufacturing its’ own line of accessories and furniture that Paul designs. He felt that the only way the company would be able to separate itself from the market would be to create its’ own line of exclusive items that Paul feels will be the antiques of tomorrow. Today we refer to these original designs as Paul’s World ~reclaim, reuse, recycle, redecorate~ everything is 100% American made and the majority of items are constructed of architectural salvage and reclaimed wood that Paul has been collecting for years.  In Dermott, AR the Paul Michael Company now has a woodshop buzzing 7 days a week, developing, manufacturing and designing amazing pieces for your home.
We take pride in offering Paul Michael Company Exclusives, pieces designed by our founder and handcrafted at our Dermott, AR woodshop, to our customers looking for one-of-a-kind offerings to adorn their homes.

Our Values
For us, producing the highest quality professional hair care available is simply not enough. John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always will be) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place. We were the first professional beauty company to stand up against animal testing and our charitable efforts continue to set the standard for giving in our industry. A commitment to caring for people and the planet is a driving force in everything we do.

No Animal Testing
Never Have. Never Will.
In 1980, we became the first professional beauty company to publicly stand up against animal testing. Now, nearly 35 years later, that pledge to our furry friends remains a driving force in all that we do.







Caring For Our Planet
Live Beautifully
Whether we're planting trees, protecting animals or preserving our natural resources, John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always has been) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.











Product Control
The Real Deal on Diversion
Diversion occurs when professional salon products are sold by unauthorized retailers. Oftentimes these products are old, stolen, counterfeit or tampered with. That's why you should only purchase John Paul Mitchell Systems products within the professional beauty salon industry.







Research & Development
Our product development process begins in our state-of-the-art Product Innovation Center (PIC), in Santa Clarita, California. It's here where our products are researched, formulated and tested (on humans!). From concept to completion, our talented teams work hand-in-hand to perfect every formula and bring our newest innovations to life.







The Awapuhi Farm
Green from the get-go. In 1983, our co-founders established a self-sustaining, solar-powered Awapuhi farm in Hawaii—all of the Awapuhi used in our products is still harvested there today.

Fleas and Tips from Paul and Debbie Michael
categories: Paul's World, Tips and Trends


With over 35 years of shopping, buying and selling at flea markets all over the country, Paul and Debbie Michael are happy to share a few good tips on how to find the best stuff.  All flea markets have a really small community of antique dealers and vendors who travel the country and show up together to attend the circuit of shows that usually occur from Spring all the way through Fall.  It is easy to look online to find a flea market near you!
Step 1 – Get there early; beat the crowds.  If the event starts on a Friday and it is a larger size show, it is a good idea to arrive a day or two early.  Lots of trading among dealers take place as they unload their trucks and trailers.  The early bird catches the worm.
GET THERE EARLY
Step 2 – If there is a site map available, it is a great idea to get one.  Familiarize yourself with the grounds, and ask where the best dealers usually set up. Be specific about what you are hunting for.  Whether it be antique buttons, military items, vintage clothing, crafts, etc., keep your eye on the prize.   The dealers generally set up in the same spots which ends up being like a community or little neighborhood.  If you are really in it for the hunt, and are just looking for whatever catches your eye, find the areas where dealers set up that do not come on a regular basis.  Some markets refer to this as the unreserved area.  Their tables ‎will be filled with anything and everything. This is the spot where you just might find your hidden gem.
GET A MAP
 
Step 3 –  It is always a good idea to have a specific item in mind when you begin your hunt.  Do a little research if you are on the hunt for specific items so you will have a good idea of the current market price.  Paul says, “the most important ingredient of buying an item, is deciding in your mind what you are willing to pay, and what the true market value is.”  Keep in mind that the price the dealer is asking will be at market value or a little above.  Half the fun of attending the flea market to find your treasure is not only the hunt but also the negotiation.  Dealers appreciate the art of a negotiation!  Be prepared, and do NOT Google an item in the presence of a dealer.  There are definite rules of etiquette to follow when making a deal, and this is a big insult to a dealer.  They tend to be a little cranky anyway, and this could ruin your chances of buying your merchandise at a lower price.  Once you have spotted the item of interest, you need to decide in your mind what you are willing to pay for it.  Feel free to check it out as much as you like and ask as many questions as you have.  You will find that most of the dealers are honest, knowledgeable, and enjoy sharing any and all the information they have.

Mirror, Mirror On the Wall
categories: Decorating Trends, Entertaining, Tips and Trends


Bedrooms are often the most private rooms in the house, making them the most personal.  One’s personal style is  usually best reflected in the bedroom, so adding bedding and headboards to our product offerings for the Spring 2015 season gave our designers the opportunity to fully dive into experimenting with bedroom looks for the first time in our stores.
For our first bedroom photoshoot we really wanted to go for something unexpected.  Using some fairy tale inspiration, our designers created a sophisticated and striking sleep space.

Turning a House into a Home
categories: Decorating Trends, Entertaining, Tips and Trends

This spring season (now getting into the beginning of summer) we have had the opportunity to stage a handful of empty houses as well as give some lived-in residences a PMC home makeover.  Staging an empty house comes with no design restraints, so the process is fairly painless.  The challenges arise when decorating or redecorating a home.  People often feel they must stay within one style element in order to create an attractive interior.  Paul Michael Company designer, Jenny, believes people often limit themselves when thinking they must stay within the confines of certain design.  “It happens all the time.  People think they can’t buy new pieces they are in love with because it won’t mix with their existing decor,” Jenny says, “But it is so easy to integrate new pieces with existing decor seamlessly.”
Here at Paul Michael Company, we believe turning a house into a home entails knowing what style you like, but also keeping an open mind when it comes to integrating new pieces into your existing design; giving a house personality is when it really becomes a home.
Recently our Monroe store manager, Debra, moved into a new house and immediately requested Jenny’s assistance when making this space her own.  Debra gave Jenny free reign when it came to putting this look together, other than telling her she gravitates toward “shabby chic” designs.  Integrating new pieces with Debra’s existing decor and adding a bit of flare, Jenny and Monroe employee, Ashley, transformed an empty house into the home Debra hoped for.
