The original GENUINE Smith brand of 
  wood restoration products:
Invented by Steve Smith and manufactured by Smith & Co.
Steve Smith in 1972 invented this modern technology that restores deteriorated wood.  The entire scientific foundation is shown at www.woodrestoration.com


Smith's Clear 
      Penetrating Epoxy Sealer™ Also known as CPES™


Restoration 
      Kits now available!


Smith's Fill-It 
      Epoxy Filler™


MultiWoodPrime™


In 1976, studying a seventy-year-old chemistry text, Steve Smith found some 
  lost-technology in the field of concrete sealers.  This led to the introduction 
  of Smith's Permanent Concrete Sealer.  In the next few years, he designed 
  a permanent-bonding technology for cement and stucco that was solvent-free, 
  odor-free and green-as-you-can-get.  Doing the job once eliminates all 
  the environmental pollution of coming back again and again to do the job over 
  again.
The first-ever approval by the Swedish government for such a product was given in 1992.
Those products are now brought together under the Permanetrix™ 
  brand of long-lasting bonding primers and sealers for mineral surfaces.



Smith's Permanent 
      Stucco Primer™ Does for stucco what CPES does for wood.


Smith's Damp Concrete 
      Primer™


Smith's Permanent 
      Concrete Sealer™


Smith's Paving 
      Brick Sealer™



Other Smith & Company products solve problems and offer new opportunities:
In 1974 Steve Smith developed the first epoxy adhesive to reliably bond oily hardwoods.  His original Tropical Hardwood Epoxy and a popular expanded family of epoxy products are used today by not only individual boat-builders, but furniture restorers, specialty wood millworks, manufacturers of archery bows, baseball bats, speaker cabinets and many other high-performance wood products.


Smith's 
      Tropical Hardwood Epoxy Glue™ (glues any wood)


Smith's Oak & Teak Epoxy 
      Glue™ (highest performance on oak and teak)


Smith's Layup 
      & Laminating  Epoxy (for fiberglass layup)


 


Wood Vitality™ gives Fresher-Treated 
      Wood™ - Give your wood deck some rot resistance! Wood Vitality 
      is a two step waterborne product that impregnates wood with zinc borate, 
      a very well-known, almost insoluble material that is safe for humans and 
      does not interfere with any later wood-treatment or staining or finishing 
      product. Rot fungi, mold and insects don't like it. Not at all. It is essentially 
      harmless to us humans and our pets.


Mold Resist™ 
      – a unique, non-hazardous waterborne product, solvent-free and odor-free, 
      that discourages mold and mildew growth on any porous surface.


Smith's High Build Epoxy Paint™ - A moisture diffusion barrier coating 
      used in the repair 
      and prevention of gelcoat blisters (osmotic blisters, fiberglass 
      pox, etc.) on fiberglass/polyester boats, as well as coating steel boat 
      hulls, exterior architectural steel, outdoor ponds and other applications.


Epifanes Gloss Varnish - Now in stock! Please call 1-800-234-0330 to place 
      your order today.


Smith & Co. now offers what we believe to be the best traditional marine spar varnish available, for use when cost, weather, and applicator qualifications do not allow use of our Five Year Clear™. We tested it, and other varnishes in our laboratory under high-intensity ultraviolet light. Epifanes varnish held its gloss the best and lasted the longest. Skeptical?
