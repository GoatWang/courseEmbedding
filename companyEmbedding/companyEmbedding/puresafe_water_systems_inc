NEW YORK, Jan. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PURESAFE WATER SYSTEMS, INC. (OTCBB: PSWS), a manufacturer of a unique patented mobile and stationary water purification and filtration system, letter to Shareholders, January 2017.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:








The year, 2016, was a year of significant progress for the company, in spite of the tremendous financial difficulties that we faced on a daily basis. We executed on several initiatives and continued to make great strides in delivering on the strategic initiatives that we have been working on for more than a year to improve our product and delivery of our technology in new and exciting business sectors. Overall, the company's competitive posture, future promise and foundation for growth are all stronger today than a year ago.

We have rebranded our technology from the PureSafe First Response Water System (FRWS) to the PureSafe Water Purification Unit (WPU). This rebranding was significant as it positioned our technology as a viable product to penetrate multiple new target markets globally.


We have redesigned and manufactured our Next Generation Water Purification Unit (WPU) which increased the WPU's efficiency, scalability, mobility, versatility and adaptable to an array of new target markets. We believe that the Next Generation WPU is poised to make a dramatic impact on any application that requires varying degrees of water purification.


We have revamped our Leasing & Rental Programs with a higher level of flexibility to attract clients based on their immediate needs and timeframes.


We have shifted our business model to penetrate multiple new target markets globally. This strategic initiative have identified clients, Earlier Adopters / Visionaries and collectively, we have analyzed the costs associated with their wastewater management requirements and offer an innovative way to cost effectively streamline their wastewater management practices.


We have formalized a relationship with an equipment financing company to eliminate any objections in the initial purchase of our WPU.

As a result of these executed initiatives, we secured a rental opportunity with a highly visible industrial application; we closed a sale with our Next Generation WPU in the newly targeted Agribusiness market; we are forging a strategic relationship to penetrate the newly targeted Laundry Services market and our WPU is being considered to solve an array of water purification problems in Latin America.
The outlook for 2017 is good! With the success of the targeted markets that we have penetrated, we are building demand and have requests for several product demonstrations, which are scheduled for the first quarter of this year. Moreover, we believe that we can replicate this initial success as we penetrate additional new target markets. Despite the financial difficulties that we faced in 2016 we will, nonetheless, continue to meet each and every challenge with the same vigor, focus and relentless drive to ensure continue success. I truly couldn't be more excited and optimistic!
As always, thank you for your support,
Leslie J. KesslerChairman & Chief Executive Officer

Mid South Heat Transfer Fluids (Inhibited Glycols)
                            Mid South Chemical Inhibited Propylene Glycol and Inhibited Ethylene Glycol

Propylene and Ethylene glycol are commonly used heat transfer fluids for protection in Industrial and Commercial closed loop, water based HVAC, and cooling systems.  These glycols come in both inhibited and uninhibited but as you can see from the picture above, better system protection can be achieved where a properly selected inhibited glycol is used.
Why choose inhibited glycol?  When glycol is exposed to heat or oxygen, it can break down and cause damage to the metals in the system.  By using inhibited glycols,  the system is buffered to protect against this damage and provide corrosion protection as well.
How do I know which glycol to use?  Ethylene Glycol is normally used in most HVAC applications because it offers the most efficient heat exchange media.  Propylene Glycol is used where possible contact with potable water and food could occur.
 
Mid South Chemical sells heat transfer fluids (inhibited and uninhibited glycols)
Inhibited Ethylene Glycol (-60⁰F to 250⁰F)
Uninhibited Ethylene Glycol
Inhibited Propylene Glycol (-50⁰F to 250⁰F)
Uninhibited Propylene Glycol
 
Inhibited Ethylene Glycol
Mid South Chemicals inhibited technical grade Ethylene Glycol is designed for industrial and commercial application. It contains Mid South Chemical Glyhib Inhibitor package for multi metal system protection.  Glyhib is composed of inhibitors and buffers that stabilize pH levels and passivate metal surfaces for continuous corrosion protection.
Inhibited Propylene Glycol
Mid South Chemical technical grade propylene glycol designed for use in most industrial and commercial applications. It also contains Mid South Chemicals Glyhib Inhibitor for multi metal protection.
 
Mid South Chemicals inhibited glycols utilize a unique corrosion inhibitor package that provides superior corrosion protection for most metals including yellow metal. It also stabilizes the system pH to maintain an environment for less corrosive conditions.
Can be purchased as full strength or DI water can be added to any desired solution %.
 
Glyhib (inhibitor for glycols) can also be purchased as a concentrate.

PureSafe Water Systems, Inc. 2017 Letter to Shareholders






Jan 19, 2017, 7:28am EST














NEW YORK, Jan. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PURESAFE WATER SYSTEMS, INC. (OTCBB: PSWS), a manufacturer of a unique patented mobile and stationary water purification and filtration system, letter to Shareholders, January 2017.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
The year, 2016, was a year of significant progress for the company, in spite of the tremendous financial difficulties that we faced on a daily basis. We executed on several initiatives and continued to make great strides in delivering on the strategic initiatives that we have been working on for more than a year to improve our product and delivery of our technology in new and exciting business sectors. Overall, the company's competitive posture, future promise and foundation for growth are all stronger today than a year ago.

We have rebranded our technology from the PureSafe First Response Water System (FRWS) to the PureSafe Water Purification Unit (WPU). This rebranding was significant as it positioned our technology as a viable product to penetrate multiple new target markets globally.

We have redesigned and manufactured our Next Generation Water Purification Unit (WPU) which increased the WPU's efficiency, scalability, mobility, versatility and adaptable to an array of new target markets. We believe that the Next Generation WPU is poised to make a dramatic impact on any application that requires varying degrees of water purification.

We have revamped our Leasing & Rental Programs with a higher level of flexibility to attract clients based on their immediate needs and timeframes.

We have shifted our business model to penetrate multiple new target markets globally. This strategic initiative have identified clients, Earlier Adopters / Visionaries and collectively, we have analyzed the costs associated with their wastewater management requirements and offer an innovative way to cost effectively streamline their wastewater management practices.

We have formalized a relationship with an equipment financing company to eliminate any objections in the initial purchase of our WPU.
As a result of these executed initiatives, we secured a rental opportunity with a highly visible industrial application; we closed a sale with our Next Generation WPU in the newly targeted Agribusiness market; we are forging a strategic relationship to penetrate the newly targeted Laundry Services market and our WPU is being considered to solve an array of water purification problems in Latin America.
The outlook for 2017 is good! With the success of the targeted markets that we have penetrated, we are building demand and have requests for several product demonstrations, which are scheduled for the first quarter of this year. Moreover, we believe that we can replicate this initial success as we penetrate additional new target markets. Despite the financial difficulties that we faced in 2016 we will, nonetheless, continue to meet each and every challenge with the same vigor, focus and relentless drive to ensure continue success. I truly couldn't be more excited and optimistic!
As always, thank you for your support,
Leslie J. KesslerChairman & Chief Executive Officer

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

We executed on several initiatives and continued to make great strides in delivering on the strategic initiatives that we have been working on for more than a year to improve our product and delivery of our technology in new and exciting business sectors. Overall, the company's competitive posture, future promise and foundation for growth are all stronger today than a year ago.We have rebranded our technology from the PureSafe First Response Water System (FRWS) to the PureSafe Water Purification Unit (WPU). This rebranding was significant as it positioned our technology as a viable product to penetrate multiple new target markets globally.We have redesigned and manufactured our Next Generation Water Purification Unit (WPU) which increased the WPU's efficiency, scalability, mobility, versatility and adaptable to an array of new target markets. We believe that the Next Generation WPU is poised to make a dramatic impact on any application that requires varying degrees of water purification.We have revamped our Leasing & Rental Programs with a higher level of flexibility to attract clients based on their immediate needs and timeframes.We have shifted our business model to penetrate multiple new target markets globally. This strategic initiative have identified clients, Earlier Adopters / Visionaries and collectively, we have analyzed the costs associated with their wastewater management requirements and offer an innovative way to cost effectively streamline their wastewater management practices.We have formalized a relationship with an equipment financing company to eliminate any objections in the initial purchase of our WPU.As a result of these executed initiatives, we secured a rental opportunity with a highly visible industrial application; we closed a sale with our Next Generation WPU in the newly targeted Agribusiness market; we are forging a strategic relationship to penetrate the newly targeted Laundry Services market and our WPU is being considered to solve an array of water purification problems in Latin America.The outlook for 2017 is good! With the success of the targeted markets that we have penetrated, we are building demand and have requests for several product demonstrations, which are scheduled for the first quarter of this year. Moreover, we believe that we can replicate this initial success as we penetrate additional new target markets. Despite the financial difficulties that we faced in 2016 we will, nonetheless, continue to meet each and every challenge with the same vigor, focus and relentless drive to ensure continue success.
