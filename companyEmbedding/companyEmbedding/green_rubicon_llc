The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Rubicon is the world leader in sapphire crystal growth technology andlarge-diameter sapphire substrates.

With its unmatched, end-to-end ability to manufacture and deliver superior quality sapphire, Rubicon helps manufacturers in the LED, RFIC and optical industries achieve challenging targets for product performance, yield and total cost. As demand for larger diameter sapphire escalates, more manufacturers in dynamic, growing markets trust Rubicon and its proven ability to deliver high volumes of the highest quality substrates.




Patterned Sapphire Substrates
Rubicon Technology, Inc., the global leader inlarge-diameter sapphire substrates, has leveraged its unique expertise to create a complete line of Patterned Sapphire Substrates—PSS—up to 8” in diameter. We offer fully customizable sub-micron patterning capability with tight dimensional tolerances, within ± 0.1 μm. With an edge exclusion zone as small as 1 mm, Rubicon gives you more usable area to maximize the number of chips per wafer. 

 

Vertical Integration – Powder to Pattern
Rubicon Technology is the only sapphire manufacturer that is vertically integrated from the processing of raw aluminum oxide powder to the creation of highly customized patterned sapphire substrates.  Vertical integration has fostered the ability to grow progressively larger sapphire while maintaining exceptional sapphire quality, controlling cost, and excelling as the industry’s most reliable, consistent and innovative technology partner.
