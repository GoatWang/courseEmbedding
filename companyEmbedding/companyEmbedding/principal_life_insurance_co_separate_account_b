Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

                        to help you make retirement planning or other personal financial decisions. Responsibility for these
                        decisions is assumed by you, not Principal. Individual results will vary.
                        You should regularly review your savings progress and post-retirement needs.            



              All projections, analysis and calculation results are estimates and depend on many factors,

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

                                or non-qualified retirement plan assets.

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

Annual Pay



                In most situations, this is either your annual base

                              most accurately reflects the pay your recurring

Retirement Savings



                This amount should include the total assets that you have designated
                                for retirement purposes. This could include employer sponsored retirement
                                plans, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA), mutual funds, stocks, bonds,
                                or non-qualified retirement plan assets.              




















                Principal takes retirement planning—which seems to be a very complicated, scary topic—and makes it more friendly and engaging.

The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the contract for the time periods
indicated. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each   
year and assumes the maximum fees and expenses of any of the underlying mutual  
funds. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these        
assumptions, your costs would be:

SUMMARY 

This prospectus describes a flexible variable annuity offered by the Company.   
The Contract is designed to provide individuals with retirement benefits,       
including plans and trusts that do not qualify for special tax treatment under  
the Code and for purchase by persons participating in individual retirement     
annuity plans that meet the requirements of Section 408 of the Code.            

A significant advantage of the Contract is that it provides the ability to      
accumulate capital on a tax-deferred basis. The purchase of a Contract to fund a
tax-qualified retirement account does not provide any additional tax deferred   
treatment of earnings beyond the treatment provided by the tax-qualified        
retirement plan itself. However, the Contract does provide benefits such as     
lifetime income payments, family protection through death benefits and asset    
allocation.                                                                     

This is a brief summary of the Contract's features. More detailed information   
follows later in this prospectus.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT INVESTMENT OPTIONS (SEE THE FUNDS):                            
You may allocate your net premium payments to divisions and/or the Fixed        
Account. Not all divisions are available in all states. A current list of       
divisions available in your state may be obtained from a sales representative or
the annuity service office.                                                     

Each division invests in shares of an underlying mutual fund. More detailed     
information about the underlying mutual funds may be found in the current       
prospectus for each underlying mutual fund.

* For the period from April 30, 1999, date the Contract was first available,  
through December 31, 1999.                                                    

THE PRINCIPAL FREEDOM/SM/ VARIABLE ANNUITY 

The Principal Freedom/SM/ Variable Annuity is significantly different from a    
fixed annuity. As the owner of a variable annuity, you assume the risk of       
investment gain or loss (as to amounts in the divisions) rather than the        
insurance company. The amount available for annuity payments under a variable   
annuity is not guaranteed. The amount available for payments vary with the      
investment performance of the portfolio securities of the underlying mutual     
fund(s).                                                                        

Based on your investment objectives, you direct the allocation of purchase      
payments and accumulated values. There can be no assurance that your investment 
objectives will be achieved.

THE COMPANY 

The Company is a stock life insurance company with its home office at: Principal
Financial Group, Des Moines, Iowa 50392. It is authorized to transact life and  
annuity business in all states of the United States and the District of         
Columbia. The Company is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Principal        
Financial Group, Inc., a publicly-traded company.                               

In 1879, the Company was incorporated under Iowa law as a mutual assessment life
insurance company named Bankers Life Association. It became a legal reserve life
insurance company and changed its name to Bankers Life Company in 1911 and then 
to Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1986. The name change to Principal
Life Insurance Company and reorganization into a mutual insurance holding       
company structure took place in 1998, when the Company became a stock life      
insurance company. In 2001, the mutual insurance holding company converted to a 
stock company through a process called demutualization, resulting in the current
organizational structure.                                                       

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

The Separate Account was established under Iowa law on January 12, 1970. It was 
registered as a unit investment trust with the Commission on July 17, 1970. This
registration does not involve Commission supervision of the investments or      
investment policies of the Separate Account.                                    

The income, gains, and losses, whether or not realized, of the Separate Account 
are credited to or charged against the Separate Account without regard to other 
income, gains, or losses of the Company. Obligations arising from the Contract, 
including the promise to make annuity payments, are general corporate           
obligations of the Company. However, the Contract provides that the portion of  
the Separate Account's assets equal to the reserves and other liabilities under 
the Contract are not charged with any liabilities arising out of any other      
business of the Company.                                                        

The assets of each division invest in a corresponding mutual fund. New divisions
may be added and made available. Divisions may also be eliminated from the      
Separate Account.                                                               

THE FUNDS 

The Principal Variable Contracts Fund, Inc., American Century Variable          
Portfolios, Inc. - VP Income & Growth and Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance 
Products Trust - Templeton Growth Securities Fund are mutual funds registered   
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as diversified open-end investment     
management companies. The underlying mutual funds provide the investment        
vehicles for the Separate Account. A full description of the underlying mutual  
funds, the investment objectives, policies and restrictions, charges and        
expenses and other operational information are contained in the accompanying    
prospectuses (which should be read carefully before investing) and the SAI.     
ADDITIONAL COPIES OF THESE DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE WITHOUT CHARGE FROM A SALES  
REPRESENTATIVE OR OUR ANNUITY SERVICE OFFICE (CALL 1-800-852-4450).             

The Company purchases and sells underlying mutual fund shares for the Separate  
Account at their net asset value without any sales or redemption charge. Shares 
represent interests in the mutual fund available for investment by the Separate 
Account. Each underlying mutual fund corresponds to one of the divisions of the 
Separate Account. The assets of each division are separate from the others. A   
division's performance has no effect on the investment performance of any other 
division.                                                                       

The underlying mutual funds are NOT available to the general public directly.   
The underlying mutual funds are available only as investment options in variable
life insurance policies or variable annuity contracts issued by life insurance  
companies and qualified plans. Some of the underlying mutual funds have been    
established by investment advisers that manage publicly traded mutual funds     
having similar names and investment objectives. While some of the underlying    
mutual funds may be similar to, and may in fact be modeled after publicly traded
mutual funds, you should understand that the underlying mutual funds are not    
otherwise directly related to any publicly traded mutual fund. Consequently, the
investment performance of publicly traded mutual funds and of any underlying    
mutual fund may differ substantially.

Appendix A contains a brief summary of the investment objectives of, and        
sub-advisor for, each division.                                                 

An Investment Advisor agrees to provide investment advisory services for a      
specific underlying mutual fund. For these services, each Investment Advisor is 
paid a fee.                                                                     

THE CONTRACT 

The descriptions that follow are based on provisions of the Contract offered by 
this prospectus. You should refer to the actual Contract and the terms and      
limitations of any tax qualified plan which is to be funded by the Contract. Tax
qualified plans are subject to several requirements and limitations which may   
affect the terms of any particular Contract or the advisability of taking       
certain action permitted by the Contract.                                       

TO BUY A CONTRACT 
If you want to buy a Contract, you must submit an application and make an       
initial purchase payment. If the application is complete and the Contract       
applied for is suitable, the Contract is issued. If the completed application is
received in proper order, the initial purchase payment is credited within two   
valuation days after the later of receipt of the application or receipt of the  
initial purchase payment at the Company's home office. If the initial purchase  
payment is not credited within five valuation days, it is refunded unless we    
have received your permission to retain the purchase payment until we receive   
the information necessary to issue the Contract.                                

Purchase payments                                                               
-----------------                                                               
The initial purchase payment must be at least $10,000. Subsequent payments must 
be at least $50. The total of all purchase payments may not be greater than     
$2,000,000 without our prior approval.                                          

Allocation of purchase payments                                                 
-------------------------------                                                 
Your purchase payments are allocated to the divisions and/or the Fixed Account  
according to your instructions. The percentage allocation for future purchase   
payments may be changed, without charge, at any time by sending a written       
request to or telephoning the annuity service office. The allocation changes are
effective at the end of the valuation period in which your new instructions are 
received. You may not allocate your investment to the Fixed Account if it causes
the value of the Fixed Account to be more than $1,000,000 (without our prior    
approval).                                                                      

RIGHT TO EXAMINE THE CONTRACT (FREE-LOOK)                                       
Under state law, you have the right to return the Contract for any reason during
the examination period. The examination period is 10 days after the Contract is 
delivered to you in all states, unless your Contract is issued in:              
.. Arizona and you are age 65 and over (30 day examination period),             
.. California and you are age 60 and over (30 day examination period),          
.. Idaho (20 day examination period), or                                        
.. North Dakota (20 day examination period).                                    

Some states require us to return the initial purchase payment. If your Contract 
is issued in one of those states, your initial purchase payments are allocated  
to the Money Market Division for the examination period after the contract date.
After the examination period, the then current value of the Money Market        
Division is reallocated according to your allocation instructions. The states in
which purchase payments are returned are:                                       

                                                                [Download Table]

close of business on the last day of the examination period. If you send the    
request (properly addressed and postage prepaid) to the annuity service office, 
the date of the postmark is used to determine if the examination period has     
expired.

If the purchase of this Contract is a replacement for another annuity contract  
or a life insurance policy, different examination periods may apply. The Company
reserves the right to keep the initial purchase payment in the Money Market     
Division longer than 15 days to correspond to the examination periods of a      
particular state's replacement requirement.                                     

THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD 
The Value of Your Contract                                                      
--------------------------                                                      
The value of your Contract is the total of the Separate Account value plus any  
Fixed Account value. The Fixed Account value is described in the section titled 
FIXED ACCOUNT.                                                                  

There is no guaranteed minimum Separate Account value. Its value reflects the   
investment experience of the divisions that you choose. It also reflects your   
purchase payments, partial surrenders and the Contract expenses deducted from   
the Separate Account.                                                           

The Separate Account division accumulated value changes from day to day. To the 
extent the accumulated value is allocated to the Separate Account, you bear the 
investment risk. At the end of any valuation period, your Contract's value in a 
division is:                                                                    
.. the number of units you have in a division multiplied by                     
.. the value of a unit in the division.                                         

The number of units is the total of units purchased by allocations to the       
division from:                                                                  
.. your initial purchase payment;                                               
.. subsequent investments; and                                                  
.. transfers from another division or the Fixed Account.                        
minus units sold:                                                               
.. for partial surrenders from the division;                                    
.. as part of a transfer to another division or the Fixed Account; and          
.. to pay Contract charges and fees.                                            

Unit values are calculated each valuation date at the close of normal trading of
the NYSE. To calculate the unit value of a division, the unit value from the    
previous valuation date is multiplied by the divisions' net investment factor   
for the current valuation period. The number of units does not change due to a  
change in unit value.                                                           

The net investment factor measures the performance of each division. The net    
investment factor for a valuation period is (((a) plus (b)) divided by (c))     
minus (d) where:                                                                
.. (a) is the share price (net asset value) of the underlying mutual fund at the
end of the valuation period;                                                
.. (b) is the per share amount of any dividend* (or other distribution) made by 
the mutual fund during the valuation period;                                
.. (c) is the share price (net asset value) of the underlying mutual fund at the
end of the previous valuation period; and                                   
.. (d) are the total Separate Account annual expenses.                          
* When an investment owned by an underlying mutual fund pays a dividend, the
  dividend increases the net asset value of a share of the underlying mutual
 fund as of the date the dividend is recorded. As the net asset value of a
share of an underlying mutual fund increases, the unit value of the     
corresponding division also reflects an

   increase. Payment of a dividend under these circumstances does not increase
the number of units you own in the division.                            

The Separate Account charges (if any) and the mortality and expense risks charge
are calculated by dividing the annual amount of the charge by 365 and           
multiplying by the number of days in the valuation period.                      

Premium Payments

.. On your application, you direct your premium payments to be allocated to the 
investment options.                                                         
.. Allocations may be in percentages.                                           
.. Percentages must be in whole numbers and total 100%.

. You can change the current allocations and future allocation instructions 
by:

transfer any existing investment option accumulated values. You must provide
specific instructions to transfer existing accumulated values.              
.. Premium payments are credited on the basis of unit value next determined after
we receive a premium payment.

Death Benefit

If you or the annuitant die before the annuitization date, then we will pay a   
death benefit. In the case of joint annuitants, the death benefit is paid upon  
death of the first annuitant. If the owner is not a natural person, death       
benefits are paid to the beneficiary(ies) upon the death of the annuitant.      

P-->485APOS20th�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
Before the annuitization date, you may give us written instructions for payment 
under an annuity payment option. If we do not receive your instructions, the    
death benefit is paid according to instructions from the beneficiary. No        
surrender charge applies when a death benefit is paid.                          

You name the beneficiary or beneficiaries in your application. The              
beneficiary(ies) receive benefits upon your death. If the owner is not a natural
person, death benefits are paid to the beneficiary(ies) upon the death of the   
annuitant.                                                                      

Unless you have named an irrevocable beneficiary, you may change your           
beneficiary(ies) by providing us with written notice. If a beneficiary dies     
before you, on your death we will make equal payments to the surviving          
beneficiaries unless you had provided us with other written instructions. If    
none of your beneficiaries survives you, we will pay the death benefit to your  
estate in a lump sum.                                                           

The death benefit is usually paid within seven days of our receiving all        
documents (including proof of death) that we require to process the claim and   
the beneficiary's written instructions. Some states require this payment to be  
made in less than seven days. Under certain circumstances, this payment may be  
delayed (see GENERAL PROVISIONS - Delay of Payments). We pay interest (at least 
3% or as required by state law) on the death benefit from the date we receive   
all required documents until payment is made or until the death benefit is      
applied under an annuity payment option.                                        

Standard Death Benefit                                                        
----------------------                                                        
The amount of the death benefit is the greater of:                            
. your accumulated value on the date we receive all required documents; or  
. the total of purchase payments minus any partial surrenders, fees and     
charges as of the date we receive all required documents and notice     
(including proof) of death.                                             

If you die before the annuitant and your beneficiary is your spouse, we will  
continue the Contract with your spouse as the new owner. Alternatively, within
60 days of your death, your spouse may elect to:                              
. apply the death benefit under an annuity payment option; or               
. receive the death benefit as a single payment.                            

If the annuitant dies before you and is not a joint owner, you may name a new 
annuitant. If a new annuitant is not named within 60 days of our receiving    
 notice (including proof) of the original annuitant's death, you will become the
annuitant. If the owner of the contract is not a natural person, the          
annuitant's death is treated as the death of the owner.                       

If your beneficiary is a natural person but not your spouse, the death benefit
may be paid as:                                                               
. fixed income for a period of years that is not greater than the life      
expectancy of the beneficiary;                                          
  . life income with no minimum guaranteed period or a minimum guaranteed period
that is not greater than the life expectancy of the beneficiary;        
. a lump sum; or                                                            
. an individual arrangement approved by us.                                 

NOTE: If your beneficiary is not a natural person, the death benefit must be  
     paid out within five years of your death. If you die before the annuitant
   and before the annuitization date, there may be additional requirements
imposed by the Code (see FEDERAL TAX MATTERS).                      

THE RETIREMENT PERIOD 

Annuitization date                                                              
------------------                                                              
You may specify an annuitization date in your application. If the annuitant is  
living and the Contract is in force on that date, we will notify you to begin   
taking payments under the Contract. You may not select an annuitization date    
which is on or after the later of the annuitant's 85th birthday or 10 years     
after the contract date.                                                        

P-->485APOS21st�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
Depending on the type of retirement arrangement made when a Contract is issued, 
payments that are made too early or too late may be subject to penalty taxes    
(see FEDERAL TAX MATTERS). You should consider this carefully when you select or
change the annuitization date.                                                  

You may change the annuitization date with our prior approval. The request must 
be in writing and approved before we issue a supplementary Contract which       
provides an annuity payment option. The new annuitization date must be any      
contract anniversary on or before the maximum annuitization date.               

Annuity payment options                                                         
-----------------------                                                         
You may choose from several fixed annuity payment options. Payments will be made
on the frequency you choose. You may elect to have your annuity payments made on
a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual basis. The dollar amount of the      
payments is specified for the entire payment period according to the option     
selected. There is no right to make any total or partial surrender after the    
annuity payments start.                                                         

The amount of the annuity payment depends on:                                   
.. amount of accumulated value;                                                 
.. option selected; and                                                         
.. age of annuitant (unless fixed income option is selected).                   

Annuity payments generally are higher for male annuitants than for female       
annuitants with an otherwise identical contract. This is because statistically  
females have longer life expectancies than males. In certain states, this       
difference may not be taken into consideration in fixing the payment amount.    
Additionally, contracts with no gender distinctions are made available for      
certain employer-sponsored plans because under most such plans, such contract   
provisions are prohibited by law.                                               

You may select an annuity payment option or change a previous selection by      
written request. We must receive the request on or before the annuitization     
date. You may not change your annuity payment option or make division transfers 
after the annuitization date.                                                   

Payments under the annuity payment options are made as of the first day of each 
payment period beginning with the annuitization date. The available annuity     
payment options are:                                                            
.. FIXED INCOME. Payments of a fixed amount or payments for a fixed period of at
least five years but not more than 30 years. Payments stop after all        
guaranteed payments are made.                                               
.. LIFE INCOME. Payments are made as of the first day of each payment period    
  during the annuitant's life, starting with the annuitization date. No payments
 are made after the annuitant dies. It is possible that you would only receive
 one payment under this option if the annuitant dies before the second payment
 is due. If you die after the payments begin and before the end of the minimum
guaranteed period (if applicable), the remaining payments are made to the   
beneficiary named under your annuity payment option.                        
.. JOINT AND SURVIVOR LIFE INCOME. Payments are made during the life of the     
annuitant and joint annuitant, continuing until the death of the survivor.  
 This option includes a minimum guaranteed period of 10 years. If both persons
die before the end of the minimum guaranteed period, the remaining payments 
are made to the beneficiary under your annuity payment option.              
.. JOINT AND TWO-THIRDS SURVIVOR LIFE INCOME. Payments continue as long as either
the annuitant or the joint annuitant is alive. If either the annuitant or   
joint annuitant dies, payments continue to the survivor at two-thirds the   
original amount. Payments stop when both the annuitant and joint annuitant  
have died. It is possible that only one payment is made under this option if
both annuitants die before the second payment is due.                       
.. OTHER ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS MAY BE AVAILABLE WITH OUR APPROVAL.            

If you do not select an annuity payment option, your accumulated value will be  
applied as follows to determine the annuity payment:                            
.. life income with a ten year guarantee; or                                    
.. if there are joint annuitants, joint and survivor life income with a ten year
guarantee.                                                                  

In order to avoid tax penalties, payments from at least one of your qualified   
contracts must start no later than April 1 following the calendar year in which 
you turn age 70 1/2. The required minimum payment is a distribution in equal (or

P-->485APOS22nd�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
substantially equal) amounts over your life or over the joint lives of you and  
your designated beneficiary(ies). In addition, payments must be made at least   
once a year. Tax penalties may also apply at your death on certain excess       
accumulations. You should consider potential tax penalties with your tax advisor
when selecting an annuity payment option or taking other distributions from the 
Contract.                                                                       

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS 

A mortality and expense risks charge and in some circumstances a transaction fee
and state premium taxes are deducted under the Contract. A surrender charge (on 
surrenders) and a transfer fee (on transfers to divisions) may also be deducted 
from certain withdrawals from the Fixed Account made before the annuitization   
date. We reserve the right to assess a daily Separate Account administration    
charge or state premium taxes. There are also deductions from and expenses paid 
out of the assets of the underlying mutual funds which are described in the     
underlying mutual funds' prospectuses. Other than the Annual Fee (which we do   
not expect to generate a profit), we expect a profit from the fees and charges  
listed below.                                                                   

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISKS CHARGE 
We assess each division with a daily charge for mortality and expense risks. The
annual rate of the charge is 0.85% of the average daily net assets of the       
Separate Account. We reserve the right to increase this charge but guarantee    
that it will not exceed 1.25% per year. This charge is assessed only prior to   
the annuitization date. This charge is assessed daily when the value of an      
accumulation unit is calculated.                                                

We have a mortality risk in that we guarantee payment of a death benefit in a   
single sum or under an annuity payment option. No surrender charge is imposed on
a death benefit payment which gives us an additional mortality risk.            

The expense risk that we assume is that the actual expenses incurred in issuing 
and administering the Contract exceed the Contract limits on administrative     
charges.                                                                        

If the mortality and expense risks charge is not enough to cover the costs, we  
bear the loss. If the amount of mortality and expense risks charge deducted is  
more than our costs, the excess is profit to the Company.                       

PREMIUM TAXES 
We reserve the right to deduct an amount to cover any premium taxes imposed by  
states or other jurisdictions. Any deduction is made from either a purchase     
payment when we receive it, or the accumulated value when you request a         
surrender (total or partial) or it is applied under an annuity payment option.  
Currently, premium taxes range from zero to 3.5%.                               

FIXED ACCOUNT SURRENDER CHARGE AND TRANSFER FEE 
No sales charge is collected or deducted when purchase payments are applied     
under the Contract to provide an annuity payment option. A surrender charge is  
assessed on certain total or partial surrenders from the Fixed Account. The     
amounts we receive from the surrender charge are used to cover some of the      
expenses of the sale of the Contract (commissions and other promotional or      
distribution expenses). If the surrender charge collected is not enough to cover
the actual costs of distribution, the costs are paid from the Company's General 
Account assets which will include profit, if any, from the mortality and expense
risks charge.                                                                   

The surrender charge for any total or partial surrender is a percentage of the  
Fixed Account purchase payments surrendered which were received by us during the
seven contract years prior to the surrender. The applicable percentage which is 
applied to the sum of the Fixed Account purchase payments (which includes       
amounts transferred to the Fixed Account from any of the divisions) paid during 
each contract year is determined by the following table.

The Fixed Account transfer fee is assessed on certain transfers from the Fixed  
Account to the Separate Account (For contracts sold in South Carolina, the Fixed
Account transfer fee is waived).

* Includes amounts transferred to Fixed Account from divisions. Each Fixed  
 Account purchase payment begins in year 0 for purposes of calculating the
percentage applied to that payment.                                     

For purposes of calculating surrenders and transfers, we assume that surrenders 
and transfers are made in the following order*:                                 
.. first from Fixed Account purchase payments we received more than seven       
completed contract years prior to the surrender (or transfer);              
.. then from the Fixed Account free transaction amount (first from the Fixed    
Account's earnings, then from the oldest Fixed Account purchase payments    
(first-in, first-out)) described below; and                                 
.. then from Fixed Account purchase payments we received within the seven       
completed contract years before the surrender (or transfer) on a first-in,  
first-out basis.                                                            
* The order for tax reporting purposes is different. You should consult your
tax advisor.                                                            

Where permitted by state law, we reserve the right to reduce:                   
.. the surrender charge fee for any amounts surrendered from this Contract;     
and/or                                                                      
.. transfer fees on amounts transferred from the Fixed Account to the Separate  
Account.                                                                    
These reductions would apply to Contracts that are attributable to a conversion 
from other products issued by the Company and its subsidiaries and as otherwise 
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (as amended).                   

For Contracts sold in Massachusetts:                                            
.. There is no transfer fee on purchase payments allocated to the Fixed Account 
after the 13th contract year.                                               
.. There is no surrender charge on purchase payments allocated to the Fixed

WAIVER OF FIXED ACCOUNT SURRENDER CHARGE                                        
The Fixed Account Surrender Charge will not apply to:                           
.. amounts applied under an annuity payment option; or                          
.. payment of death benefit, however, the Surrender Charge does apply to premium
payments made by surviving spouse after an owner's death; or                
.. amounts distributed to satisfy the minimum distribution requirement of Section
401(a)9 of the Code (applies to qualified Contracts only); or               
.. amounts transferred, after the seventh contract year, from the Contract to a 
single premium immediate annuity issued by the Company; or                  
.. any amount transferred from a Contract used to fund another annuity contract

made under a divorce decree; or                                             

Waiver of Fixed Account Surrender Charge Rider                                  
----------------------------------------------                                  
This rider is automatically made a part of the Contract at issue. There is no   
charge for the rider. This rider waives the surrender charge on surrenders made 
after the first contract anniversary if the original owner original annuitant   
has a critical need. Waiver of the surrender charge is available for critical   
need if the following conditions are met:                                       
.. original owner or original annuitant has a critical need;                    

P-->485APOS24th�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
.. the critical need did not exist before the contract date.                    
.. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:           
. critical need - owner's or annuitant's confinement to a health care       
  facility, terminal illness diagnosis or total and permanent disability. If
   the critical need is confinement to a health care facility, the confinement

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE 
We reserve the right to assess each division with a daily charge at the annual  
rate of 0.15% of the average daily net assets of the division. This charge would
only be imposed before the annuitization date. This charge would be assessed to 
help cover administrative expenses. Administrative expenses include the cost of 
issuing the Contract, clerical, record keeping and bookkeeping services, keeping
the required financial and accounting records, communicating with Contract      
owners and making regulatory filings.                                           

SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR GROUP OR SPONSORED ARRANGEMENTS 
Where permitted by state law, Contracts may be purchased under group or         
sponsored arrangements as well as on an individual basis.                       

GROUP ARRANGEMENT - program under which a trustee, employer or similar entity 
purchases Contracts covering a group of individuals on a group basis.         

SPONSORED ARRANGEMENT - program under which an employer permits group         
solicitation of its employees or an association permits group solicitation of 
its members for the purchase of Contracts on an individual basis.             

The charges and deductions described above may be reduced or eliminated for     
Contracts issued in connection with group or sponsored arrangements. The rules  
in effect at the time the application is approved will determine if reductions  
apply. Reductions may include but are not limited to sales of Contracts without,
or with reduced, mortality and expense risks charges, annual fees,              
administrative charge, the cost of insurance or surrender charges.              

Availability of the reduction and the size of the reduction (if any) is based on
certain criteria.                                                               

Eligibility for and the amount of these reductions are determined by a number of
factors, including the number of individuals in the group, the amount of        
expected purchase payments, total assets under management for the Contract      
owner, the relationship among the group's members, the purpose for which the    
Contract is being purchased, the expected persistency of the Contract, and any  
other circumstances which, in our opinion are rationally related to the expected
reduction in expenses. Reductions reflect the reduced sales efforts and         
administrative costs resulting from these arrangements. We may modify the       
criteria for and the amount of the reduction in the future. Modifications will  
not unfairly discriminate against any person, including affected Contract owners
and other contract owners with contracts funded by the Separate Account.

FIXED ACCOUNT 

This prospectus is intended to serve as a disclosure document only for the      
Contract as it relates to the Separate Account. It only contains selected       
information regarding the Fixed Account. More information concerning the Fixed  
Account is available from the annuity service office or from a sales            
representative.                                                                 

You may allocate purchase payments and transfer amounts from the Separate       
Account to the Fixed Account. Assets in the Fixed Account are held in the       
General Account of the Company. Because of exemptive and exclusionary           
provisions, interests in the Fixed Account are not registered under the         
Securities Act of 1933 and the General Account is not registered as an          
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Fixed Account  
is not subject to these Acts. The staff of the Commission does not review the   
prospectus disclosures relating to the Fixed Account. However, these disclosures
are subject to certain generally applicable provisions of the federal securities
laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in the        
prospectus.                                                                     

GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
Our obligations with respect to the Fixed Account are supported by the Company's
General Account. The General Account is the assets of the Company other than    
those allocated to any of the Company's Separate Accounts. Subject to applicable
law, the Company has sole discretion over the assets in the General Account.    

The Company guarantees that purchase payments allocated to the Fixed Account    
earn interest at a guaranteed interest rate. In no event will the guaranteed    
interest rate be less than 3% compounded annually.                              

Each purchase payment allocated or amount transferred to the Fixed Account earns
interest at the guaranteed rate in effect on the date it is received or         
transferred. This rate applies to each purchase payment or amount transferred   
through the end of the contract year.                                           

Each contract anniversary, we declare a renewal interest rate that is guaranteed
and applies to the Fixed Account value in existence at that time. This rate     
applies until the end of the contract year. Interest is earned daily and        
compounded annually at the end of each contract year. Once credited, the        
interest is guaranteed and becomes part of the accumulated value in the Fixed   
Account from which deductions for fees and charges may be made.                 

FIXED ACCOUNT ACCUMULATED VALUE                                                 
Your Contract's Fixed Account accumulated value on any valuation date is the sum
of:                                                                             
.. purchase payments allocated to the Fixed Account;                            
.. plus any transfers to the Fixed Account from the Separate Account;           
.. plus interest credited to the Fixed Account;                                 
.. minus any surrenders, surrender charges, or transaction fees allocated to the
Fixed Account;                                                              
.. minus any transfers (and transfer fees) to the Separate Account.             

FIXED ACCOUNT TRANSFERS, TOTAL AND PARTIAL SURRENDERS 
Transfers and surrenders from your investment in the Fixed Account are subject  
to certain limitations. In addition, surrenders and transfers from the Fixed    
Account may be subject to a charge or fee (see Fixed Account Surrender Charge   
and Transfer Fee). The total amount you may transfer and/or surrender from the  
Fixed Account may not exceed your Fixed Account value.                          

You may transfer amounts from the Fixed Account to the divisions before the     
annuitization date and as provided below. The transfer is effective on the      
valuation date following our receiving your instructions. You may transfer      
amounts by making either a scheduled or unscheduled Fixed Account transfer. You 
may not make both a scheduled and unscheduled Fixed Account transfer in the same
contract year.                                                                  

Fixed Account Free Transaction Amount                                           
-------------------------------------                                           
Each contract year, a certain portion of your Fixed Account value may be:       
.. withdrawn free of the surrender charge; or                                   
.. transferred to the Separate Account free of the transfer fee.                

P-->485APOS26th�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
The surrender charge and transfer fee do not apply to Fixed Account surrenders  
or transfers (or a combination of surrenders and transfers) which do not exceed 
the greater of:                                                                 
.. your Fixed Account's earnings (Fixed Account value minus                     
  unsurrendered/non-transferred Fixed Account purchase payments still subject to
a surrender charge or transfer fee); or                                     
.. 10% of your total Fixed Account value recalculated as of the later of the    
contract date or last contract anniversary; or                              
.. an amount surrendered to satisfy the minimum distribution requirement of     
Section 401(a)9 of the Code, provided that the amount surrendered does not  
 exceed the minimum distribution amount which would have been calculated based
on the value of this Contract alone.                                        
In addition, 10% of Fixed Account purchase payments during the current Contract 
year may be surrendered without a surrender charge or transferred without a     
transfer fee.                                                                   

Unscheduled Fixed Account Transfer                                              
----------------------------------                                              
You may make an unscheduled transfer from the Fixed Account each contract year  
as follows:                                                                     
.. The transfer is effective on the valuation date following our receiving your 
instructions.                                                               
.. You must specify the dollar amount or percentage to be transferred.          
.. Amounts in excess of the Fixed Account Free Transaction Amount may be subject
to a transfer fee.                                                          
.. You may transfer up to 100% of your Fixed Account value (without incurring the
transfer fee) within 30 days after a contract anniversary if:               
. your Fixed Account value is less than $1,000, or                          
. the renewal interest rate for your Fixed Account value for the current    
contract year is more than one percentage point lower than the weighted 
average of your Fixed Account interest rates for the preceding contract 
year.                                                                   
  . If you do not meet one of the preceding conditions, transfers from the Fixed
 Account may be subject to a surrender charge (see Fixed Account Surrender
Charge and Transfer Fee).                                               

Scheduled Fixed Account Transfer (Dollar Cost Averaging)                        
--------------------------------------------------------                        
You may make scheduled transfers on a periodic basis from the Fixed Account as  
follows:                                                                        
.. Transfers occur on a date you specify (other than the 29th, 30th or 31st of  
any month).                                                                 
.. If the selected date is not a valuation date, the transfer is completed on the
next valuation date.                                                        
.. The minimum transfer amount is $50.                                          
.. Transfers continue until your value in the Fixed Account is zero or we receive
your notice to stop them.                                                   
.. If you stop the transfers, you may not start them again without our prior    
approval.                                                                   

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

TELEPHONE AND INTERNET SERVICES 
Telephone services and internet services are permitted (unless prohibited by    
state law) for both changes in the allocation of future purchase payments and   
transfers among divisions.                                                      

Neither the Company nor the Separate Account are responsible for the            
authenticity of telephone service transaction requests. We reserve the right to 
refuse telephone service transaction requests. You assume the risk of loss      
caused by fraudulent telephone service transactions we reasonably believe to be 
genuine. We follow procedures in an attempt to assure genuine telephone service 
transactions. If these procedures are not followed, then we may be liable for   
loss caused by unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. The procedures include  
recording telephone service transactions, requesting personal identification    
(name, daytime telephone number, social security number and/or birthdate) and   
sending written confirmation to your address of record.                         

Telephone Services                                                              
------------------                                                              
Telephone services may be declined on the Contract application or at any later  
date by providing us with written notice. Telephone services are used by calling
us at 1-800-852-4450. If the Contract is owned by a business entity or trust, an
                      ----------------------------------------------------------
authorized individual (with the proper Password) may use these services and     
---------------------------------------------------------------------------     
provide us with instructions.                                                   
-----------------------------                                                   

Telephone instructions must be made while we are open for business. They are    
effective when received by us before the close of normal trading of the New York
Stock Exchange (generally 3 p.m. Central Time). Requests received when          

P-->485APOS27th�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
we are not open for business or after the New York Stock Exchange closes its    
normal trading will be effective on the next valuation date.                    

We reserve the right to modify or terminate telephone service transaction       
procedures at any time.                                                         

Internet Services                                                               
-----------------                                                               
Internet access is available for you at www.principal.com. For security         
purposes, you need a personal identification number (Password) to use any of the
new Internet services, including viewing your policy information online. If you 
don't have a Password, you can obtain one at www.principal.com. If the Contract 
                                                               ---------------
is owned by a business entity or trust, an authorized individual (with the      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------      
proper Password) may use these services and provide us with instructions.       
-------------------------------------------------------------------------       

We reserve the right to modify or terminate internet service transaction        
procedures at any time.                                                         

THE CONTRACT 
The entire Contract is made up of: applications, amendments, riders and         
endorsements attached to the Contract; current data page; copies of any         
supplemental applications, amendments, endorsements and revised Contract pages  
or data pages which are mailed to you. Only our corporate officers can agree to 
change or waive any provisions of a Contract. Any change or waiver must be in   
writing and signed by an officer of the Company.                                

DELAY OF PAYMENTS 
Surrenders are generally made within seven days after we receive your           
instruction for a surrender in a form acceptable to us. This period may be      
shorter where required by law. However, payment of any amount upon total or     
partial surrender, death, annuitization of the accumulated value or the transfer
to or from a division may be deferred during any period when the right to sell  
mutual fund shares is suspended as permitted under provisions of the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 (as amended).                                               

The right to sell shares may be suspended during any period when:               
.. trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted as determined by the    
Commission or when the Exchange is closed for other than weekends and       
holidays, or                                                                
.. an emergency exists, as determined by the Commission, as a result of which:  
. disposal by a mutual fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably     
practicable;                                                            
. it is not reasonably practicable for a mutual fund to fairly determine the
value of its net assets; or                                             
. the Commission permits suspension for the protection of security holders. 

If payments are delayed and your surrender, annuitization or transfer is not    
canceled by your written instruction, the amount to be surrendered, annuitized  
or transferred will be determined the first valuation date following the        
expiration of the permitted delay. The surrender will be made within seven days 
thereafter.                                                                     

In addition, payments on surrenders (or transfers) attributable to a purchase   
payment made by check may be delayed up to 15 days. This permits payment to be  
collected on the check.                                                         

We may also defer payment of surrender proceeds payable out of the Fixed Account
for a period of up to six months.                                               

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR GENDER 
If the age or, where applicable, gender of the annuitant has been misstated, we 
adjust the income payable under your Contract to reflect the amount that would  
have been payable at the correct age and gender. If we make any overpayment     
because of incorrect information about age or gender, or any error or           
miscalculation, we deduct the overpayment from the next annuity payment or      
annuity payments due. Underpayments are added to the next annuity payment.      

ASSIGNMENT 
You may assign your non-qualified Contract. Each assignment is subject to any   
payments made or action taken by the Company prior to our notification of the   
assignment. We assume no responsibility for the validity of any assignment. An  
assignment or pledge of a Contract may have adverse tax consequences.           

P-->485APOS28th�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
An assignment must be made in writing and filed with us at the annuity service  
office. The irrevocable beneficiary(ies), if any, must authorize any assignment 
in writing. Your rights, as well as those of the annuitant and beneficiary, are 
subject to any assignment on file with us. Any amounts paid to an assignee are  
treated as a partial surrender and is paid in a single lump sum.                

CHANGE OF OWNER 
You may change your ownership designation at any time (this does not apply to   
IRAs or IRA rollovers). Your request must be in writing and approved by us.     
After approval, the change is effective as of the date you signed the request   
for change. We reserve the right to require that you send us the Contract so    
that we can record the change.                                                  

BENEFICIARY 
Before the annuitization date, you have the right to name a beneficiary. This   
may be done as part of the application process or by sending us a written       
request. Unless you have named an irrevocable beneficiary, you may change your  
beneficiary designation by sending us a written request. A joint annuitant may  
not be named as a beneficiary.                                                  

CONTRACT TERMINATION 
We reserve the right to terminate the Contract and make a single sum payment    
(without imposing any charges) to you if your accumulated value at the end of   
the accumulation period is less than $5,000. Before the Contract is terminated, 
we will send you a notice to increase the accumulated value to $5,000 within 60 
days. Termination of the Contract will not unfairly discriminate against any    
owner.                                                                          

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES                                          
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering      
activities, Federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and  
record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When you   
open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other   
information that will allow us to verify your identity. We may also ask to see  
your driver's license or other identifying documents.                           

If concerns arise with verification of your identification, no transactions,    
will be permitted while we attempt to reconcile the concerns. If we are unable  
to verify your identity within 30 days of our receipt of your initial purchase  
payment, the account(s) will be closed and redeemed in accordance with normal   
redemption procedures.                                                          

RIGHTS RESERVED BY THE COMPANY 

We reserve the right to make certain changes if, in our judgement, they best    
serve the interests of you and the annuitant or are appropriate in carrying out 
the purpose of the Contract. Any changes will be made only to the extent and in 
the manner permitted by applicable laws. Also, when required by law, we will    
obtain your approval of the changes and approval from any appropriate regulatory
authority. Approvals may not be required in all cases. Examples of the changes  
the Company may make include:                                                   

.. transfer assets in any division to another division or to the Fixed Account; 
.. add, combine or eliminate divisions in the Separate Account; or              
.. substitute the units of a division for the units of another division:        
. if units of a division are no longer available for investment; or         
. if in our judgement, investment in a division becomes inappropriate       
considering the purposes of the Separate Account.                       

FREQUENT TRADING AND MARKET-TIMING (ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES) 
This Contract is not designed for frequent trading or market timing activity of 
the investment options. If you intend to trade frequently and/or use market     
timing investment strategies, you should not purchase this Contract.            

We consider frequent trading and market timing activities to be abusive trading 
practices because they:                                                         
.. Disrupt the management of the underlying mutual funds by;                    
. forcing the fund to hold short-term (liquid) assets rather than investing 
    for long term growth, which results in lost investment opportunities for the
fund; and                                                               

P-->485APOS29th�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
. causing unplanned portfolio turnover;                                     
.. Hurt the portfolio performance of the underlying mutual funds; and           
.. Increase expenses of the underlying mutual fund and separate account due to; 
. increased broker-dealer commissions; and                                  
. increased recordkeeping and related costs.                                

We have adopted policies and procedures to help us identify and prevent abusive 
trading practices. In addition, the underlying mutual funds monitor trading     
activity to identify and take action against abuses. While our policies and     
procedures are designed to identify and protect against abusive trading         
practices, there can be no certainty that we will identify and prevent abusive  
trading in all instances. When we do identify abusive trading, we will apply our
policies and procedures in a fair and uniform manner.                           

If we, or an underlying mutual fund that is an investment option with the       
Contract, deem abusive trading practices to be occurring, we will take action   
that may include, but is not limited to:                                        
.. Rejecting transfer instructions from a Contract owner or other person        
authorized by the owner to direct transfers;                                
.. Restricting submission of transfer requests by, for example, allowing transfer
requests to be submitted by 1/st/ class U.S. mail only and disallowing      
requests made via the internet, by facsimile, by overnight courier or by    
telephone;                                                                  
.. Limiting the number of unscheduled transfer during a Contract year to no more
than 12;                                                                    
.. Requiring a holding period of a minimum of thirty days before permitting     
transfers among the divisions where there is evidence of at least one       
round-trip transaction by the owner; and                                    
.. Taking such other action as directed by the underlying mutual fund.          

The underlying mutual funds have reserved the right to accept or reject, without
prior written notice, any transfer requests.                                    

In some instances, a transfer may be completed prior to a determination of      
abusive trading. In those instances, we will reverse the transfer and return the
Contract to the investment option holdings it had prior to the transfer. We will
give you notice in writing in this instance.                                    

DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACT 

The individuals who sell the Contract are authorized to sell life and other     
forms of personal insurance and variable annuities. Though it is sold primarily 
by insurance agents who are employees of the Company, the Contract may also be  
offered by insurance agents or brokers who are not our employees but who are    
appointed by us to sell variable annuities. Our employees who sell the Contract 
are also registered representatives of Princor Financial Services Corporation,  
Principal Financial Group, Des Moines, Iowa 50392-2080. Princor is a            
broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. When the Contract is    
sold by our employees, as the principal underwriter, Princor is paid 1.35% of   
purchase payments by the Company for the distribution of the Contract. Princor  
is also the principal underwriter for various registered investment companies   
organized by the Company. Princor is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of   
the Company.                                                                    

In addition to being sold by our employees, the Contract may be offered through 
other registered representatives of Princor and registered representatives of   
other selected broker-dealers. Such broker-dealers are either registered under  
the Securities Exchanges Act of 1934 or are exempt from such registration. When 
the Contract is sold by other than our employees, as the principal underwriter, 
Princor is paid 1.50% of purchase payments by the Company for the distribution  
of the Contract.                                                                

PERFORMANCE CALCULATION 

The Separate Account may publish advertisements containing information          
(including graphs, charts, tables and examples) about the performance of one or 
more of its divisions. The Contract was not offered prior to April 30, 1999.    
However, shares of Accounts in which certain divisions of the Separate Account  
invest were offered prior to that date. The Separate Account may publish        
advertisements containing information about the hypothetical performance of one 
or more of its divisions for this Contract as if the Contract had been issued on
or after the date the mutual fund in which                                      

P-->485APOS30th�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
the division invests was first offered. The hypothetical performance from the   
date of the inception of the mutual fund in which the division invests is       
calculated by reducing the actual performance of the underlying mutual fund by  
the fees and charges of this Contract as if it had been in existence.           

Other divisions of the Separate Account were not offered until April 30, 1999.  
Performance data for these divisions are calculated utilizing standardized      
performance formulas and shows performance since the inception date of the      
division.                                                                       

The yield and total return figures described below vary depending upon market   
conditions, composition of the underlying mutual fund's portfolios and operating
expenses. These factors and possible differences in the methods used in         
calculating yield and total return should be considered when comparing the      
Separate Account performance figures to performance figures published for other 
investment vehicles. The Separate Account may also quote rankings, yields or    
returns as published by independent statistical services or publishers and      
information regarding performance of certain market indices. Any performance    
data quoted for the Separate Account represents only historical performance and 
is not intended to indicate future performance. For further information on how  
the Separate Account calculates yield and total return figures, see the SAI.    

From time to time the Separate Account advertises its Money Market Division's   
"yield" and "effective yield" for these Contracts. Both yield figures are based 
on historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance. The 
"yield" of the division refers to the income generated by an investment in the  
division over a 7-day period (which period is stated in the advertisement). This
income is then "annualized." That is, the amount of income generated by the     
investment during that week is assumed to be generated each week over a 52-week 
period and is shown as a percentage of the investment. The "effective yield" is 
calculated similarly but, when annualized, the income earned by an investment in
the division is assumed to be reinvested. The "effective yield" is slightly     
higher than the "yield" because of the compounding effect of the assumed        
reinvestment.                                                                   

In addition, the Separate Account advertises the "yield" for other divisions for
the Contract. The "yield" of a division is determined by annualizing the net    
investment income per unit for a specific, historical 30-day period and dividing
the result by the ending maximum offering price of the unit for the same period.

The Separate Account also advertises the average annual total return of its     
various divisions. The average annual total return for any of the divisions is  
computed by calculating the average annual compounded rate of return over the   
stated period that would equate an initial $1,000 investment to the ending      
redeemable Contract value.                                                      

VOTING RIGHTS 

The Company votes shares of the underlying mutual funds held in the Separate    
Account at meetings of shareholders of those mutual funds. It follows your      
voting instructions if you have an investment in the corresponding division.    

The number of shares in which you have a voting interest is determined by your  
investment in the division as of a "record date." The record date is set by the 
mutual fund within the requirements of the laws of the state which govern that  
mutual fund. The number of shares held in Separate Account B attributable to    
your interest in each division is determined by dividing the value of your      
interest in that division by the net asset value of one share of the mutual     
fund. Shares for which owners are entitled to give voting instructions, but for 
which none are received, and shares of the mutual fund owned by the Company are 
voted in the same proportion as the total shares for which voting instructions  
have been received.                                                             

Voting materials are provided to you along with an appropriate form that may be 
used to give voting instructions to the Company.                                

If the Company determines pursuant to applicable law that mutual fund shares    
held in Separate Account B need not be voted pursuant to instructions received  
from owners, then the Company may vote mutual fund shares held in Separate      
Account B in its own right.                                                     

FEDERAL TAX MATTERS 

The following description is a general summary of the tax rules, primarily      
related to federal income taxes, which in our opinion are currently in effect.  
These rules are based on laws, regulations and interpretations which are subject
to                                                                              

P-->485APOS31st�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
change at any time. This summary is not comprehensive and is not intended as tax
advice. Federal estate and gift tax considerations, as well as state and local  
taxes, may also be material. You should consult a qualified tax adviser about   
the tax implications of taking action under a Contract or related retirement    
plan.                                                                           

NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS 
Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation of annuities in general.            
.. Purchase payments made under non-qualified Contracts are not excludible or   
deductible from your gross income or any other person's gross income.       
.. An increase in the accumulated value of a non-qualified Contract resulting   
 from the investment performance of the Separate Account or interest credit to
the Fixed Account is generally not taxable until paid out as surrender      
proceeds, death benefit proceeds, or otherwise.                             
.. Generally, owners who are not natural persons are immediately taxed on any   
increase in the accumulated value.                                          

The following discussion applies generally to Contracts owned by natural        
persons.                                                                        
.. Surrenders or partial surrenders are taxed as ordinary income to the extent of
the accumulated income or gain under the Contract.                          
.. The value of the Contract pledged or assigned is taxed as ordinary income to 
the same extent as a partial surrender.                                     
.. Annuity payments:                                                            
. The investment in the Contract is generally the total of the purchase     
payments made.                                                          
. The portion of the annuity payment that represents the amount by which the
accumulated value exceeds the investment in the Contract is taxed as    
ordinary income. The remainder of each annuity payment is not taxed.    
. After the investment in the Contract is paid out, the full amount of any  
annuity payment is taxable.                                             

For purposes of determining the amount of taxable income resulting from         
distributions, all Contracts and other annuity contracts issued by us or our    
affiliates to the same owner within the same calendar year are treated as if    
they are a single contract.                                                     

A transfer of ownership of a Contract, or designation of an annuitant or other  
payee who is not also the owner, may result in a certain income or gift tax     
consequences to the owner. If you are contemplating any transfer or assignment  
of a Contract, you should contact a competent tax advisor with respect to the   
potential tax effects of such transactions.                                     

REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS FOR NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS 
In order for a non-qualified Contract to be treated as an annuity contract for  
federal income tax purposes, the Code requires:                                 
.. If the person receiving payments dies on or after the annuitization date but 
prior to the time the entire interest in the Contract has been distributed, 
the remaining portion of the interest is distributed at least as rapidly as 
under the method of distribution being used as of the date of that person's 
death.                                                                      
.. If you die prior to the annuitization date, the entire interest in the       
Contract will be distributed:                                               
. within five years after the date of your death; or                        
 . as annuity payments which begin within one year of your death and which are
made over the life of your designated beneficiary or over a period not  
extending beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary.               
.. If you take a distribution from the Contract before you are 59 1/2, you may  
incur an income tax penalty.                                                

If your designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the Contract may be    
continued with your spouse deemed to be the new owner for purposes of the Code. 
Where the owner or other person receiving payments is not a natural person, the 
required distributions provided for in the Code apply upon the death of the     
annuitant.                                                                      

Generally, unless the beneficiary elects otherwise, the above requirements are  
satisfied prior to the annuitization date by paying the death benefit in a      
single sum, subject to proof of your death. The beneficiary may elect by written
request to receive payment under an annuity payment option instead of a lump sum
payment. However, if the election is not made within 60 days of the date the    
single sum death benefit otherwise becomes payable, the IRS may disregard the   
election for tax purposes and tax the beneficiary as if a single sum payment had
been made.                                                                      

P-->485APOS32nd�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
IRA 
The Contract may be used to fund IRAs. The tax rules applicable to owners,      
annuitants and other payees vary according to the type of plan and the terms and
conditions of the plan itself. In general, purchase payments made under a       
retirement program recognized under the Code are excluded from the participant's
gross income for tax purposes prior to the annuitization date. The portion, if  
any, of any purchase payment made that is not excluded from their gross income  
is their investment in the Contract. Aggregate deferrals under all plans at the 
employee's option may be subject to limitations.                                

If you are purchasing this Contract to fund a tax-qualified retirement plan     
(IRA, SEP, SIMPLE IRA), you should be aware that this tax deferral feature is   
available with any qualified investment vehicle and is not unique to an annuity.
This Contract provides additional benefits such as lifetime income options,     
death benefit protection and guaranteed expense levels. Carefully consider the  
features and benefits of the variable annuity in making the decision to purchase
it.                                                                             

The tax implications of these plans are further discussed in the SAI under the  
heading Taxation Under Certain Retirement Plans. Check with your tax advisor for
the rules which apply to your specific situation.                               

With respect to IRAs or IRA rollovers, there is a 10% penalty under the Code on 
the taxable portion of a "premature distribution." Generally, an amount is a    
"premature distribution" unless the distribution is:                            
.. made on or after you reach age 59 1/2;                                       
.. made to a beneficiary on or after your death;                                
.. made upon your disability;                                                   
.. part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life
expectancy of you or you and the beneficiary;                               
.. made to pay medical expenses;                                                
.. for certain unemployment expenses;                                           
.. for first home purchases (up to $10,000); or                                 
.. for higher education expenses.                                               

ROLLOVER IRAS                                                                   
If you receive a lump-sum from a pension or profit sharing plan or tax-sheltered
annuity, you may maintain the tax-deferred status of the money by rolling into a
"Rollover Individual Retirement Annuity." Generally distributions from a        
qualified plan are subject to mandatory income tax withholding at a rate of 20%,
unless the participant elects a direct rollover. You have 60 days from receipt  
of the money to complete this transaction. If you choose not to reinvest or go  
beyond the 60-day limit and are under age 59 1/2, you will incur a 10% IRS      
penalty as well as income tax expenses.                                         

WITHHOLDING 
Annuity payments and other amounts received under the Contract are subject to   
income tax withholding unless the recipient elects not to have taxes withheld.  
The amounts withheld vary among recipients depending on the tax status of the   
individual and the type of payments from which taxes are withheld.              

Notwithstanding the recipient's election, withholding may be required on        
payments delivered outside the United States. Moreover, special "backup         
withholding" rules may require us to disregard the recipient's election if the  
recipient fails to supply us with a "TIN" or taxpayer identification number     
(social security number for individuals), or if the Internal Revenue Service    
notifies us that the TIN provided by the recipient is incorrect.                

MUTUAL FUND DIVERSIFICATION 
The United States Treasury Department has adopted regulations under Section     
817(h) of the Code which establishes standards of diversification for the       
investments underlying the Contracts. Under this Code Section, Separate Account 
investments must be adequately diversified in order for the increase in the     
value of non-qualified Contracts to receive tax-deferred treatment. In order to 
be adequately diversified, the portfolio of each underlying mutual fund must, as
of the end of each calendar quarter or within 30 days thereafter, have no more  
than 55% of its assets invested in any one investment, 70% in any two           
investments, 80% in any three investments and 90% in any four investments.      
Failure of a mutual fund to meet the diversification requirements could result  
in tax liability to non-qualified Contract holders.                             

P-->485APOS33rd�"Page"�of�46TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
The investment opportunities of the mutual funds could conceivably be limited by
adhering to the above diversification requirements. This would affect all       
owners, including owners of Contracts for whom diversification is not a         
requirement for tax-deferred treatment.                                         

STATE REGULATION 

The Company is subject to the laws of the State of Iowa governing insurance     
companies and to regulation by the Insurance Department of the State of Iowa. An
annual statement in a prescribed form must be filed by March 1 in each year     
covering our operations for the preceding year and our financial condition on   
December 31 of the prior year. Our books and assets are subject to examination  
by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa, or the Commissioner's    
representatives, at all times. A full examination of our operations is conducted
periodically by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Iowa law   
and regulations also prescribe permissible investments, but this does not       
involve supervision of the investment management or policy of the Company.      

In addition, we are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of other      
states and jurisdictions where we are licensed to operate. Generally, the       
insurance departments of these states and jurisdictions apply the laws of the   
state of domicile in determining the field of permissible investments.          

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             
RESERVATION RIGHTS                                                              
The Company reserves the right to:

published by independent statistical services or publishers and information     
regarding performance of certain market indices. Any performance data quoted for
the Separate Account represents historical performance and is not intended to   
indicate future performance.                                                    

From time to time the Account advertises its Money Market division's "yield" and
"effective yield" for the Contract. Both yield figures are based on historical  
earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance. The "yield" of the
division refers to the income generated by an investment under the contract in  
the division over a seven-day period (the period will be stated in the          
advertisement). This income is then "annualized." That is, the amount of income 
generated by the investment during that week is assumed to be generated each    
week over a 52-week period and is shown as a percentage of the investment. The  
"effective yield" is calculated similarly but, when annualized, the income      
earned by an investment in the division is assumed to be reinvested. The        
"effective yield" is slightly higher than the "yield" because of the compounding
effect of this assumed reinvestment. Neither yield quotation reflects a sales   
load deducted from purchase payments which, if included, would reduce the       
"yield" and "effective yield." For the period ended December 31, 2004, the 7-day
annualized and effective yields were 0.91% and 0.90%, respectively.             

In addition, the Separate Account advertises the "yield" for certain other      
divisions for the Contract. The "yield" of a division is determined by          
annualizing the net investment income per unit for a specific, historical 30-day
period and dividing the result by the ending maximum offering price of the unit 
for the same period. This yield quotation does not reflect a contingent deferred
sales charge which, if included, would reduce the "yield." No contingent        
deferred sales charge is assessed on investments in the Separate Account        
divisions of the Contract.                                                      

The Separate Account also advertises the average annual total return of its     
various divisions. The average annual total return for any of the divisions is  
computed by calculating the average annual compounded rate of return over the   
stated period that would equate an initial $1,000 investment to the ending      
redeemable contract value.                                                      

Following are the hypothetical average annual total returns for the period ended
December 31, 2004 assuming the Contract had been offered as of the effective    
dates of the underlying Mutual Funds in which the divisions invest:

TAXATION UNDER CERTAIN RETIREMENT PLANS 
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES                                                 
Contributions. Individuals may make contributions for individual retirement     
annuity (IRA) contracts. Individuals may make deductible contributions (for any 
year) up to the lesser of the amount shown in the chart or 100% of compensation.

Individuals age 50 or over are also permitted to make additional "catch-up"     
contributions. The additional contribution is $500 through 2005 and $1,000 in   
2006 and beyond.                                                                

Such individuals may establish a traditional IRA for a non-working spouse. The  
annual contribution for both spouses' contracts cannot exceed the lesser of the 
amount shown in the chart or 100% of the working spouse's compensation. No more 
than the individual IRA limit may be contributed to either spouse's IRA for any 
year.

Starting in 2009, limits are indexed for cost-of-living.                        

Contributions may be tax deductible. If an individual and his/her spouse do not 
participate in a qualified retirement plan, the contributions to an IRA are     
fully tax deductible regardless of income. If an individual is an active        
participant in a qualified retirement plan, his/her ability to deduct the       
contributions depends upon his/her income level.                                

For individuals who are not active participants but whose spouses are,          
deductibility of traditional IRA contributions is phased out if the couple's    
Adjusted Gross Income is between $150,000 and $160,000; assuming taxes are filed
jointly.

An individual may make non-deductible IRA contributions to the extent of the    
excess of:                                                                      

1) The lesser of maximum annual contribution or 100% of compensation, over      

2) The IRA deductible contributions made with respect to the individual.        

An individual may not make any contribution to his/her own IRA for the year in  
which he/she reaches age 70 1/2 or for any year thereafter.

Taxation of Distributions. Distributions from IRA Contracts are taxed as        
ordinary income to the recipient, although special rules exist for the tax-free 
return of non-deductible contributions. In addition, taxable distributions      
received under an IRA Contract prior to age 591/2 are subject to a 10% penalty  
tax in addition to regular income tax. Certain distributions are exempted from  
this penalty tax, including distributions following the owner's death or        
disability if the distribution is paid as part of a series of substantially     
equal periodic payments made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Owner or  
the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of Owner and the Owner's designated
Beneficiary; distributions to pay medical expenses; distributions for certain   
unemployment expenses; distributions for first home purchases (up to $10,000)   
and distributions for higher education expenses.                                

Required Distributions. Generally, distributions from IRA Contracts must        
commence not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year
in which the owner attains age 701/2, and such distributions must be made over a
period that does not exceed the uniform life distribution period established by 
the IRS. A penalty tax of 50% would be imposed on any amount by which the       
minimum required distribution in any year exceeded the amount actually          
distributed in that year. In addition, in the event that the owner dies before  
his or her entire interest in the Contract has been distributed, the owner's    
entire interest must be distributed in accordance with rules similar to those   
applicable upon the death of the Contract Owner in the case of a non-qualified  
Contract, as described in the Prospectus.                                       

Tax-Free Rollovers. The Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") permits the taxable  
portion of funds to be transferred in a tax-free rollover from a qualified      
employer pension, profit-sharing, annuity, bond purchase or tax-deferred annuity
plan to an IRA Contract if certain conditions are met, and if the rollover of   
assets is completed within 60 days after the distribution from the qualified    
plan is received. A direct rollover of funds may avoid a 20% federal tax        
withholding generally applicable to qualified plans or tax-deferred annuity plan
distributions. In addition, not more frequently than once every twelve months,  
amounts may be rolled over tax-free from one IRA to another, subject to the     
60-day limitation and other requirements. The once-per-year limitation on       
rollovers does not apply to direct transfers of funds between IRA custodians or 
trustees.

Contributions. Under Section 408(k) of the Code, employers may establish a type

contributions to a SEP cannot exceed the amounts in the chart below.

Employees of certain small employers may have contributions made to the salary  
reduction simplified employee pension plan (SAR/SEP) on their behalf on a salary
reduction basis. The amount that an employee chooses to defer and contribute to 
the SAR/SEP is referred to as an elective deferral.                             

These elective deferrals are subject to the same cap as elective deferrals to   
IRC Section 401(k) plans, see table below. In addition to the elective          
deferrals, SAR/SEP may permit additional elective deferrals by individuals age  
50 or over, referred to as "catch-up contributions."                            

No new SAR/SEP are permitted after 1996 for any employer, but those in effect   
prior to 1997 may continue to operate, receive contributions, and add new       
employees.                                                                      

Employees of tax-exempt organizations and state and local government agencies   
are not eligible for SAR/SEPs.

of IRA plan known as a SIMPLE IRA. Employees may have contributions made to the 
SIMPLE IRA on a salary reduction basis. The amount that an employee chooses to  
defer and contribute to the SIMPLE IRA is referred to as an elective deferral.  

These elective deferrals cannot exceed the amounts shown in the chart. In       
addition to the elective deferrals, SIMPLE IRA may permit additional elective   
deferrals by individuals age 50 or over, referred to as "catch-up               
contributions".                                                                 

Elective contribution amounts made under the salary reduction portions (i.e.,   
those subject to the elective deferral limits shown below) of a SIMPLE IRA plan 
are counted in the overall limit on elective deferrals by any individual. For   
example in 2005, an individual under age 50 who defers the maximum of $10,000 to
a SIMPLE IRA of one employer and participates in a 401(k) plan of another       
employer would be limited to an elective deferral of $4,000 in 2005 ($14,000 -  
$10,000) to the 401(k) plan.                                                    

The employer generally must match either 100% of the employee's elective        
deferral, up to 3% of the employee's compensation or fixed nonelective          
contributions of 2% of compensation.

Taxation of Distributions. Generally, distribution payments from SIMPLE IRAs are
subject to the same distribution rules described above for IRAs, except that    
distributions made within two years of the date of an employee's first          
participation in a SIMPLE IRA of an employer are subject to a 25% penalty tax   
instead of the 10% penalty tax discussed previously.                            

Required Distributions. SIMPLE IRAs are subject to the same minimum required    
distribution rules described above for IRAs.                                    

Tax-Free Rollovers. Direct transfers may be made among SIMPLE IRAs in the same  
manner as described above for IRAs, subject to the same conditions and          
limitations. Rollovers from SIMPLE IRAs are permitted after two years have      
elapsed from the date of an employee's first participation in a SIMPLE IRA of   
the employer. Rollovers to SIMPLE IRAs from other plans are not permitted.

2 Internal Voya statistics, as of December 31, 2014.
* Important Information:  Voya StabilizerSM is offered through a group annuity contract issued by Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (VRIAC). Stability of principal is the primary objective of this investment option. Voya's StabilizerSM guarantees a minimum rate of interest and may credit a higher interest rate from period to period. The credited interest rate is subject to change, up or down, but will never fall below the guaranteed minimum. The guarantees provided by the contract are based on the claims-paying ability of VRIAC. The assets are held in a separate account and are “insulated” from claims arising out of any other business conducted by VRIAC and can be used only for the benefit of plan participants.  Withdrawals resulting from employer-initiated events, such as withdrawals following mass layoffs, employer bankruptcy or full or partial plan may be restricted. Your stable value account balance is not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), by any other government agency or by your plan. This portfolio is not a registered investment under the 1940 Act and has not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of the individual issuing insurance company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its policies.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
