Larry was a most carrying leader and a role model in his leadership role at the Institutes. I will always value his dedication for his employees and that helped bring professionalism into the insurance industry.  A most remarkable, dedicated and personable CEO. His wonderful family and his devoted wife, Dutchie, brought him much happiness, including his best friend Woody!  Take care Larry.  You will be missed but never forgotten.  Nancy Panati
