				Vision Capital Management, Inc is a full service design-build company in the Sacramento area. As owners of VCM Bo and I have been building custom homes for 30 years and our number one goal has always been to deliver the highest quality turn-key product, on time and on budget. Working together with our dedicated team of professionals - architect, engineers, draftsmen and sub-contractor base - we have designed and built over 130 custom home projects in the Sacramento area. We are are extremely passionate about every aspect of home building, from designing the perfect floor plan to meet the specific needs of our clients and elevations that remain true to the style and character of the home as well as the quality of construction and craftsmanship. Our time tested bidding process and value based engineering have enabled us to provide accurate and budget sensitive bids so there is no second guessing the cost of your project. No one wants surprises along the way - least of all us. We offer complimentary full design services to all our clients and our Project Management team works diligently with our clients to keep the project moving on schedule and on budget at all times. In 1994 Bo became actively involved in the development of “The Residences at Granite Bay Golf Club” and was a key member of the Architectural Review Board. Under our previous company name, JBS Construction, we designed and built 16 custom homes in the 52 unit gated neighborhood. Our state-of-the-art architectural designs earned us the recognition and respect among fellow contractors and real estate professionals as the first builder to cultivate “Old World European” style homes within the community. As a result, “The Residences” has been consistently credited as one of the highest valued neighborhoods in Placer County.If we had to sum up our company in five words or less they would be:- Integrity- Passion- Quality- Knowledge- TransparencyWe look forward to meeting with you to discuss your custom home project!Mandy SnellProject Manager and Design ConsultantVision capital Management , Inc(916) 765-2880mandy@visioncapitalmgmt.com

What is a design-build firm?Design-build firms take on the responsibilities of architects, contractors and construction companies, all under one roof. These full-service firms focus on a streamlined design-build process — from the initial design to the estimating phase to physical construction — in the hope of creating an efficient experience for both the client and the company. Because the entire project is happening within one company, Sacramento design-build firms are able to overlap the design and construction phases of the project, which often speeds up the project significantly. In addition, these firms work to minimize risks for the project owner through single-point responsibility contracts. However, depending on the firm, you may still want to contact an interior designer or architect to help create the exact look you want. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of design-build firms: Interior Designers & Decorators, Landscape Architects & Landscape Designers, Architects & Building Designers, Photographers.Before deciding on a residential design-and-build company in Sacramento, CA, think about what you want from your new home. Do you want a large kitchen for entertaining? Do you need several bedrooms for children and guests? Do you want a finished basement for extra space or storage? Look for Sacramento design-builders that specialize in the areas you're looking for. Budget is obviously a determining factor in the outcome of your project. To make sure you stay within your means, consider making a must-have list and a wish list. Gauge where the estimates are falling to determine which design-build contract can realistically strike the balance between the two.Questions to ask a prospective Sacramento design-builder: How long have you been in the design-build construction business? How many projects like mine have you completed? Who will be working on the project? Are the workers employees or subcontractors? Can you provide me with references? Who is your designer, and what are his or her qualifications? Are your employees licensed and insured? How do you charge, and what does that include? Can you give me a written estimate? What do your services include? When can this job get done? What happens when cost exceeds the budget? What about changes to materials or labor pricing? What will I need to provide? Are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this project?Find a Sacramento design-build company on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section of the website to design-build firms in Sacramento, CA. You may also look through Sacramento, CA photos to find a pool you like, then contact the design-build firm that created it. You can find more design-build firms in Roseville, Elk Grove, Arden-Arcade, Citrus Heights and Davis. Professional Categories in Sacramento

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Sacramento, CA professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Sacramento, CA portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Sacramento, CA professional for more information.

Education

For someone who didn’t have a clue she’d end up in this business, Courtney sure found her calling. She’s fascinated by the psychology of money and is motivated to help her clients feel confident in making financial decisions. She also cares a lot about grammar and seems to be oddly at ease at networking events. Despite 5 knee surgeries, she loves playing just about every sport and hanging with Dexter, her Wire Fox Terrier.
