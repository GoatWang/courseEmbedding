Investment Management – Chesley Taft & Associates



















































 







Personalized Portfolio Construction 
Achieving our client’s financial goals is dependent on our understanding their personal/family situation, financial resources, tax status, and risk tolerance. We translate that understanding into a unique and comprehensive portfolio plan. We work with our client’s other trusted advisors to coordinate their investment, financial, tax, and estate planning strategies.
Our role in the investment plan may involve equity, fixed income, or balanced management. Whether we are called on for managing a specific asset class or the entire portfolio, we will review the plan regularly and make changes as necessary should circumstances change or the market environment shift.



Disciplined Investment Process
Buying
We apply a three-pronged investment process whether we are investing in fixed income or equity. While our focus is on finding good investments regardless of industry or sector, we do look at the overall economic and credit environments to assess our portfolio construction. This analysis also guides our exploration of new ideas and helps us identify future prospective investments. We use a variety of research sources and supplement that with our own investigations and analysis.

Selling
Purchasing securities is only half of the process. Selling is critical. We are careful not to over-react but we do monitor trading and valuation trends that may be precursors of negative news. Just as importantly, we monitor the portfolio and sell holdings as needed to maintain portfolio diversification. Sell decisions are triggered by:

Negative changes in fundamentals which reduces a company’s or issuer’s long-term earnings ability such as a deterioration in the issuer’s financial position
Extraordinary events, such as a merger, which we believe will negatively alter a company’s performance
Significant changes in the valuation of the asset





Our Equity Selection Process
Our equity portfolios are well diversified with a tilt toward growth stocks. We have found that portfolios based on companies with consistent earnings best fit the long-term goals of our clients. We are looking for investments not trades. We select stocks with reasonable market valuations based on their anticipated earnings prospects and patterns of strong earnings and revenue growth.
We particularly focus on:

Historical sales and earnings growth
Stability of earnings
Return on equity
Debt to total market capitalization

In evaluating specific stocks, we rely on our own analysis based on the collective experience and varying perspectives of our portfolio managers, as well as third party research and research provided by major Wall Street firms.
We look at various technical and valuation measures. One such measure is the PEG ratio. This measure compares the price/earnings ratio to the expected growth rate of the company. If the PEG ratio is too high a stock may be overvalued relative to its future growth.
We often supplement our individual stock holdings with exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds to broaden exposure or more efficiently access certain investment themes.

Our Fixed Income Selection Process
Criteria is established for each client based on the portfolio goals, risk profile and tax bracket. The structure of the portfolio is then adjusted based on our evaluation of current and expected interest rates taking into account economic conditions such as monetary policy, fiscal policy, economic strength, and inflation.
Depending on whether we are structuring a portfolio of taxable securities or municipal bonds, we select securities that meet the quality and maturity criteria established for the individual client portfolio. We also use exchange-traded funds or mutual funds to gain exposure to specific market segments when we deem it beneficial to the client.
Just as with our equity portfolios, the sell discipline is critical to long-term success. We monitor the credit quality of our holdings. If there is significant deterioration of the credit quality, we will assess the long-term implications and respond accordingly. We will also, where appropriate, make adjustments to the portfolio duration and quality structure based on changes in market conditions or client circumstances.

Investment Commentary – Chesley Taft & Associates



















































 







Read about the latest thinking from our portfolio managers pertaining to our business.


2017 First Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, April 12, 2017
During the first quarter of this year, stocks continued their upward march, to the surprise of many investors.  The S & P 500 Stock Index was up 6.1%, although performance across various sectors of the market was quite uneven.  While the S & P Technology Index was up 10.2%, and the Health Care Index up 7.9%, the S&P Energy Index was down 7.2%.

PerspectivesBy Joan M. Giardina, February 9, 2017
Never in the past forty years have I experienced a time when the political climate so dominated the investment discourse and my discussions with you, my clients. For those forty years one axiom has held true. The economy matters, not politics. Even politicians mostly know that. This time feels different. It isn’t.

2016 Fourth Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, January 6, 2017
Once again the equity markets surprised investors, with the Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock Index rising 11.96% for the calendar year 2016. All the more surprising, since pundits were unanimous in the opinion that a Trump election victory would result in a sharp market decline.

Trump – Where Do We Go from Here?By Brian Zavalkoff, November 9, 2016
It goes without saying that the results of last night’s election were surprising. Not only did it seem unlikely that Donald Trump would win the election, the possibility that the Republicans would end up controlling the Presidency, Senate and the House was really not even on the radar.

2016 Third Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, October 7, 2016
The third quarter of the year was a volatile one, as the equity markets contemplated the impact of Federal Reserve action or inaction and election consequences.  These important issues provided plenty of uncertainty to foster investor concern.  However, in spite of these issues the Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock Index was up 3.3% for the quarter and 6.1% for the year to date.  This was indeed, a strong performance, considering the circumstances.

2016 Second Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, July 18, 2016
In 1974, while walking through a gallery in Evanston, I purchased a lithograph by Salvador Dali.  The subject was a bull fight.  The matador is depicted standing over the bull. The bull is full of picks, bleeding at the mouth, on his front knees, but not dead.  The bull had not given up the fight.

2016 First Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, April 12, 2016
We ended the first quarter of 2016 “back where we started.” Stocks were about unchanged with the S & P 500 Stock Index up 0.8% and short term interest rates little changed. Getting “back where we started,” however, was a roller coaster ride for stocks, as the S & P 500 declined 13% and then recovered.

A Brief Market Comment - China and the Markets By Brian Zavalkoff, January 7, 2016
A client asked me today if I was nervous about the markets. I am not sure nervous would be the right word. I am annoyed though and somewhat cautious. That said, my comments about the full year do still stand.

2015 Year in Review and 2016 Market Outlook By Brian Zavalkoff, January 4, 2016
If you paid absolutely no attention to U.S. financial markets in 2015, you might think that it was a rather uneventful year. 

2015 Year in Review By William A. Goldstein, January 4, 2016
It is amazing! Six years of rising stock prices and so little optimism.  Since the stock market low of March 2009 (6469.95 for the Dow Jones Industrial Average), stocks have been in a generally rising trend, ending 2015 at 17425.03.

2015 Third Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, October 9, 2015
Concern about interest rates and their impact on earnings, currencies and global economic growth dominated the headlines and contributed to stock and bond market volatility during the third quarter. 

Market UpdateBy Joan M. Giardina, August 25, 2015
There is no question that the stock market is, in the vernacular, correcting.  After hitting new highs in May, the momentum has gone from relatively stable to outright drop.

2015 Second Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, July 15, 2015
Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire burn and caldron bubble.

A Brief Note on the Markets - China, Greece and the U.S. ImpactBy Brian Zavalkoff, July 8, 2015
Over the last few weeks, volatility has increased substantially in the global equity markets. I thought I would send a brief note discussing the two major culprits, Greece and China, as well as the ramifications for the U.S. markets and economy.

2015 First Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, April 10, 2015
During the past quarter, the S & P 500 Stock Index rose a modest .4% but marked the ninth consecutive quarterly increase.  Perhaps the lackluster market performance is a result of somewhat disappointing earnings by large global companies due to foreign exchange conversion.  

2014 Year in Review By William A. Goldstein, January 7, 2015
“Bulls make money.  Bears make money.  Pigs get slaughtered.”  This old Wall Street adage comes to mind, as we end 2014 with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index up 13.7% following a 32.4% increase in 2013.

2014 Year in Review and 2015 Market Outlook By Brian Zavalkoff, January 6, 2015
2014 turned out to be a very solid year for investors and the economy – if your sole focus was the United States. The truth is that 2014 was a year of great disparity. The greater your focus on the United States, the better that you performed.

Comments Regarding Recent Stock Market VolatilityBy Brian Zavalkoff, October 11, 2014
Over the last three months, stock market gyrations have picked up substantially culminating with this week producing the largest weekly market decline (S&P 500 -3.1%) since May of 2012. I thought it might be timely to provide some perspective as to what has been driving the markets and what, if anything, should be done about it.

2014 Third Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, October 9, 2014
Stocks provided a modest return of 1.3% for the third quarter as measured by the S&P Index, while the year to date return has been 8.3%.  

2014 Second Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, July 11, 2014
What is the likelihood of a major stock market correction?   This is an often asked, but not unreasonable question.

2014 First Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, April 10, 2014
What are you worried about?  That is the question we are asked most often.

2013 Year End ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, January 5, 2014
2013 was a remarkable year for investors, as U. S. stock market indices reached all-time highs.  It does not seem that long since 2009, when the cover of “Business Week” proclaimed the death of stocks and many said equities and the U. S. economy would not recover for decades.
2013 Year in Review and 2014 Market OutlookBy Brian Zavalkoff, January 3, 2014
2013 proved to be another very interesting year. Investors entered 2013 concerned that rising tax rates and a potential government shutdown would put a halt to a still fledgling economic recovery.

2013 Third Quarter ReviewBy William A. Goldstein, October 1, 2013
The third quarter of 2013 was another good quarter for stocks.  The Standard & Poor 500 Stock index increased 5.2% during the quarter and 19.79% for the year through September 30th.

The Taper that Wasn’t - On to Government Shutdown?By Brian Zavalkoff, September 19, 2013
Well, yesterday was a little bit of a surprise. After four months of prepping the markets for the beginning of tapering (slowing down Federal Reserve purchase of government bonds), the Federal Reserve elected to defer the tapering process for a little while.

Why the stock market has done so well this year, and a brief comment on the sequester        By Brian Zavalkoff, March 7, 2013
The stock markets have certainly started the year on a strong note with the S&P 500 up over 8% year-to-date and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting an all-time high. After several years of a market crisis mentality, there is much skepticism in the market place as to the rationality and sustainability of the stock market’s rise.

 Educational Background



 
Class of 1961 


Purdue University

                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.
