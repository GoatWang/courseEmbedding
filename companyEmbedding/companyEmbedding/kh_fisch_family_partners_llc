A partner in the Real Estate Department, Peter Fisch regularly represents developers, entrepreneurial investors, institutional investors, lenders and other parties in all aspects of transactional real estate, including acquisitions and dispositions, joint ventures, conventional and securitized financings, workouts, sale-leasebacks, management contracts and leasing, involving a balance of office, retail, hotel, multifamily, industrial and student housing properties and commercial condominium regimes.
Peter’s work has earned him recognition as a leading Real Estate lawyer by both The Legal 500 and Chambers USA. He has published more than 35 articles regarding new developments in real estate transactional law in prominent trade publications, including the Real Estate Finance Journal and the National Law Journal, and co-authors a regular column on transactional real estate law for the New York Law Journal. Peter has also brought his considerable experience to programs and panels sponsored by the New York City Bar Association and other prestigious organizations. His discussions have covered real estate financings, joint ventures, observations regarding market conditions and other related topics.
Peter recently completed two terms as a member of the Board of Directors of the Yale Law School Fund.
