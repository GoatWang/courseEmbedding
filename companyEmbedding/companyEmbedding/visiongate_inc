The Cell-CT platform, using a process called optical projection tomography, produces isometric, sub-micron resolution 3D images of individual cells with the ability to morphologically recognize over 700 structural biomarkers of normal and abnormal cells.  VisionGate is developing the Cell-CT platform to improve its ability to identify biosignatures that would classify cells to aid in abnormal cell detection and prediction of disease.   The Cell-CT platform can process any liquid biopsy specimen. As such, it has the potential to detect a wide range of different cancers and cancer biosignatures.  This could aid in identifying potential treatments using targeted pharmaceutical therapies.Our LuCED® lung test is a non-invasive sputum-based test that detects abnormal cells which indicate lung cancer and lung dysplasia.  The LuCED test utilizes the Cell-CT platform and is in development for the early detection of lung cancer, bronchial dysplasia, and the assessment of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPN).  The LuCED test includes our proprietary CellGazer™ application, an imaging software tool under development to facilitate cytopathology diagnosis of abnormal cell images detected by the Cell-CT platform.Our lead investigative pharmaceutical product is iloprost and it is currently in clinical development. Our aim is to achieve the reduction of moderate to severe lung dysplasia as measured by the LuCED lung test, and to qualify iloprost as a first-in-class lung cancer chemoprevention treatment.  Iloprost, an oral prostacyclin analog, has progressed through an NCI-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial and demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in bronchial dysplasia1.In 2016 VisionGate® acquired a worldwide exclusive license to use iloprost for the prevention of cancer.  Iloprost importantly extends the VisionGate product portfolio beyond the LuCED lung test into potential chemoprevention with an oncology pharmaceutical therapeutic.  The LuCED® lung test is being developed as a companion diagnostic to iloprost and to provide the unique ability to identify patients with lung dysplasia, a pre-cancerous condition.1Oral Iloprost Improves Endobronchial Dysplasia in Former Smokers, Keith et.al., Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2011 Jun; 4(6): 793–802  Related PagesManagement TeamBoard of DirectorsMedical Advisory BoardStrategic AdvisorsCollaboratorsThis website may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and made in reliance on the "safe harbor" provisions of said act.

Intellectual Property SummaryThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted the Company’s most fundamental patents covering the LuCED® lung test and all components of the LuCED test including the automated 3D imaging platform.  Our lead investigative pharmaceutical product iloprost for the prevention of lung cancer also has patent and other intellectual property protections.  VisionGate intellectual property portfolio includes over 164 patents in 12 countries and the European Patent Office (comprising 38 member states), and more than 16 patents pending. VisionGate’s Notable Issued U.S. Patents (Sampling)United States Patent No. 6,770,893Aug. 3, 2004METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY USING TEMPORAL SIGNATURES Inventor: Alan C. Nelson An optical tomographic system is described wherein the localization of secondary emitters within an object of interest can be determined using the temporal signatures of secondary emission arising from the object being illuminated by an external primary source beam that is non-parallel, such as a cone beam, while said beam is moving relative to the object in a controlled manner. A unique set of secondary emitter points can be localized within the object and, when combined with a computed reconstruction of the object from its primary beam projections, can accurately create an image of the secondary emitters in the object. The system would enable the quantitative three-dimensional imaging of fluorescently labeled molecular probes in a biological cell, for example. (20 Claims) United States Patent No. 6,519,355Feb. 11, 2003OPTICAL PROJECTION IMAGING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY DETECTING CELLS HAVING NUCLEAR AND CYTOPLASMIC DENSITOMETRIC FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE Inventor: Alan C. Nelson A system and method for rapidly detecting cells of interest using multi-dimensional, highly quantitative, nuclear and cytoplasmic densitometric features (NDFs and CDFs) includes a flow optical tomography (FOT) instrument capable of generating various optical projection images (or shadowgrams) containing accurate density information from a cell, a computer and software to analyze and reconstruct the projection images into a multi-dimensional data set, and automated feature collection and object classifiers. The system and method are particularly useful in the early detection of cancers such as lung cancer using a bronchial specimen from sputum or cheek scrapings and cervical/ovarian cancer using a cervical scraping; the system can be used to detect rare cells in specimens including blood. (34 claims) United States Patent No. 7,738,945June 15, 2010OPTICAL IMAGING OF A THICK SPECIMEN Inventor: Mark E. Fauver A system for optical imaging of a thick specimen that permits rapid acquisition of data necessary for tomographic reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) image. One method involves the scanning of the focal plane of an imaging system and integrating the range of focal planes onto a detector. The focal plane of an optical imaging system is scanned along the axis perpendicular to said plane through the thickness of a specimen during a single detector exposure. Secondly, methods for reducing light scatter when using illumination point sources are presented. Both approaches yield shadowgrams. This process is repeated from multiple perspectives, either in series using a single illumination/detection subsystem, or in parallel using several illumination/detection subsystems. A set of pseudo-projections is generated, which are input to a three dimensional tomographic image reconstruction algorithm. United States Patent No. 7,907,765March 15, 2011FOCAL PLANE TRACKING FOR OPTICAL MICROTOMOGRAPHY Inventors: Mark E. Fauver and Alan C. Nelson An optical tomography system comprising: a light source for illuminating an object of interest with a plurality of radiation beams; an object containing tube, wherein when the object of interest is held within the object containing tube it is illuminated by the plurality of radiation beams to produce emerging radiation from the object containing tube; an objective lens, having an optical axis, for scanning the object at a set of viewing angles to generate a set of pseudoprojection images from the emerging radiation, where each pseudoprojection image is produced by integrating a series of images from a series of focal planes integrated along the optical axis for each angle; a detector array located to receive the set of pseudoprojection images; and means for tracking the object of interest responsively to the imaging data, wherein the tracking means comprises means for tracking a pseudoprojection image center. United States Patent No. 6,636,623Oct. 21, 2003OPTICAL PROJECTION IMAGING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AUTOMATICALLY DETECTING CELLS WITH MOLECULAR MARKER COM-PARTMENTALIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH MALIGNANCY AND DISEASE Inventors: Alan C. Nelson, Robert W. Webster and Chee-Wui Chu A system and method for rapidly detecting cells associated with malignancy and disease using molecular marker compartmentalization includes an optical tomography (OT) or a flow optical tomography (FOT) instrument capable of producing various optical projection images (or shadowgrams) containing accurate density information from a cell or cells labeled with tagged molecular probes or stains, a computer and software to analyze and reconstruct the projection images into a multi-dimensional data set, and automated feature collection and object classifiers. The system and method are particularly useful in the early detection of cancers such as lung cancer using cells from sputum or cheek scrapings and cervical/ovarian cancer using a cervical scraping, and the system can be used to detect rare cells in specimens including blood. (32 Claims) United States Patent No. 7,197,355Mar. 27, 2007VARIABLE-MOTION OPTICAL TOMOGRAPHY OF SMALL OBJECTS Inventor: Alan C. Nelson A method for variable-motion optical tomography (VOT), where motion of an object of interest, such as a cell, has a variable velocity that can be varied on a cell-by-cell basis. Cell velocity is controlled in one example by packing cells into a capillary tube, or any other linear substrate, so that the cells are stationary within the capillary tube, but the capillary tube is translated and rotated mechanically through an optical tomography reconstruction cylinder. The capillary tube motion may advantageously be controlled in a start-and-stop fashion and translated and rotated at any velocity for any motion interval, under the control of a computer program. (26 Claims) United States Patent No. 6,697,508Feb. 24, 2004TOMOGRAPHIC RECONSTRUCTION OF SMALL OBJECTS USING A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE Inventor: Alan C. Nelson A system and method for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of a cell includes adjusting a current set of projection images according to a set of a priori knowledge to produce adjusted projection images, for example, based on probability masks and/or Bayesian analysis of multiple similar objects in the same sample. A reconstruction algorithm processes the adjusted projection images to generate a 3D image. The 3D image is further adjusted according to at least one set of a priori knowledge to generate an adjusted 3D image. Criteria for process completion are applied to determine whether the adjusted 3D image is adequate. Otherwise, a set of pseudo projections are computationally created at the same projection angles as the current set of projection images and then compared to the current set of projection images to produce a set of new projections, wherein the new projections are input again to the reconstruction algorithm and the steps of the method are repeated until the adequacy criteria are met. (22 Claims) United States Patent No. 6,591,003July 8, 2003OPTICAL TOMOGRAPHY OF SMALL MOVING OBJECTS USING TIME DELAY AND INTEGRATION IMAGING Inventors: Chee-Wui Chu and Alan C. Nelson A system and method for three-dimensional reconstruction of an object of interest moving at a constant velocity. The object of interest is centered. The object of interest is imaged with optical point sources located at multiple projection angles around the object of interest, in cooperation with opposing time delay and integration (TDI) image sensors located at a distance from the objects of interest such that there is no focal plane within the objects of interest during imaging. Each of the TDI sensors has a line transfer rate synchronized to the constant velocity of the objects of interest. (20 Claims) United States Patent No. 6,944,322Sept. 13, 2005OPTICAL TOMOGRAPHY OF SMALL OBJECTS USING PARALLEL-BEAM ILLUMINATION AND POST-SPECIMEN OPTICAL MAGNIFICATION Inventors: Roger H. Johnson and Alan C. Nelson An optical tomography (OT) system utilizing parallel-beam illumination is disclosed. Detectors are utilized in several projection imaging geometries to obtain multi-perspective data for tomographic image reconstruction of small objects such as biological cells. Magnification is controlled by post-specimen optics. The method permits the optimal use of parallel-beam back projection image reconstruction methods. (56 Claims) United States Patent No. 7,260,253Aug. 21, 2007METHOD FOR CORRECTION OF RELATIVE OBJECT-DETECTOR MOTION BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE VIEWS Inventors: J. Richard Rahn and Alan C. Nelson An apparatus and method for correction of relative object-detector motion between successive views during optical tomographic imaging in three dimensions. An object of interest is illuminated to produce an image. A lateral offset correction value is determined for the image. An axial offset correction value is determined for the image. The lateral offset correction value and the axial offset correction value are applied to the image to produce a corrected file image.

Patients screened with x-ray low dose CT were 20% less likely to die from lung cancer compared with standard chest x-ray. Annual screening by x-ray low dose CT has the potential to detect lung cancers in their earliest stage, when survival is most promising. The study, while positive, also showed that low-dose CT scans tend to have a high false positive rate – an area for improvement where VisionGate is focused.A major milestone for lung cancer screening, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) approved reimbursing low-dose CT scans in a high-risk group of patients (ages 55-77 who have smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years) in February 2015, issuing instructions for submitting claims in October 2015 to start accepting claims in January 2016.About LuCED® Lung TestThe LuCED lung test does not use radiation. Rather, it uses a sputum sample that can be collected through spontaneous coughs over a three-day period using a take-home test kit. Samples collected using our LuCED test kits are shipped to the VisionGate Biosignatures Laboratory (VBL) and then samples are processed on our proprietary Cell-CT technology. The first automated 3D cell imaging platform, this revolutionary technology computes sub-micron resolution biosignatures from intact cells. Cell classifiers then automatically identify abnormal cells in sputum.

However, according to statistics from the American Cancer Society, lung cancer survival is better with earlier diagnosis. Our mission at VisionGate is to have a positive impact and save lives using our LuCED&reg lung test to help find lung cancer at an early stage – when treatment options are more effective.VisionGate’s LuCED lung test is being developed for future availability through our CLIA laboratory to aid physicians in early detection of lung cancer. The LuCED lung test requires a sputum sample that can be collected from spontaneous coughs over a three-day period using a take-home kit that the patient receives from your office.Patients then ship the LuCED test kits to the VisionGate Biosignature Laboratories (VBL) where samples are processed on our proprietary Cell-CT™ platform. The Cell-CT platform is the world’s first automated 3D cell imaging platform that computes high-resolution biosignatures from intact cells. The LuCED test classifies the cells as normal or abnormal. Our licensed cytologists then screen the images followed by a review by our pathologist and a sign out of the case as normal or abnormal. Those results are sent to the ordering physician within two to four weeks.VisionGate was founded by Dr. Alan Nelson, a physicist, bioengineer and entrepreneur who previously developed the world’s first automated screening test to detect cervical cancer, marketed today as the FocalPoint system by Becton Dickinson.The LuCED lung test is not yet available to the public, but please enter your name and email in the form to the right and we’ll notify you as soon as it is! Or, please call 602.354.8862 to request a presentation on out LuCED test.Below are some Frequently Asked Questions:Who is at the highest risk for lung cancer?The Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS) recently ruled that it would cover low-dose CT scans for individuals aged 55-77 who smoke or have smoked at least one pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years.What is the LuCED® lung test? What will the results mean?The LuCED® lung test is a non-invasive test to aid physicians in the early detection of lung cancer. The VBL will generate a “normal” or “abnormal” report to you as the physician, which could help determine the next steps in the diagnosis of lung cancer.Does the LuCED lung test subject patients to radiation?No, absolutely no radiation is used in the LuCED test. The sputum sample can be collected at home and shipped to the VBL in Phoenix, Arizona.What is the sputum collection process like for my patients?The LuCED lung test requires a sputum sample that can be collected over three days using VisionGate’s take-home test kit that the patient receives from your office.How long will it take to receive patient test results?Once the patient’s sample arrives at VBL, please allow approximately 2 to 4 weeks for processing.To whom will the results be reported?VisionGate will send test results directly to the ordering physician. It is then the physician’s responsibility to discuss these results with the patient and determine next steps.How do I obtain the test for my patients?Once the test becomes available, you can call 602.354.8862 or email info@visiongate3d.com to order kits.Do third-party payers cover the test?The LuCED lung test is a new innovative test using proprietary technology. While there is a current CPT code for sputum cytology, many insurance companies have not yet established a formal coverage policy for the LuCED lung test. Any costs not covered by insurance will be the responsibility of the patient.How do I request a presentation on the LuCED® test or ask additional questions not currently available on this website?Please contact the VisionGate Biosignature Laboratories, open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 602.354.8862.

VisionGate Inc. Company Profile

01:24 EDT 25th July 2017 | BioPortfolio











      VisionGate, Inc. is led by Dr. Alan Nelson, physicist, bioengineer and 
      entrepreneur who developed the worldâs first and only automated 
      screening test to detect cervical cancer, marketed today as FocalPoint 
      by Becton Dickinson. VisionGate produces the first automated 3D cell 
      imaging platform, the Cell-CT, which computes high-resolution 3D 
      biosignatures from intact cells. The companyâs first product is the 
      LuCED test, which incorporates the Cell-CT, and is initially being 
      deployed as a CLIA lab developed test (LDT) for adjunctive use with low 
      dose x-ray computed tomography (LDCT) screening. Adjunctive use of LuCED 
      to better manage the high rate of false positive results in LDCT 
      screening could increase the utility and cost effectiveness of the 
      approach, which has been shown to decrease lung cancer deaths in 
      high-risk patients. VisionGate is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, and 
      has a research and development facility in Seattle, Washington. It 
      currently holds 124 issued patents.

PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VisionGate, Inc., a next generation biotech company that has developed a 
      revolutionary, non-invasive test for the early detection of lung cancer, 
      delivered results of its blinded clinical study yesterday evening at the 
      16th World Conference on Lung Cancer being held September 
      6-9, 2015, at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver, Colo.
    


      VisionGate’s blinded clinical study of the proprietary LuCED® 
      test included 84 patients, and demonstrated 92% sensitivity to lung 
      cancer and 98% specificity. “When validated in larger trials, we are 
      cautiously optimistic that this clinical performance would position 
      LuCED as a lung cancer screening tool, with the ability to serve 
      populations beyond the highest-risk patients who meet CMS guidelines,” 
      VisionGate Founder and Chief Executive Officer Alan Nelson, PhD said.
    

      More than half the people with lung cancer die within one year after 
      being diagnosed, according to the American Lung Association. Described 
      as the “Deadliest Cancer Worldwide,” symptoms of lung cancer do not 
      appear until the disease is already in an advanced, non-curable stage.
    

      Spontaneously produced sputum from 36 patients with biopsy confirmed 
      lung cancer, and 48 patients who were understood to be cancer free, 
      eight of whom suffered from either COPD or emphysema, were included in 
      the study. The LuCED test generated 3D cell image data for blinded 
      cytology review. From this review, 33/36 cancer cases were found to have 
      abnormal cells yielding 92% sensitivity. For the normal cases, 47 cases 
      had no abnormal cells, for an estimated 98% specificity. Importantly, 
      this equates to a Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 99.9% in a 
      population with 1% incidence of lung cancer. VisionGate has begun to 
      conduct large-scale clinical studies to strengthen LuCED’s clinical 
      evidence and is pursuing FDA clearance through a national multi-center 
      trial.
    

      “The data from our blinded trial is compelling. We are encouraged – now 
      more than ever – that we are developing a cost-effective solution for 
      detecting lung cancer early,” Nelson said. “This is a test, which after 
      validation in prospective trials, will complement lung cancer screening 
      for the diagnosis of indeterminate nodules seen on the CT scans, and 
      perhaps aid in early detection of the disease in high risk individuals.”
    

      VisonGate’s LuCED test is a physician-ordered, non-invasive take-home 
      test that collects sputum samples for lung cancer analysis. LuCED 
      harnesses the power of proprietary optics and computational technology 
      with the capability to generate 3D images of each cell in a sputum 
      sample. It then automatically analyzes cells to identify key features, 
      or biosignatures, associated with malignancy. This approach should also 
      enable LuCED to identify dysplasia and distinguishes cells as they are 
      turning cancerous. With 127 patents in 13 countries, VisionGate expects 
      to play a leading role in the battle against the world’s number one 
      cancer killer.
    

      As of May 2015, VisionGate’s LuCED is being offered as a Laboratory 
      Developed Test (LDT) exclusively through the VisionGate Biosignature 
      Laboratories, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) 
      licensed laboratory in Phoenix, Ariz. The LuCED test is a diagnostic 
      tool to help inform physician decisions regarding early lung cancer 
      early detection.
    

      “We’re excited to have commercialized LuCED this year,” VisionGate 
      President Scarlett Spring said. “Physicians are asking for a safe, 
      easily implemented, cost-effective diagnostic tool to help manage false 
      positives from LDCTs. We believe that LuCED is a component to the 
      solution.”
    

      VisionGate is headquartered in Phoenix, with a Research & Development 
      office in Seattle, Wash. For more information about VisionGate, visit www.visiongate3d.com.
    

About VisionGate


      VisionGate, Inc. is led by Dr. Alan Nelson, physicist, bioengineer and 
      entrepreneur, who previously developed the world’s first and only 
      automated screening test to detect cervical cancer, marketed today as 
      FocalPoint by Becton Dickinson. The wholly owned VisionGate Biosignature 
      Laboratories (VBL) offers LuCED, a non-invasive diagnostic test for 
      early-stage lung cancer detection with exquisite sensitivity and 
      specificity. This take-home sputum test is processed on the world’s 
      first 3D cell imaging platform, the Cell-CT, named aptly because it is 
      similar in principle to taking a CT scan of individual cells, but using 
      visible light without harmful radiation.
    

Forward-looking statements:


      This press release includes forward-looking statements about the 
      Company’s strategy, future plans and prospects, including statements

      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      those expressed or implied in such statement. Applicable risks and 
      uncertainties include the risks that the preclinical testing of the 
      Company’s product candidates and preliminary or interim data from 
      clinical trials may not be predictive of the results or success of 
      ongoing or later clinical trials, that data may not be available when we 
      expect it to be, that enrollment of clinical trials may take longer than

      the Company’s current views with respect to future events, and the 
      Company does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to

Business Identifier: 3D cell imaging platform for cancer diagnostics 
Public Profile: VisionGate Inc is a BioTech firm addressing development and commercialization of a cancer diagnostics platform based on the company�s patented technology: Optical Projection Tomography (OPT). The platform, Cell-CT, is a non-invasive test for the early detection of lung cancer that generates high-resolution 3D biosignatures from cells in a sputum sample. VisionGate�s first commercial product, LuCED�, focuses on the #1 cancer killer � lung cancer. LuCED is a non-invasive test to aid physicians in the early detection of lung cancer utilizing sputum (phlegm). LuCED creates automated 3D images of cells in sputum, essentially taking a CT scan of individual cells. Once a 3D image is created, a smart computer program (algorithm) determines normal from abnormal cells, allowing for earlier disease detection. Although the CT scan has been around since 1970, this is the first time an individual cell has been able to be viewed in 3D � a capability of LuCED with more than 100 patents surrounding its development.

However, according to statistics from the American Cancer Society, lung cancer survival is better with earlier diagnosis. Our mission at VisionGate is to have a positive impact and save lives using our LuCED&reg lung test to help find lung cancer at an early stage – when treatment options are more effective.VisionGate’s LuCED lung test is being developed for future availability through our CLIA laboratory to aid physicians in early detection of lung cancer. The LuCED lung test requires a sputum sample that can be collected from spontaneous coughs over a three-day period using a take-home kit that the patient receives from your office.Patients then ship the LuCED test kits to the VisionGate Biosignature Laboratories (VBL) where samples are processed on our proprietary Cell-CT™ platform. The Cell-CT platform is the world’s first automated 3D cell imaging platform that computes high-resolution biosignatures from intact cells. The LuCED test classifies the cells as normal or abnormal. Our licensed cytologists then screen the images followed by a review by our pathologist and a sign out of the case as normal or abnormal. Those results are sent to the ordering physician within two to four weeks.VisionGate was founded by Dr. Alan Nelson, a physicist, bioengineer and entrepreneur who previously developed the world’s first automated screening test to detect cervical cancer, marketed today as the FocalPoint system by Becton Dickinson.The LuCED lung test is not yet available to the public, but please enter your name and email in the form to the right and we’ll notify you as soon as it is! Or, please call 602.354.8862 to request a presentation on out LuCED test.Below are some Frequently Asked Questions:Who is at the highest risk for lung cancer?The Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS) recently ruled that it would cover low-dose CT scans for individuals aged 55-77 who smoke or have smoked at least one pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years.What is the LuCED® lung test? What will the results mean?The LuCED® lung test is a non-invasive test to aid physicians in the early detection of lung cancer. The VBL will generate a “normal” or “abnormal” report to you as the physician, which could help determine the next steps in the diagnosis of lung cancer.Does the LuCED lung test subject patients to radiation?No, absolutely no radiation is used in the LuCED test. The sputum sample can be collected at home and shipped to the VBL in Phoenix, Arizona.What is the sputum collection process like for my patients?The LuCED lung test requires a sputum sample that can be collected over three days using VisionGate’s take-home test kit that the patient receives from your office.How long will it take to receive patient test results?Once the patient’s sample arrives at VBL, please allow approximately 2 to 4 weeks for processing.To whom will the results be reported?VisionGate will send test results directly to the ordering physician. It is then the physician’s responsibility to discuss these results with the patient and determine next steps.How do I obtain the test for my patients?Once the test becomes available, you can call 602.354.8862 or email info@visiongate3d.com to order kits.Do third-party payers cover the test?The LuCED lung test is a new innovative test using proprietary technology. While there is a current CPT code for sputum cytology, many insurance companies have not yet established a formal coverage policy for the LuCED lung test. Any costs not covered by insurance will be the responsibility of the patient.How do I request a presentation on the LuCED® test or ask additional questions not currently available on this website?Please contact the VisionGate Biosignature Laboratories, open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 602.354.8862.
