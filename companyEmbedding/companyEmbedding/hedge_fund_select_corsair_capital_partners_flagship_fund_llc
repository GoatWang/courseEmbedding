Our Services : Hedge Fund Marketing : Fund Accounting Administration : Fund Management Solutions








 

























Our value added services  consist of many different pieces. As the hedge fund manager you need to focus  your attention on the buying and selling of securities. Why are hedge fund  managers outsourcing their back-office operations? Simple, focusing on an  in-house back office diverts their attention from their core responsibilities,  namely asset accumulation and building your franchise. Your investors will  appreciate the independent third-party verification of your funds’ operating  results by our CPAs at Strategic Asset Management.  Our individualized services packages tailored  to your fund or situation are crucial to satisfying your customers.   We  greatly reduce expenses and overhead for your fund by eliminating the need for  a large administrative and operational staff.
