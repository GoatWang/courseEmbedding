Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

(CD, **spoken word, music with poems and translations**)  "Acaba de salir el CD "Unbound Project" (Proyecto Desatado), una compilación de música hip hop (rap) y **Spoken Word (poesía/música)**, dedicada a Mumia Abu-Jamal, cuyo "espíritu de resistencia y dedicación a la liberación de todos los oprimidos inspiró esta colección de voces y arte."Queríamos un álbum de hip hop y también **Spoken Word**. Siempre tuve ganas de hacer algo que demostrara la **importancia de Spoken Word como expresión musical**. Las grandes compañías productoras no quieren tocarla porque es experimental, pero para mí un álbum de compromiso social como Unbound Project tiene que incluir Spoken Word. Los jóvenes agarran la onda del rap, pero he notado que muchas veces las personas mayores no se identifican con su lenguaje y modo de ver las cosas. Para mí **la Spoken Word es más universal, porque tanto los jóvenes como los mayores la escuchan y la captan**; por eso quería unas obras de **Spoken Word**"¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨"BizRate.com has the best price comparison shopping information for **Cd Spoken Word Music**. Compare ... 843 matches for **Cd in Spoken Word**.
