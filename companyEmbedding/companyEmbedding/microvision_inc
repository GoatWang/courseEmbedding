MicroVision’s Design Win: The Custom Display Engine for Ragentek



                      July 24th, 2017                    

                      by Dawn Goetter 


When Ragentek, a Chinese-based smartphone manufacturer and solution company came to us about their interest in a display engine to embed in a smartphone they were planning, we were challenged to create a projection display engine with all the features and functions of our PSE-0403-101 with a varied layout to suit Ragentek’s product design.
Because Ragentek’s plan was to launch this product at Mobile World Congress Shanghai at the end of June, our team had to move quickly from a concept to a final product.
Thanks to the number of years we’ve spent exploring designs and display engine use cases, we have built up an array of ideas, and thus were prepared for this smartphone variation. All these ideas let us quickly visualize Ragentek’s needs and present a range of solutions, offering information regarding successful integration measures, and ultimately we were able to provide a solution to fit the needs for the VOGA V smartphone.

MicroVision was able to move to the product design stage quickly, turning around ideas to the Ragentek team in less than one month. In April Ragentek was able to place a $6.7 million order with us for the display engine and complete their integration work with engineering samples.
This new engine – PSE-0403-103 – uses the same MEMS and ASICS components as the standard MicroVision PSE-0403-101 engine and has the same made-for-mobile performance characteristics, including an always-in-focus, high definition image from a small and low power engine.
The ability to meet Ragentek’s specific design requirements combined with performance that is optimized for a mobile product were key factors for MicroVision winning this business.
Our team is pleased to have partnered with Ragentek, as their vision, passion, and product are well in line with what we believe in at MicroVision.
For additional information on our process that led to this design win, please see “From Conception to Production: Embedding Display Engines.”

MicroVision Collaborates with Ragentek on VOGA V Smartphone with Embedded Pico Projector



                      June 28th, 2017                    

                      by Dawn Goetter 



MicroVision supplying the display engines for new innovative smartphone to be available in China
We are pleased to announce that our PicoP® scanning engine for projected display is part of a new VOGA V flagship smartphone just announced at Mobile World Congress Shanghai by Ragentek.
Ragentek, a Chinese-based smartphone manufacturer and solution company with top selling phones in China, India, Brazil and other countries, placed a $6.7 million order with MicroVision in March 2017 for a customized display engine, PSE-0403-103, to be embedded in its VOGA V smartphone. Ragentek plans to begin pre-orders for the phone immediately with delivery starting in July. To support Ragentek’s schedule, we began shipping engines at the end of June and will begin volume shipments in July.
“Ragentek has done an amazing job designing the VOGA V smartphone. It is a sleek, high performance product that addresses the consumer’s desire for slim, compact smartphones while at the same time maximizing functionality for watching video with a large, projected image,” said Alexander Tokman, President and Chief Executive Officer of MicroVision. “As soon as we began talks with the Ragentek team it was clear that they had a vision for the type of product they wanted to bring to market and a plan for getting there. We are extremely pleased they chose to partner with us and embed our PicoP scanning engine in the VOGA V.”
“When we came to MicroVision with our ideas for this product, their ability to work their engine design around our product design was a key factor in getting this product to market quickly. The mobile-first features of PicoP scanning technology such as always-in-focus images, lower power consumption and small module size were essential for us to maintain our phone design and performance standards while still extending the functionality to include high definition projected large screen images,” said Jiaming Le, Chief Executive Officer of Ragentek. “Our target customers want to have it all in a smartphone and today that means a device that is optimized for video viewing. With this engine from MicroVision, we are excited to offer a cutting-edge solution that will give our customers an experience beyond what they might expect from simply increasing the built-in screen a few centimeters.”
For its smartphone design, Ragentek required an electronics board layout that varied from the standard form of our PSE-0403-101 display engine. MicroVision was able to quickly design an engine that met the requirements and could be manufactured by our supply chain partner. This engine, PSE-0403-103, uses the same MEMS and ASICS[1] components as the standard MicroVision PSE-0403-101 engine and has the same performance characteristics, including an always-in-focus, high definition image from a small, low power engine. The flexibility to meet Ragentek’s specific design requirements together with the performance that is optimized for a mobile product were key factors for MicroVision winning this business.

Enhancing Our Digital World
 
Prototype Device
 
Collaboration, communication, and entertainment have all taken on new dimensions in the mobile data era. The explosive growth of mobile devices running on high-speed wireless networks, the widespread availability of WiFi, and the proliferation of mobile apps and content for mobile consumption have created a consumer expectation for any time anywhere access.
The nature of mobility requires these devices to be small – palm of the hand or pocket size. Small screens limit the ability to view and share information on-the-go. MicroVision offers OEMs a way to break through the display bottleneck by embedding our patented laser scanning technology into consumer electronics products.
MicroVision’s patented technology is an ultra-miniature laser projection and depth sensing solution with a wide array of applications.

Projection applications and beyond – enabled by PicoP® scanning technology

Personal Projection
MicroVision’s PicoP® scanning technology enables compact mobile devices like smartphones and tablets to provide shared-viewing experiences that extend beyond the limitations of a built-in screen.   Head-Up Displays
MicroVision’s PicoP® scanning technology coupled with our optical expertise offers automakers and suppliers an advanced, patented solution for sharp, clear images that can be seen in bright daylight like no other display technology.

Imaging and Sensing
MicroVision’s technology goes beyond projection with advanced features that enable interactive touch and three dimensional sensing capabilities. OEMs can develop solutions and products that enable direct interaction with the rich media content consumers are demanding. Eyewear Displays 
Eyewear displays are an emerging application for PicoP® scanning technology to enable immersive, augmented reality experiences. 
PicoP® Scanning Technology Throughout The Day
Colleagues sharing business presentations on-the-fly, or even outside of a traditional office environment. Proud parents showing off their videos or digital pictures to friends and relatives. Teens playing games and watching movies without a television, or viewing a mobile video they created before uploading it to social media.  These are just a few of the real world situations where PicoP® scanning technology allows people to see outside the box. In the future applications enabled by MicroVision’s technology can include head-up displays in vehicles, wearable products like augmented reality glasses and the ability to interact with the data that is being projected.

Vitrectomy Cutters


The Vitrectomy Cutters family (also known as Vitrectomy Probes, Vitreous Cutter or Vitrector) consist of: Vitrectomy Cutters, Irrigation Sleeves and Pressure Line Adapters. The Vitrectomy Cutter attaches to an air/vacuum source for cutting and aspiration to remove intraocular material.  The Irrigation Sleeve is used with the Vitrectomy Cutter to deliver fluids for infusion into the eye.
The Vitrectomy Cutters are used for removing tissue within the eye.  Vitrectomy cutters are pneumatically driven via a tubing line attached to a source host capable of delivering a series of pressures pulses.  The pneumatic pulses actuate a cannula/guillotine style cutter at rates up to 2500 cuts per minute.  The removed tissue is aspirated through the center cannula of the cutter and through a second tubing line connected to the source host capable of generating vacuum.




Trocars


The Trocar device family consists of: a trocar cannula, inserter, closure valves and a universal infusion line. The trocar cannula is a stainless steel tube. The inserter is either dull (2 step system) or piercing (1 step system) and is used to properly insert the trocar cannula into the eye. The closure valves are silicone devices that seal the trocar cannula when instruments are removed. The universal infusion line is a silicone tube with a plastic luer fitting on one end and an infusion cannula on the other end.




Retinal Implants


The Retinal Implant family consists of: solid silicone extruded strips, grooved strips, circling bands or sleeves, solid molded tires, meridionals or wedges or extruded sponge silicone circles, ovals or grooved strips.
Retinal Implants are intended for intrascleral and episcleral buckling in the surgical treatment of retinal detachments, where the retina is reattached to preserve a patient’s vision.  A significant feature of the implants is that they conform to the anatomy of the eye easily. They are intended for long term use.




Iris Retractors


Iris Retractors consist of a bright blue, polypropylene fiber with a unique, easy to adjust silicone stopper.  They are ideal for temporary iris dilatation and can be inserted through a 0.5 mm incision.
Iris retractors are used to manually dilate the iris in small pupils during anterior and posterior segment surgeries.  They can be used for Floppy Iris Syndrome management in Flomax® patients.




Fiber Optics


The fiber optic device family consists of: fiber optic illuminators and fiber optic adapters (for connection to FDA approved Illumination sources).
The aluminum fiber optic connector attaches to the illumination source or to the aluminum adapter that attaches to the illumination source. Fiber optic probes have a polished distal tip designed to reduce shadows and rings and to ease of insertion into the sclerotomy. The Fiber Optic Probes are only sold as sterile single use devices. The Fiber Optic Adapters are sold non-sterile and should be sterilized by end user prior to use.
There are three configurations of Fiber Optic Probes, each having a unique distal treatment influencing the projected light pattern; Focal, Wide Angle (with and without shield).
The Focal Fiber Optic has a relatively flat distal surface providing an angle of light less than 60 degrees.  The Wide Angle Fiber Optic has a parabolic style distal tip creating a wider angle and diffused light.  Due to the parabolic style distal tip used for Wide Angle light, an optional shielded version is available to block the inherent glare.




Laser Probes


The Laser Probes have been designed to provide photocoagulation (cauterization) during vitreoretinal surgery and are adaptable to most laser machines.  The devices involve a fiber optic endoprobe supported by a hand piece.  They are indicated for use at laser operating wavelengths of 500 to 1,100nm. This includes 514nm, 532nm and 810nm.The hand piece is connected through a relatively long flexible lead to a laser energy source.  The laser probes may also be connected to a source of illumination and/or aspiration.




Scleral Plugs


Scleral Plugs are stainless steel plugs. The 19 Ga plugs are color-coded with gold plating. The scleral plugs are placed into a plastic tablet which holds them in place until the point of use.
The Scleral Plugs are intended to be inserted into an unused incision to prevent fluid loss and maintain pressure during ophthalmic surgeries. They may be removed when access through these incisions is necessary.




Backflush Instruments


Backflush Instruments involve an aluminum handle that houses a silicone reservoir and has a luer fitting attached to the distal end. Both passive (hand-operated) and active (connected to aspiration system) instruments are available.  The handle of the active instrument contains a silicone tube with a female luer fitting to attach to an aspiration system.
Backflush instruments are intended to be used for retrograde flushing of incarcerated tissue during aspiration of intraocular fluids during (vitreoretinal) ophthalmic surgeries.




Phaco Instruments


Phaco Instruments are intended to be used with an FDA approved ultrasound/aspiration device during anterior and posterior segment ophthalmic surgeries acting as a conduit to deliver ultrasonic energy for removal of the phakic lens.




Retinal Cannulas


DISPOSABLE CANNULAS are intended to be used to remove fluid from the eye and/or introduce gas/air into the posterior segment of the eye.
INFUSION CANNULAS are intended to be used to infuse fluids (BSS – Balanced Salt Solution) to maintain the integrity of the posterior segment during surgical procedures.
SILICONE OIL CANNULAS are intended to be used as the pathway for injection of silicone oil, via a pressure source, into the posterior segment of the eye at the conclusion of the Vitreoretinal procedure.

MicroVision, Inc.[1] is a US company that develops laser scanning[2] technology for projection, 3D sensing, and image capture. MicroVision's display technology uses a micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) scanning mirror with lasers, optics and electronics to project and/or capture images. The company licenses its products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Sony Corporation [3] and STMicroelectronics[4]
The MEMS scanning micro-mirror is the basis of MicroVision’s technology platform. The MEMS design consists of a silicon device with a millimeter-scale mirror at the center. The mirror is connected to flexures that allow it to swing vertically and horizontally to display (or capture) an image.[5] In projection-mode the MEMS laser beam scanning display method can be compared to raster scanning in a cathode ray tube (CRT) display. Product applications include mobile projection,[6][7] virtual retinal display,[8] head-mounted display,[9] automotive head-up display,[10] and 3D depth sensing (LiDAR). Head-mounted displays are an emerging area of development.

	MicroVision
	Announces 2016 Financial and Operating Results; Annual Revenue Grew Over
	60 Percent







	Company’s
	plans for launching scanning engines on track and expected to contribute
	to significant growth in 2017





	REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 6, 2017--MicroVision, Inc.
	(NASDAQ: MVIS), a leader in innovative ultra-miniature projection
	display and sensing technology, today announced its 2016 operating and
	financial results and an overview of its 2017 business objectives.




	2016 Operating Results




	MicroVision achieved over 60 percent revenue growth with $14.8 million
	for the full year 2016 compared to $9.2 million the prior year. The 2016
	full year revenue was consistent with the company’s guidance. The
	company also improved gross margin to 30 percent in 2016 compared to 22
	percent in 2015.


	In line with its technology advancement plans, the company invested in
	internal development of its PicoP® scanning technology for new “beyond
	projection” applications. MicroVision announced its plans to begin
	selling laser beam scanning (LBS) engines in 2017 based on 2016 research
	and development efforts. These scanning engines are targeted to a wide
	variety of OEM and ODM customers for multiple applications, and they are
	planned to consist of:



	PSE-0403: A small form factor, high definition display engine for
	applications where form factor and flexibility of product design are
	required;


	PSE-0403sti: An interactive display engine that integrates display and
	3D sensing to allow the user to interact with projected images;


	PSE-0400Li: A mid-range light detection and ranging (LIDAR) engine for
	autonomous industrial products and robotics.



	MicroVision began shipping samples of the small form factor display
	engine to potential customers in December 2016 and expects to be ready
	for mass production in the second quarter of 2017. The company also
	plans to begin providing engineering samples of the interactive display
	engine in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2017 MicroVision
	plans to be ready for mass production of the interactive display engine.
	In the second half of 2017 MicroVision plans to begin shipping samples
	of the mid-range LIDAR engine, with mass production readiness for that
	engine targeted for the first half of 2018.




















	The company also contracted with two top technology companies for proof
	of concept demonstrators for augmented reality (AR) and advanced driver
	assistance system (ADAS) 3D sensing. Work on those contracts began in
	2016 and is continuing in 2017.


	In November 2016, MicroVision announced a co-marketing agreement with
	STMicroelectronics (ST) targeting the joint sales and promotion of MEMS
	mirror-based LBS solutions for applications such as pico projection,
	augmented and virtual reality, 3D sensing, and ADAS. MicroVision had
	demonstration systems in ST’s customer suites at CES 2017 in Las Vegas
	in January and on the show floor in ST’s booth at Mobile World Congress
	2017 in Barcelona, February 27-March 2.




	2016 Financial Results




	MicroVision reported the following financial results for the fourth
	quarter and year ended December 31, 2016:



	Annual revenue of $14.8 million in 2016, compared to $9.2 million in
	2015. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $2.9 million,
	compared to $1.8 million for the same quarter in 2015.


	Operating loss was $16.5 million for 2016, compared to $14.6 million
	in 2015, and $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to
	$4.3 million for the same quarter in 2015.


	Net loss for the year of $16.5 million, or $0.32 per share, compared
	to $14.5 million, or $0.31 per share for the prior year and $5.4
	million, or $0.09 per share, compared to $4.3 million, or $0.09 per
	share, for the same quarter in 2015.


	Cash used in operations was $14.8 million in 2016, compared to $5.8
	million for 2015 reflecting the $8 million up-front license fee
	received in early 2015.



	As of December 31, 2016, backlog was $942,000 and cash and cash
	equivalents were $15.1 million.




	2017 Objectives




	MicroVision anticipates another year of significant growth in 2017.
	MicroVision anticipates revenue from its planned LBS engines line of
	business to be in the range of $30 million to $60 million in the 12 to
	18 months following the shipment of the first mass production engines
	which is expected in Q2 2017. Revenue in 2017 from these products is
	expected to be weighted to the second half of the year.


	According to a recent report from Juniper Research

	1

	, smart
	home hardware and service take-up in entertainment, automation,
	healthcare and connected devices is projected to drive revenues from $83
	billion in 2017 to $195 billion by 2021. This growing market for smart
	home devices is an example of a new product category that MicroVision
	believes can benefit from its LBS engine line.


	In January 2017, MicroVision delivered to a top technology company the
	augmented reality proof of concept demonstrator it began in 2016 and
	signed a second phase NRE contract for that program which the company
	expects to complete in 2017. MicroVision also expects to deliver the
	proof of concept demonstrator for ADAS in 2017 that it is developing for
	another major technology company.


	The company also plans to support its existing customers who have
	licensed MicroVision technology and incorporate MicroVision components
	in their display engine products.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
