                        Advantages of Steel





#1 Building For Do It Yourselfers
Steel Buildings have many advantages that make them the most appealing solution when it comes to needing space. All our parts are numbered to correspond with the erection drawings so assembly is very straight forward.
The majority of our customers choose to put their metal building systems together themselves because our pre-cut parts and pre-drilled holes greatly reduce on site construction time, which opens the door to additional savings.

                        FACTORY DIRECT PRICING
                    




Are you Eligible for Direct Pricing on a Steel Building?
In order to qualify to participate in Armstrong's DirectBuy program, you must be able to place a deposit to lock in your steel price and accept delivery of the building in a timely manner, however you may choose to delay the delivery of your steel building system under special circumstances. Ask your project manager for details.
Questions about costs? Price your steel building above or call 800-345-4610 to speak with a steel building expert.
More about Buying Direct


You may be eligible for Direct Pricing if:



                                        You have your financing in place
                                        OR


                                        You know what size building you want
                                        OR


                                        You have land​ or somewhere to store your delivered building components
                                        OR


                                        You're prepared to place a small deposit to secure your steel price and begin working on drawings with your project manager
                                    










                        ELIMINATING THE MIDDLE MAN





Buying Direct through Armstrong Steel
Through the powerful Armstrong Direct Buy program, those eligible are also able to benefit in a couple of different ways. The most popular types of buildings purchased through the Armstrong Direct Buy Program involve folks who are willing to manage some of their own project.
Armstrong's Direct Buy program allows people with financing and land already in place to take advantage of steep direct buy discounts. Armstrong gives clients the opportunity to take advantage of direct pricing associated with additional building components (doors, windows, insulation) as well. All that's required is a small deposit to lock in your steel price.
More About Direct Buy Program


Two Ways to Purchase:




Direct Pricing Purchase
Retail Purchase





Also known as Armstrong's DirectBuy Program, this option is great for business owners and/or builders looking to realize significant savings and take advantage of lower price points.

More on DirectBuy Eligibility


An option for those seeking a more hands on, full service approach. Retail purchasers tend to prefer a local dealer, have the budget and desire for a complete full service approach and don't necessarily mind a higher price point.

INTRODUCTION

    General Steel Holdings Inc. (GSHI) is a US publicly traded company based in China.
 
    Its mission is to acquire and merge small and medium size Chinese steel companies.  These companies may be either privately owned or owned by the government (State Owned Enterprises).

    GSHI believes, with the infusion of Western management systems, advanced technology, and capital resources, the consolidated companies in its portfolio will have a stronger competitive position in the domestic and international steel markets.  The Chinese economy is one of the world's fastest growing with industry and infrastructure development leading the expansion.  At the same time, the domestic steel industry is undergoing a fundamental restructuring.  GSHI aims to take advantage of the conditions within the industry and the surging demand for steel products fueling economic growth.

Highlights in GSHI's growth:
 
    In 2003, GSHI is established as a British Virgin Islands company for the purpose of acquiring and managing steel interests around the world.
 
    In 2004, GSHI acquired 70% ownership of Daqiuzhuang Metal Sheet Co., Ltd. based in Tianjin, China.
 
    Tianjin Daqiuzhuang Metal Sheet Co., Ltd. manufactures high quality hot-rolled carbon and silicon steel sheets primarily for use in tractors, agricultural vehicles and other specialty vehicles.  The company distributes its products through 
    retailers and wholesalers.  The company is the largest producer in China of hot rolled carbon sheets, 0.7-2.0 mm, and maintains a 40% domestic market share of all steel sheets used in the production of light agricultural vehicles.  In 2005, the company expanded to ten production lines producing 400,000 tons of hot-rolled carbon steel sheets annually.  In 2004, revenue was $87 million and total assets exceeded $52 million.  In 2002, the company underwent a management and financial system restructuring.  The company has been audited using US GAAP standards from this point onward.
 
    In 2004, GSHI acquired American Construction Company and its subsidiary Northwest Steel Inc. in Nevada, USA.
 
    In 2004, GSHI shares publicly traded in the US.
 
    In 2004, GSHI signed Memorandum of Intent with Baotou Steel Group to establish a Joint Venture 800,000 ton capacity plate mill.
 
    In 2005, GSHI expanded capacity at Daqiuzhuang Metal Sheet Co. to ten production lines, 400,000 tons.
 
    In 2005, GSHI signed Joint Venture Agreement with Baotou Steel Group to establish 600,000 ton capacity specialty steel production facility.

PRODUCTS

Carbon Steel & Silicon Steel
 
    General Steel Holdings Inc. produces hot rolled carbon and silicon steel sheets.  The sheet sizes are approximately 3,000 mm (width) x 2,000 mm (length) x 0.75 to 2.0 mm (thickness).  Limited size adjustments are possible to meet order requirements.  "Qiu Steelc" is the registered name for company's products.  The company logo has been registered with the China National Trademark Bureau: No. 586433. "Qiu Steelc" is registered under the GB 912-89 national quality standard, and certified under the National Quality Assurance program.  The Company was awarded the "Good Quality Product" award by the Tianjin Products Technical Quality Assurance Bureau in 2001, and the "Famous Trade Mark" award by the Tianjin Commerce Bureau in 2002.
 
    In 2003, the Company invested four million RMB (USD$500,000) to build two new production lines capable of producing silicon steel sheets.  Silicon steel sheets have a higher profit margin than carbon steel sheets.  Each production line can produce 40,000 tons annually.  The Company sells silicon steel sheets to customers in the electrical machine and appliances manufacturing industries.  From 2003 to 2004, overall Company production increased by 13.78%: from 181,481.431 tons in 2003 to 206,487.958 tons in 2004.  Management is strategically transforming Qiu Steelc toward the increased production of higher margin products to diversify its customer base.

STEEL INDUSTRY IN CHINA
 
    World steel demand has increased steadily since 1999, but this increase has been accelerating since 2002 and represents around 50 million tons more per year.  In 2004, world steel consumption increased by 8% compared to 2003, and further increases by 5% in 2005 is expected.  This strong surge in steel consumption is the result of the dramatic acceleration of domestic steel demand in China where steel consumption that had been growing by an average 2.6% a year over the period 1995 to 2000 has increased by some 25% a year since 2001.  Steel consumption in China increased by 13% in 2004 compared to 2003, and is expected to continue to grow at a very rapid pace in 2005 and 2006.  In comparison, steel consumption in the rest of the world declined by 4.2% in 2001 and since then has grown at an annual rate of 2.1%.  In the OECD area, steel consumption declined by 0.5% in 2003 compared to 2002, reflecting an 8.9% decrease in North America that offset a 2.6% increase in Europe and a 4.5% increase in the Asian-Pacific area.
 
    China steel imports in 2003 jumped by 48.0% over the 2002 level and reached an unprecedented 43.0 million tons.  In 2004, world steel trade is expected to increase, by a further 1.2%.  As a result of growing demand, Chinese steel imports should remain at the very high level reached in 2003 and could even increase slightly.
 
    World crude steel production followed the same developments as consumption and reached a new record level of 964 million tons.  In 2004, for the first time in history steel production passed the 1 billion tons level and reached 1,035 million tons, an 8.9% increase over 2003.  This trend will continue in 2005 when production could reach 1,065 million tons.  As with consumption, this is mainly the result of the very rapid expansion of steel production in China.  Steel production in China increased by 93 million tons between 2000 and 2003, at an annual growth rate of 20%.  China steel production exceeded 272 million tons in 2004 and is expected to reach 360 million tons in 2005 when consumption could reach 270 million tons.  Expected steel production and consumption in 2010 are 450 million tons and 340 million tons respectively.  In the rest of the world, crude steel production decreased by 3% in 2001 and since then increased at an annual rate of 3.2%.

NEWS UPDATE
 
    On October 11, 2005, General Steel Holdings Inc. announced that it has retained New York-based KCSA Public Worldwide to provide investor and public relations services for the Company.  "China is the fastest growing steel market in the world, and General Steel is positioned to become one of its leading players through our aggressive growth, acquisition and marketing strategies.  Over the past few years, General Steel has become a unique company with significant opportunities in both the domestic and international steel marketplaces.  As such, instituting a broad communications program will help drive awareness and support our plans to further privatize select steel companies in the North and West regions of China.  Our decision to invest time and resources for a new strategic communications initiative coincides with our recently announced joint venture with Bautou Iron and Steel Company, one of the leading steel producers in China," stated Zuo Sheng Yu, CEO and Chairman of General Steel.
 
    On August 24, 2005, General Steel Holdings Inc. announced that two independent Directors, Mr. Ross Warner and Mr. John Wong, have been appointed to the Board of Directors.  The appointments bring the total number of independent board directors at General Steel to three, in keeping with the Company's goal of qualifying for a listing on a major U.S. exchange.
 
    Mr. Ross Warner is a business professional with 13 years in management, training and consulting experience both in China and the United States.  He has held sales and business infrastructure management positions in Asia working with rapidly growing international companies.
 
    Mr. John Wong is a Managing Partner of Vantage & Associates, a corporate advisory in China.  Prior to this position, he was Director of Deloitte Touche Corporate Finance in Shanghai.

Steel Buildings have many advantages that make them the most appealing solution when it comes to needing space. All our parts are numbered to correspond with the erection drawings so assembly is very straight forward.
The majority of our customers choose to put their metal building systems together themselves because our pre-cut parts and pre-drilled holes greatly reduce on site construction time, which opens the door to additional savings.
