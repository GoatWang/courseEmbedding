	The Michaels Companies, Inc.






	Common stock





	        All of the shares of common stock in this offering are being sold by the selling stockholders named in this prospectus supplement. We will not
	receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock in this offering.




	        Subject
	to the completion of this offering, we have agreed to purchase from the underwriter 2,000,000 shares of our common stock that are subject to this offering at a price per share
	equal to the price per share paid by the underwriter to the selling stockholders in this offering.




	        Our
	common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "MIK". On December 9, 2016, the last sale price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Global
	Select Market was $23.53 per share.




	        The
	underwriter has agreed to purchase shares of our common stock from the selling stockholders at a price of $22.04 per share, which will result in approximately $264.5 million of
	proceeds to the selling stockholders before expenses. The underwriter proposes to offer the shares of common stock from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on The NASDAQ Global Select
	Market, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated
	prices, subject to receipt and acceptance by it and subject to its right to reject any order in whole or in part. We have agreed to reimburse the underwriter for certain expenses in connection with
	this offering. No underwriting compensation is payable with respect to the shares acquired by us. See "Underwriting".




	        Delivery
	of the shares of common stock is expected to be made on or about December 16, 2016.




	        



	Investing in our common stock involves substantial risk. Please read "Risk factors" beginning on page S-5 of this prospectus supplement and
	on page 2 of the accompanying prospectus. You should also consider the risk factors described in the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
	prospectus.





	        



	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these
	securities or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

	This summary highlights information appearing elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and
	the accompanying prospectus. This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in our common stock. Before making an investment
	decision, to fully understand this offering and its consequences to you, you should carefully read the entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including "Risk factors" beginning

	Our Company






	        We believe Michaels is where creativity happens. With 1,368 stores (consisting of 1,221 Michaels stores, 112 Aaron Brothers stores and 35 Pat
	Catan's stores) as of October 29, 2016 and approximately $4.9 billion in sales in fiscal 2015, Michaels is the largest arts and crafts specialty retailer in North America (based on store
	count) providing materials, project ideas and education for creative activities under the retail brands of Michaels, Aaron Brothers and Pat Catan's. We also operate an international wholesale business
	under the Darice brand name and a market-leading vertically-integrated custom framing business. Our mission is to inspire and enable customer creativity, create a fun and rewarding place to work,
	foster meaningful connections with our communities and lead the industry in growth and innovation. With helpful store associates and a broad selection of merchandise combined with compelling in-store
	events and online content, we believe we offer the most complete arts and crafts experience and are the preferred destination in the industry.




	        Our
	stores are at the heart of our customer engagement strategy, showcasing our artistic and creative products while providing an opportunity for our store associates to interact with
	customers and help them develop creative ideas. Our Michaels stores carry a broad and deep assortment of approximately 33,000 stock-keeping units in arts, crafts, papercrafting, floral, framing, home
	décor, seasonal offerings and children's hobbies that enable us to satisfy the diverse needs of our customers. We have also developed a robust online platform which promotes social
	networking, and includes expert tips, project ideas, marketing content and information on upcoming store events. In recent years, we have capitalized on our market-leading scale to create a team and
	infrastructure dedicated to designing, sourcing and delivering high quality, on-trend merchandise, including a growing number of products under our portfolio of private brands.




	        Our
	private branded products, which represented approximately 53% of total net sales in fiscal 2015, are only available at Michaels or certain exclusive partners and allow us to further
	differentiate our merchandise while enhancing product margins. We are also able to use our scale and market leadership to identify and secure exclusive third-party products. We believe our compelling
	store experience and
	broad product offering distinguish us from our competitors and position Michaels as the leading brand that defines arts and crafts.




	        On
	February 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Lamrite West, Inc. and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Lamrite") for $150 million, prior to certain
	purchase price adjustments, utilizing our cash on hand. Lamrite operates an international wholesale business under the Darice brand name and 35 arts and crafts retail stores, located primarily in Ohio
	and the surrounding states, under the Pat Catan's brand name. We expect Lamrite to generate revenues of more than $200 million in fiscal 2016. The acquisition is expected to enhance our private
	brand development capabilities, accelerate our direct sourcing initiatives and strengthen our business-to-business capabilities.







	Share repurchase






	        We intend to purchase from the underwriter 2,000,000 shares of our common stock that are subject to this offering at a price per share equal to
	the price per share paid by the underwriter to the





	S-2











	Table of Contents












	selling
	stockholders in this offering. We refer to this repurchase as the "share repurchase". The share repurchase is part of our existing equity repurchase program. In December 2016, our board of
	directors ("Board") revised the existing share repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of an additional $300.0 million of our common stock, increasing the total amount of availability
	under the share repurchase program to $343.5 million. After giving effect to the share repurchase, we will have remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately $292.9 million
	of our common stock under the repurchase program. The closing of the share repurchase is contingent on the closing of this offering.




	        The
	description and the other information in this prospectus supplement regarding the share repurchase is included in this prospectus supplement solely for informational purposes.
	Nothing in this prospectus supplement should be construed as an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any of our common stock subject to the share repurchase.

	Following the completion of this offering, investment funds affiliated with or advised by Bain Capital Private Equity,
	 LP and The Blackstone Group L.P. (collectively, together with their applicable affiliates, the "Sponsors") will no longer indirectly beneficially own a majority controlling interest in us. As a result, we will no longer be able to avail
	ourselves of the controlled company exemption under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. For more information, see the section in this prospectus supplement titled "Risk factorsWe are subject to certain phase-in provisions of The NASDAQ Stock
	Market and, as a result, we will not immediately be subject to certain corporate governance requirements. For up to the expiration of the phase-in period one year from the completion of this offering, you will not have the same protections as those
	afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements."

	Risk factors





	        



	An investment in our common stock involves various risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of
	the other information contained in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus before investing in our common stock. In addition, you should read and consider the risk factors
	associated with our business included in the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
	fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. See "Where you can find more information" and "Incorporation of certain documents by reference". The risks described below and incorporated herein by
	reference are those which we believe are the material risks that we face. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment
	in our common stock.







	Risks related to this offering








	We are subject to certain phase-in provisions of The NASDAQ Stock Market and, as a result, we will not
	immediately be subject to certain corporate governance requirements. For up to the expiration of the phase-in period one year from the completion of this offering, you will not have the same
	protections as those afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements.






	        After completion of this offering, the Sponsors will no longer indirectly beneficially own a majority controlling interest in us. As a result,
	we will no longer be a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market. However, we intend to rely on a phase-in provision for the requirement
	that we have a Compensation Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, for up to the expiration of the phase-in period one year from the completion of this offering,
	you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market.







	The Sponsors will continue to have significant influence over us after this offering and their interest may
	conflict with yours and those of our Company.






	        Upon completion of this offering, we will no longer be controlled by the Sponsors. However, upon completion of this offering, based on the
	204,712,609 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 8, 2016, and after giving effect to the share repurchase, the Sponsors will beneficially own approximately 45% of our
	outstanding common stock. For so long as the Sponsors continue to hold a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, the Sponsors may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively
	control our decisions.







	Your percentage ownership in the common stock of our company may be diluted by future issuances of capital
	stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.






	        Our Board has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of
	common stock, including shares issuable upon the exercise of options, or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your
	influence over matters on which our stockholders vote, and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that
	preferred stock.







	There may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock after this offering by our current
	stockholders, and these sales could cause the price of our common stock to fall.






	        As of December 8, 2016, there were 204,712,609 shares of our common stock outstanding. Of our issued and outstanding shares, all the
	common stock sold in our initial public offering, our public offerings in January 2015, July 2015, March 2016 and July 2016 and in this offering will be freely




	S-5











	Table of Contents





	transferable,
	except for any shares held by our "affiliates", as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Following completion of this offering, and after giving effect to the
	share repurchase, approximately 45.7% of our outstanding common stock will be held by investment funds affiliated with the Sponsors and our executive officers and directors.




	        Each
	of our directors, executive officers and certain affiliates of the Sponsors have entered into a lock-up agreement with the underwriter which restricts their sales of our common
	stock for a period of 30 days after the date of this prospectus supplement, subject to certain exceptions and automatic extensions in certain circumstances. Such lock-up agreements cover, in
	the aggregate, 93,499,489 shares of our common stock and vested options to purchase an additional 1,631,199 shares of our common stock.




	        Sales
	of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after this offering, or the perception that such sales will occur, could adversely affect the market price of our
	common stock and
	make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future. The shares sold in this offering, as well as our prior public offerings, are eligible for immediate sale in the
	public market without restriction by persons other than our affiliates.




	        Under
	the amended and restated registration rights agreement with the Sponsors and certain other shareholders, beginning 90 days after this offering, or such earlier time as we
	consent, the Sponsors may require us to register their shares for resale under the federal securities laws, subject to reduction upon the request of the underwriter of the offering, if any.
	Registration of those shares would allow the holders to immediately resell their shares in the public market. Any such sales or anticipation thereof could cause the market price of our common stock to
	decline.




	        In
	addition, we have registered shares of common stock that are reserved for issuance under The Michaels Companies, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan.

	Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements





	        This prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein and any related free writing
	prospectus contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance. In many cases, you can identify
	forward-looking statements by terminology such as "aim", "anticipate", "assume", "believe", "can have", "continue", "could", "due", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "goal", "intend", "likely", "may",
	"objective", "outlook", "plan", "potential", "positioned", "predict", "pro forma", "project", "should", "target", "will", "would" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These
	forward-looking statements are made based on our management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and
	business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These uncertainties and other factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from
	those matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.




	        Although
	we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
	Important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements are set forth under "Risk Factors" in our most recent
	Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference in this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date each forward-looking statement is
	made. We undertake no obligation, except as may be required by law, to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
	otherwise.




	        Some
	of the important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or financial condition to differ materially from expectations
	are:






	




	risks related to the effect of economic uncertainty;








	




	our substantial outstanding indebtedness of $2.8 billion could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our
	operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our $2.3 billion variable rate debt and prevent us from
	meeting our obligations under our notes and credit facilities;








	




	restrictions in our debt agreements that limit our flexibility in operating our business, as our senior secured credit facilities and the
	indenture governing our notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions and require that we maintain specified financial ratios upon the occurrence
	of certain events;








	




	changes in customer demand could materially adversely affect our sales, results of operations and cash flow;








	




	our failure to adequately maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, which could
	result in additional data breach, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results;








	




	competition, including Internet-based competition, could negatively impact our business;








	




	our reliance on foreign suppliers increases our risk of obtaining adequate, timely, and cost-effective product supplies;








	




	our ability to open new stores and increase comparable store sales growth, as our growth depends on our strategy of expanding out base of
	retail stores; and, if we are unable to continue this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability and cash flow could be impaired;






	S-7











	Table of Contents







	




	damage to the reputation of the Michaels brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales;








	




	a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our results of operations;








	




	unexpected or unfavorable consumer responses to our promotional and merchandising programs could materially adversely affect our sales, results
	of operations, cash flows and financial condition;








	




	our holding company structure makes us, and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, dependent on the operations of our, and their,
	subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations; and








	




	the Sponsors have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval and they may have interests that differ
	from those of our other stockholders.






	        The
	above is not a complete list of factors or events that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We derive
	many of our forward-looking statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution
	that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual
	results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and
	the "Risk factors" section in this prospectus supplement. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety
	by the cautionary statements contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein, as well as other cautionary
	statements that are made from time to time in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying
	prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein in the context of these risks and uncertainties.




	        Potential
	investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the
	forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference herein and
	therein or any related free writing prospectus, as applicable. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements publicly whether as a result of
	new information, future developments or otherwise.

	dividends will be at the discretion of our Board, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, including under agreements for indebtedness, that restrict or limit our
	ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our Board may deem relevant.
	For additional information concerning restrictions relating to agreements for indebtedness, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in this prospectus

	which such person, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, undertaking, relationship or otherwise has or shares voting power and/or investment power or as to which such person has
	the right to acquire such voting and/or investment power within 60 days. Percentage of beneficial ownership by a person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares
	beneficially owned by such person by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date and the number of unissued shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting and/or
	investment power within 60 days. Unless otherwise indicated, the number of shares shown includes outstanding shares of common stock owned as of December 8, 2016 by the person indicated.

	Material U.S. federal income tax considerations for Non-U.S. Holders of shares of our common stock





	        The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition
	of shares of our common stock acquired pursuant to this offering by Non-U.S. Holders (defined below). This summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations
	relevant to Non-U.S. Holders of shares of our common stock. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed
	thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive
	effect.




	        This
	summary assumes that shares of our common stock are held by a Non-U.S. Holder as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not
	purport to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income and estate taxation that might be relevant to particular Non-U.S. Holders in light of their particular investment circumstances or status, nor
	does it address specific tax
	considerations that may be relevant to particular persons who are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, financial institutions, broker-dealers,
	insurance companies, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements, certain U.S. expatriates or former long term residents of the United States, tax-exempt organizations, pension plans,
	"controlled foreign corporations" and "passive foreign investment companies" (each as defined in the Code), corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, persons in special
	situations, such as those who have elected to mark securities to market or those who hold shares of our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction, synthetic security or other
	integrated investment, persons that have a "functional currency" other than the U.S. dollar, or holders subject to the alternative minimum tax or the 3.8% tax on net investment income). In addition,
	except as explicitly addressed herein with respect to estate tax, this summary does not address estate and gift tax considerations or considerations arising under the tax laws of any state, local or
	non-U.S. jurisdiction.




	        For
	purposes of this summary, a "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, corporation, estate
	or trust other than:






	




	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;








	




	a corporation, or any other organization taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is created or organized in or
	under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;








	




	an estate, the income of which is included in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or








	




	a trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more "United States
	persons" (as defined in the Code) have the authority to control all of the trust's substantial decisions or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to
	be treated as a "United States person".






	        A
	modified definition of Non-U.S. Holder applies for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (as discussed below).




	        If
	an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of persons treated as its partners for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and other entities that are classified as partnerships for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes that hold shares of our common stock and their investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors.

	        There
	can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to
	obtain, a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel with respect to the U.S. federal income or estate tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder of the purchase, ownership or disposition of shares of
	our common stock.




	        THIS
	SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE TAX ADVICE. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
	AND ESTATE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME TAX AND OTHER TAX LAWS.









	Distributions on shares of our common stock





	        As discussed under "Dividend policy" above, we do not currently pay, and do not anticipate paying in the foreseeable future, cash dividends on
	shares of our common stock. In the event that we do make a distribution of cash or property with respect to shares of our common stock, any such distributions generally will constitute dividends for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, and will be subject to withholding as
	described in the next paragraph below. If a distribution exceeds our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will be treated as a tax-free return of the Non-U.S. Holder's investment,
	up to such holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain, subject to the tax treatment
	described below in "Gain on sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock". Any distribution described in this paragraph would also be subject to the
	discussion below in "Additional withholding and information reporting requirements for shares of our common stock held by or through non-U.S. entities".




	        Any
	dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder with respect to shares of our common stock generally will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides
	the applicable withholding agent with an appropriate and validly completed IRS Form W-8 including applicable attachments (which may be required to be updated periodically), prior to the payment
	of dividends, such as:






	




	IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as appropriate (or successor form), certifying, under penalties of perjury, that such Non-U.S. Holder is
	entitled to a reduction in withholding under an applicable income tax treaty; or








	




	IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) certifying, under penalties of perjury, that a dividend paid on shares of our common stock is not
	subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States of the Non-U.S. Holder (in which case such dividend generally will be
	subject to regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates on a net income basis as described below).






	        The
	certification requirement described above also may require a Non-U.S. Holder that provides an IRS form or that claims treaty benefits to provide its U.S. taxpayer identification
	number. Special certification and other requirements apply in the case of certain Non-U.S. Holders that are intermediaries or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.




	        Each
	Non-U.S. Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor about the specific methods for satisfying these requirements. A claim for exemption will not be valid if the person receiving
	the applicable form has actual knowledge or reason to know that the statements on the form are false.




	S-13











	Table of Contents





	        If
	dividends are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States of the Non-U.S. Holder (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are
	attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States), the Non-U.S. Holder, although exempt from the withholding tax described above
	(provided that the certifications described above are satisfied), will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such dividends on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a
	resident of the United States. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to an additional "branch
	profits tax" equal to 30% of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise.




	        If
	a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty, such holder may obtain a refund or credit of any excess
	amount withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.






	Gain on sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock





	        Subject to the discussion below under "Additional withholding and information reporting requirements for shares of our common stock
	held by or through non-U.S. entities", in general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon such holder's sale, exchange or other
	taxable disposition of shares of our common stock unless (i) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
	disposition, and certain other conditions are met, (ii) we are or have been a "United States real property holding corporation", as defined in the Code (a "USRPHC"), at any time within the
	shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition and the Non-U.S. Holder's holding period with respect to the applicable shares of our common stock (the "relevant period"), or
	(iii) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is
	attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States).




	        If
	the first exception applies, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise) on
	the amount by which such Non-U.S. Holder's capital gains allocable to U.S. sources exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources during the taxable year of the disposition.




	        With
	respect to the second exception above, although there can be no assurance, we believe we are not, and we do not currently anticipate becoming, a USRPHC. However, because the
	determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property relative to the fair market value of other business assets, there can be no assurance that we are
	not currently or will not become a USRPHC in the future. Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC only if the fair market value of its "United States real property interests" (as defined in the Code)
	equals or exceeds 50% of
	the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus certain other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. Even if we are or become a USRPHC, a Non-U.S. Holder
	would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock by reason of our status as a USRPHC so long as (i) our common
	stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(3)) during the calendar year in which such sale, exchange or other taxable disposition
	of shares of our common stock occurs and (ii) such Non-U.S. Holder does not own and is not deemed to own (directly, indirectly or constructively) more than 5% of our common stock at any time
	during the relevant period. If we are a USRPHC and the requirements of (i) or (ii) are not met, gain on the disposition of shares of our common stock generally will be taxed in the same
	manner as gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, except that the "branch profits tax" will not apply. Prospective




	S-14











	Table of Contents





	investors
	are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible consequences to them if we are, or were to become, a USRPHC.




	        If
	the third exception applies, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis with respect to such gain in the same manner as if such
	holder were a resident of the United States, unless otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty, and a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes may also be
	subject to a "branch profits tax" on its effectively connected earnings and profits at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise.






	Additional withholding and information reporting requirements for shares of our common stock held by or
	through non-U.S. entities





	        Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and related Treasury regulations and guidance (commonly referred to as "FATCA") generally will
	impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain payments to certain non-U.S. entities (including certain intermediaries), including dividends on and the gross proceeds from a sale, exchange,
	or other disposition of shares of our common stock, unless such persons comply with a complicated U.S. information reporting, disclosure and certification regime. This regime requires, among other
	things, a broad class of persons to enter into agreements with the IRS to obtain, disclose and report information about their investors and account holders. An intergovernmental agreement between the
	United States and an applicable foreign country may, however, modify these requirements and these requirements are different from and in addition to the certification requirements described elsewhere
	in this discussion. The FATCA withholding rules currently apply to dividend payments on our common stock and are scheduled to apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
	shares of our common stock
	occurring after December 31, 2018. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible impact of these rules on their investment in our common stock, and the
	entities through which they hold our common stock, including, without limitation, the process and deadlines for meeting the applicable requirements to prevent the imposition of this 30% withholding
	tax under FATCA.






	Backup withholding and information reporting





	        We must report annually to the IRS and to each Non-U.S. Holder the gross amount of the distributions on shares of our common stock paid to such
	holder and the tax withheld, if any, with respect to such distributions. These information reporting requirements apply even if withholding was not required. A Non-U.S. Holder may have to comply with
	specific certification procedures to establish that the holder is not a "United States person" (as defined in the Code) or otherwise establish an exemption in order to avoid backup withholding at the
	then applicable rate with respect to dividends on our common stock. Dividends paid to Non-U.S. Holders subject to the U.S. federal withholding tax, as described above in "Distributions on
	shares of our common stock", generally will be exempt from U.S. backup withholding.




	        Information
	reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to the payment of the proceeds of a disposition of shares of our common stock by a Non-U.S. Holder effected by or
	through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or non-U.S., unless the holder certifies that it is not a "United States person" (as defined in the Code) and satisfies certain other requirements, or
	otherwise establishes an exemption. For information reporting purposes, dispositions effected through a non-U.S. office of a broker with certain substantial U.S. ownership, operations or connections
	generally will be treated in a manner similar to dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker, and dispositions otherwise effected through a non-U.S. office generally will not be subject to
	information reporting. Generally, backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a Non-U.S. Holder where the transaction is effected through a non-U.S. office of a U.S.
	broker or non-U.S. office of a non-U.S.

	Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them.




	        Copies
	of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is incorporated under the provisions of a specific
	treaty or agreement.




	        Backup
	withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment made to a Non-U.S. Holder can be refunded or credited against such
	Non-U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that an appropriate claim is timely filed with the IRS.






	Federal estate tax





	        Shares of our common stock held (or treated as held) by an individual who is not a U.S. citizen or resident (as specifically determined for U.S.
	federal estate tax purposes) at the time of such individual's death will be included in such individual's gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty
	provides otherwise.

	Underwriting





	        We and the selling stockholders have entered into an underwriting agreement with the underwriter. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
	underwriting agreement, the selling stockholders have agreed to sell to the underwriter, and the underwriter has agreed to purchase, the number of shares of common stock listed in the following table:






























	Name







	 





	Number of

	shares





	 









	Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC




	 




	 




	12,000,000




	 










	        The
	underwriter has agreed to purchase the shares of common stock from the selling stockholders at a price of $22.04 per share, which will result in approximately $264.5 million
	of proceeds to the selling stockholders before expenses. The underwriter may receive from purchasers of the shares brokerage commissions in amounts agreed with such purchasers. The underwriter
	proposes to offer the shares of common stock from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions
	or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices, subject to receipt and acceptance by it and subject to its right
	to reject any order in whole or in part. The underwriter may effect such transactions by selling shares of common stock to or through dealers and such dealers may receive compensation in the form of
	discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriter and/or purchasers of shares of common stock for whom they may act as agents or to whom they may sell as principals. The difference between
	the price at which the underwriter purchases shares of common stock and the price at which the underwriter resells such shares of common stock may be deemed underwriting compensation. Sales of shares
	made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriter. The underwriter is committed to purchase all of the common stock offered by the selling stockholders if it purchases any
	shares. The underwriter has informed us that it does not intend to confirm sales to discretionary accounts that exceed 5% of the total number of shares offered by it.




	        Subject
	to the completion of this offering, we have agreed to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock that are subject to this offering from the underwriter at a price per share
	equal to the price per share paid by the underwriter to the selling stockholders in this offering. No underwriting compensation is payable with respect to the shares acquired by us. The closing of the
	share repurchase is contingent on the closing of this offering.




	        We
	estimate that the total expenses of this offering, including registration, filing and listing fees, printing fees and legal and accounting expenses, will be approximately $310,000.




	        A
	prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web sites maintained by the underwriter, or selling group members, if any,
	participating in the offering. The underwriter may agree to allocate a number of shares to itself and selling group members for sale to its or their online brokerage account holders. Internet
	distributions will be allocated by the underwriter to itself and the selling group members that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.







	Lock-up






	        We have agreed that we will not (i) offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
	purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the SEC a registration statement under
	the Securities Act relating to, any shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of our common stock, or publicly disclose the intention to
	make any offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing (other than filings on




	S-17











	Table of Contents





	Form S-8
	relating to our employee benefit plans), or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers all or a portion of the economic consequences associated with the
	ownership of any shares of common stock or any such other securities (regardless of whether any of these transactions are to be settled by the delivery of shares of common stock or such other
	securities, in cash or otherwise), in each case without the prior written consent of the underwriter, for a period of 30 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions.




	        Our
	directors, executive officers and applicable affiliates of the Sponsors have entered into lock-up agreements with the underwriter prior to the commencement of this offering pursuant
	to which each of these persons or entities, with limited exceptions, for a period of 30 days after the date of this prospectus, may not, without the prior written consent of the underwriter,
	(1) offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant
	to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock
	(including, without limitation, common stock or such other securities which may be deemed to be beneficially owned by such directors, executive officers, managers and members in accordance with the
	rules and regulations of the SEC and securities which may be issued upon exercise of a stock option or warrant) or (2) enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in
	part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the common stock or such other securities, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by
	delivery of common stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, or (3) make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to the registration of any shares of our common stock or
	any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock.




	        We
	and the selling shareholders have agreed to indemnify the underwriter against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.







	Listing






	        Our shares of common stock are listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "MIK".







	Price stabilization and short positions






	        In connection with this offering, the underwriter may engage in stabilizing transactions, which involves making bids for, purchasing and selling
	shares of common stock in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock while this offering is in progress. These stabilizing
	transactions may include making short sales of the common stock, which involves the sale by the underwriter of a greater number of shares of common stock than it is required to purchase in this
	offering, and purchasing shares of common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.




	        These
	activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock, and, as
	a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If the underwriter commences these activities, it may discontinue them at any time.
	The underwriter may carry out these transactions on The NASDAQ Stock Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.




	        Other
	than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the underwriter that would permit a public offering of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus supplement
	in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The shares of common stock offered by this prospectus supplement may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this
	prospectus or any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the offer and sale of any such shares of




	S-18

	supplement does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of
	common stock offered by this prospectus supplement in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.






	Notice to prospective investors in Australia





	        No placement document, prospectus, product disclosure statement or other disclosure document has been lodged with the Australian Securities and
	Investments Commission ("ASIC"), in relation to the offering. This prospectus supplement does not constitute a prospectus, product disclosure statement or other disclosure document under the
	Corporations Act 2001 (the "Corporations Act"), and does not purport to include the information required for a prospectus, product disclosure statement or other disclosure document under the
	Corporations Act.




	        Any
	offer in Australia of the securities may only be made to persons (the "Exempt Investors") who are "sophisticated investors" (within the meaning of section 708(8) of the
	Corporations Act), "professional investors" (within the meaning of section 708(11) of the Corporations Act) or otherwise pursuant to one or more exemptions contained in section 708 of
	the Corporations Act so that it is lawful to offer the securities without disclosure to investors under Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act.




	        The
	securities applied for by Exempt Investors in Australia must not be offered for sale in Australia in the period of 12 months after the date of allotment under the offering,
	except in circumstances where disclosure to investors under Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act would not be required pursuant to an exemption under section 708 of the Corporations Act or
	otherwise or where the offer is pursuant to a disclosure document which complies with Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act. Any person acquiring securities must observe such Australian on-sale
	restrictions.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS






	        



	Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this prospectus to the "Company", "Michaels", "we", "us"
	and "our" refer to The Michaels Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.





	        This prospectus is part of a registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as a "well-known
	seasoned issuer" as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), using a "shelf" registration process. Under this shelf registration process, the
	selling stockholders may from time to time sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings. This prospectus provides you with a general description of our common stock. Each time the selling
	stockholders sell shares of common stock under this shelf registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering, including the
	specific amounts and prices of the shares of common stock offered
	and information about the selling stockholders. A prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. Any statement that we make in this prospectus will be
	modified or superseded by any inconsistent statement made by us in a prospectus supplement. Before making your investment decision, you should read both this prospectus and any prospectus supplement,
	including all documents incorporated herein or therein by reference, together with additional information described under "Where you can find more information".

	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	        This prospectus, the accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein contain
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
	terminology such as "aim", "anticipate", "assume", "believe", "can have", "continue", "could", "due", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "goal", "intend", "likely", "may", "objective", "outlook",
	"plan", "potential", "positioned", "predict", "pro forma", "project", "should", "target", "will", "would" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking
	statements are made based on our management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business
	environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These uncertainties and other factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
	matters expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.




	        Although
	we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
	Important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements are set forth under "Risk Factors" in our most recent
	Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference in this prospectus and in any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the "Risk factors" section in the applicable prospectus
	supplement. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us on the date each forward-looking statement is made. We undertake no obligation, except as may be required by law,
	to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.




	        Some
	of the important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or financial condition to differ materially from expectations
	are:






	




	general economic factors and changes in consumer preference may adversely affect our performance and could materially adversely affect
	our sales, results of operations and cash flow;








	




	our substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react
	to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk, prevent us from meeting our obligations under our notes and credit facilities and limit our flexibility in operating our
	business;








	




	a failure to adequately maintain security and prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, which
	could result in additional Company data breaches, could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results;








	




	competition, including Internet-based competition, could negatively impact our business;








	




	our significant reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly those located in China, increases our risk of obtaining






	adequate,
	timely, and cost-effective product supplies;






	




	even if we are able to substantially continue our strategy of expanding our store base, our success will depend on how well we manage
	our business;








	




	damage to the reputations of the Michaels brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect sales;








	




	our fourth quarter has historically been our highest quarter for sales and profitability, and a weak fourth quarter could have
	material adverse impacts on us;






	3











	Table of Contents







	




	our promotional and merchandising programs are dependent on consumer responses, which could be unfavorable or unexpected, adversely
	impacting our sales;








	




	our holding company structure makes us, and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, dependent on the operations of our, and
	their, subsidiaries to meet our, and their, financial obligations; and








	




	investment funds affiliated with or advised by Bain Capital Partners, LLC and The Blackstone Group L.P. (collectively, together with
	their applicable affiliates, the "Sponsors") have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval and they may have interests that differ from those of our other
	stockholders.






	        The
	above is not a complete list of factors or events that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We derive
	many of our forward-looking statements from our own operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution
	that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual
	results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporated by reference in this prospectus and in any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the "Risk factors" section
	in the applicable prospectus supplement. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
	cautionary statements contained in this prospectus, the accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein, as well as other cautionary statements that
	are made from time to time in our other Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this prospectus, the
	accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference herein and therein in the context of these risks and uncertainties.




	        Potential
	investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the
	forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus, the accompanying prospectus supplement or the documents incorporated by reference herein and
	therein, as applicable. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements publicly whether as a result of new information, future developments or
	otherwise.

	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK






	        As of May 2, 2015, the total amount of our authorized common stock consisted of 350,000,000 shares of common stock, par
	value $0.06775 per share, and we had 207,466,712 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, of which 143,692,460 shares were held by our Sponsors, and no shares of preferred stock
	were issued or outstanding. As of May 2, 2015, we had 108 stockholders of record of common stock and had unvested restricted stock awards and outstanding options to purchase
	8,549,262 shares of common stock.




	        The
	discussion set forth below describes our capital stock, certificate of incorporation and bylaws. We urge you to read the full text of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
	which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.






	Common Stock





	        Except as required by law or matters relating solely to the terms of preferred stock, each outstanding share of common stock will be
	entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of shares of our common stock shall have no cumulative voting rights.




	        Our
	shares of common stock are listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "MIK".






	Preferred stock





	        Our Board of Directors ("Board") may, without further action by our stockholders, from time to time, direct the issuance of shares of
	preferred stock in series and may, at the time of issuance, determine the designations, powers, preferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights as well as the
	qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater
	than the rights of the common stock. Satisfaction of any dividend preferences of outstanding shares of preferred stock would reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends on shares
	of our common stock. Holders of shares of preferred stock may be entitled to receive a preference payment in the event of our liquidation before any payment is made to the holders of shares of our
	common stock. Under specified circumstances, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, the assumption of
	control by a holder of a large block of our securities or the removal of incumbent management. Our Board, without stockholder approval, may issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion
	rights, which could adversely affect the holders of shares of our common stock and the market value of our common stock. Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of preferred stock, the number
	of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting
	power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. There are no shares of preferred stock
	outstanding, and we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock although we may in the future decide to do so.






	Anti-takeover effects of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws





	        Our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that may delay, defer or discourage another party from acquiring
	control of us. We expect that these provisions, which are summarized below, will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage
	persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with the Board, which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in




	6











	Table of Contents





	favor
	of our stockholders; however, these provisions also give the Board the power to discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor.







	Authorized but unissued capital stock






	        The General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized
	shares. However, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, which would apply as long as our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, require stockholder approval of
	certain issuances equal to or exceeding 20% of the then outstanding voting power or then outstanding number of shares of common stock. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate
	purposes, including future public offerings, to raise additional capital or to facilitate acquisitions.




	        One
	of the effects of the existence of authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock may be to enable our Board to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which
	issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of our
	management and possibly deprive the stockholder of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices.







	Board of Directors






	        Our certificate of incorporation provides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board. Our
	certificate of incorporation and our bylaws also provide that a director may be removed without cause as long as investment funds affiliated with our Sponsors hold a majority of our outstanding common
	stock, and when this ceases to be the case, only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our voting stock. Any vacancy on our Board, including a vacancy resulting from an
	enlargement of our Board, may be filled only by vote of a majority of our directors then in office.







	Action by written consent






	        The DGCL provides that, unless otherwise stated in a corporation's certificate of incorporation, the stockholders may act by written
	consent without a meeting. Our certificate of incorporation provides that after the investment funds associated with the Sponsors collectively own less than majority of our outstanding common stock,
	any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders may be effected only at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing
	by our stockholders. As a result, investments funds associated with the Sponsors will be able to act by written consent so long as they collectively own at least a majority of our outstanding common
	stock.







	Special meeting of stockholders and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals






	        Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, except as otherwise required by law and subject to any rights of the holders
	of preferred stock, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by (a) our chairman or any vice chairman of the Board, (b) the Board pursuant to a written resolution adopted
	by a majority of the total number of directors that our Board would have if there were no vacancies or (c) our secretary at the request of 25% of our common stockholders as long as investment
	funds affiliated with the Sponsors hold a majority of our common stock.




	        In
	addition, our bylaws require advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of the stockholders, including the nomination of directors.
	Stockholders at an
	annual meeting may only consider the proposals specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or by a stockholder of record on the record date
	for




	7











	Table of Contents





	the
	meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who has delivered a timely written notice in proper form to our secretary of the stockholder's intention to bring such business before the meeting,
	who attends (or has a qualified representative attend) the stockholder meeting and who has otherwise complied with the provisions of our bylaws and applicable law.




	        These
	provisions could have the effect of delaying any stockholder actions until the next stockholder meeting, even if they are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding
	voting stock.







	Amendment to certificate of incorporation and bylaws






	        The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote on amendments to a
	corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws is required to approve such amendment, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater
	percentage. Our bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed by a majority vote of our Board or, in addition to any other vote otherwise required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
	majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock so long as investment funds affiliated with the Sponsors collectively beneficially own a majority of our outstanding shares of
	common stock, and when this ceases to be the case, a vote of at least 75% of our outstanding common stock will be required. Additionally, so long as the investment funds affiliated with the Sponsors
	collectively beneficially own a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and,
	from and after the date on which the investment funds affiliated with the Sponsors cease collectively to beneficially own a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, the affirmative vote of
	at least 75% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock, in each case entitled to vote on the adoption, alteration, amendment or repeal of our certificate of incorporation, voting
	as a single class, is required to amend or repeal or to adopt any provision inconsistent with the "Board of Directors", "Director Liability", "Action by Written Consent", "Special Meetings of
	Stockholders", "Amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws", "Business Combinations", "Renouncement of Corporate Opportunity" and "Exclusive Jurisdiction of Certain Actions" provisions
	described in our certificate of incorporation. These provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging the removal of any anti-takeover defenses provided for in our certificate of
	incorporation and our bylaws.







	Business combinations






	        We have elected in our certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an antitakeover law. In
	general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation's
	voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the
	person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. However, our certificate of
	incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203, except that they provide that our Sponsors and their respective affiliates will not be deemed to be "interested
	stockholders", regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.






	Renouncement of corporate opportunity





	        Our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to
	participate in, any business opportunity that may from time to time be presented to the Sponsors or any of their respective officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and
	subsidiaries (other than us and our subsidiaries) and that may be a business




	8











	Table of Contents





	opportunity
	for the Sponsors, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. No such person will be
	liable to us for breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person, acting in good faith, pursues or acquires any such business
	opportunity, directs any such business opportunity to another person or fails to present any such business opportunity, or information regarding any such business opportunity, to us unless, in the
	case of any such person who is our director or officer, any such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer. None of
	the Sponsors, any of the investment funds associated with the Sponsors or any of their respective representatives has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar
	business activities or lines of business as us or any of our subsidiaries.






	Exclusive jurisdiction of certain actions





	        Our certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding
	brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or our
	stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or (iv) any action
	asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware. Although we believe this provision
	benefits the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits
	against our directors and officers.






	Limitations on liability and indemnification of officers and directors





	        Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws limit the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and
	provide that we will indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by such law. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our current directors and executive officers and expect to enter
	into a similar agreement with any new directors or executive officers.






	Transfer agent and registrar





	        The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Its address is 250 Royall Street, Canton, MA
	02021. Its telephone number is 1-800-736-3001.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION






	        The selling stockholders may sell securities in any of the ways described below or in any combination
	thereof:






	




	to or through underwriters or dealers;








	




	through one or more agents; or








	




	directly to purchasers or to a single purchaser.






	        The
	distribution of the securities by the selling stockholders may be effected from time to time in one or more transactions, through underwritten public offerings, privately negotiated
	transactions, block trades, purchases by a broker-dealer as principal, ordinary brokerage transactions, sales "at the market" to or through one or more market makers or into an existing trading
	market, exchange or otherwise, direct sales to purchasers, or any combination of the above, in each case:






	




	at a fixed price, or prices, which may be changed from time to time;








	




	at market prices prevailing at the time of sale;








	




	at prices related to such prevailing market prices; or








	




	at negotiated prices.






	        Each
	prospectus supplement will describe the method of distribution of the securities and any applicable restrictions.




	        The
	prospectus supplement will describe the terms of the offering of the securities, including the following:






	




	the name or names of any underwriters, dealers or agents and the amounts of securities underwritten or purchased by each of them;








	




	the public offering price of the securities, the proceeds to the selling stockholders, and any discounts, commissions or concessions
	allowed or reallowed or paid to underwriters, dealers or agents, and other items constituting underwriters', dealers' or agents' compensation;








	




	any delayed delivery arrangements; and








	




	information about the selling stockholders, including the relationship between the selling stockholders and us.






	        Any
	offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers will be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement and may be changed from time to
	time.




	        Only
	the agents or underwriters named in each prospectus supplement are agents or underwriters in connection with the securities being offered thereby.




	        The
	selling stockholders may authorize underwriters, dealers or other persons acting as our agents to solicit offers by certain institutions to purchase securities from the selling
	stockholders pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date stated in each applicable prospectus supplement. Each contract will be for an amount not less than,
	and the aggregate amount of securities sold pursuant to such contracts shall not be less nor more than, the respective amounts stated in each applicable prospectus supplement. Institutions with whom
	the contracts, when authorized, may be made include commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment
	companies, educational and charitable institutions and other institutions, but shall in all cases be subject to our approval. Delayed delivery contracts will be subject only to those conditions set
	forth in each applicable prospectus supplement, and each prospectus supplement will set forth any commissions we pay for solicitation of these contracts.

	Table of Contents





	        Agents,
	underwriters and other third parties described above may be entitled to indemnification by us and the selling stockholders against certain civil liabilities, including
	liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribution from us and the selling stockholders with respect to payments which the agents, underwriters or third parties may be required to make in
	respect thereof. Agents, underwriters and such other third parties may be customers of, engage in transactions with, or perform services for us or the selling stockholders in the ordinary course of
	business. We and the selling stockholders may also use underwriters or such other third parties with whom we or such selling stockholders have a material relationship. We and the selling stockholders
	will describe the nature of any such relationship in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	        Certain
	underwriters may use this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement for offers and sales related to market-making transactions in the securities. These underwriters
	may act as principal or agent in these transactions, and the sales will be made at prices related to prevailing market prices at the time of sale. Any underwriters involved in the sale of the
	securities may qualify as "underwriters" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. In addition, the underwriters' commissions, discounts or concessions may qualify as
	underwriters' compensation under the Securities Act and the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.




	        Our
	common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Underwriters may make a market in our common stock, but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market
	making at any time without notice. We can make no assurance as to the development, maintenance or liquidity of any trading market for the securities.




	        Certain
	persons participating in an offering may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions, short covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with rules and regulations
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which create a short position. Stabilizing transactions permit
	bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Short covering transactions involve purchases of the securities in the open market after the
	distribution is completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a dealer when the securities originally sold by the dealer are purchased
	in a covering transaction to cover short positions. Those activities may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would otherwise be. If commenced, the underwriters may discontinue any
	of the activities at any time.
