The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling security holders.


RV Park Competition

According to Statista the number of RV property establishments increased from
12,804 in 2009 to 13,828 in early 2015.

Our main competition will be from surrounding RV properties in the Southern
California and more specifically the Temecula area. There are approximately 10
RV parks within a 50 mile radius of our property. Our current site is
considerably more expensive than other sites in the area as we only will have 10
RVs at any given time on the property which equates to almost an acre per RV. We
also aim to provide a different RV experience by providing wine tour packages
and discounts to local establishments such as spas and restaurants in the area.
---

Wine Competition

We will operate in a highly fragmented market that is nevertheless dominated in
the United States by a handful of extremely large volume producers. According to
the Temecula Valley Wine Growers Association there are approximately 30 wineries
in the Temecula Valley region and 71 growers. According to data from the U.S.
Tax and Trade Bureau and the Wine Institute, in 2014 more than 10,417 wineries
operated in the United States, with over 4,285 in California.

Fredrikson explained that value-priced wines made up 75% of California table
wine volume in 2014 while premium wines accounted for 25% of wine volume but
almost half (47%) of winery revenues. We believe that on a smaller scale,
locally, we can compete specifically with these large producers and other
wineries for “shelf space” at retailers and at restaurants, especially within
the $15 to $50 per bottle range. Within this range, we believe that the
principal competitive factors are product quality, price, and unique label
recognition, and we believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each
of these factors.

We believe that we will be an extremely small competitor to other vineyards in
the private label market, but we anticipate some of our chief competitors to be
Winery Exchange Inc., the company co-founded by Phil Hurst, Vintage Wine
Estates, Delicato Family Vineyards, Bronco Wines, E.&J. Gallo Winery,
Constellation Brands, Inc. and other California and international wine
producers. While they operate strong businesses run by executives we respect, we
believe the private label market is growing and has room for many players. 

We recognize the tremendous competition that we would face; however, for a small
Vineyard\Winery we believe that our market would be localized and that the
appeal would be for a locally produced privately labeled wine.


Company Description
International Endeavors Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada on
May 7, 2014. We were formed to develop businesses, assets and opportunities,
with a focus on the location and acquisition of income producing properties in
Temecula, California’s wine country for Recreational Vehicle


 (RV) Resort
vacation space rentals, income derived from grape production and resale, wine
production and resale, and wholesale wine distribution and wine tours. The
Company plans to integrate its RV space rentals with vineyards and wine tours
for the goal of offering its clientele a different experience.

In addition the company has initiated the development of an APP for wine tasting
and wine tours in the Southern California area.
