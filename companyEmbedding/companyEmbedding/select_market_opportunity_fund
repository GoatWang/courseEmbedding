 Global Innovations Fund





 
				Income Opportunities Fund	




A Share: IOFAX, C Share: IOFCX, I Share: IOFIX
Objective: To achieve current income and total return by implementing an alpha-driven, “principles-based” investment process focusing on complex and hard to source asset-backed securities.
Primary Goals and Key Reasons to Invest:

Non-Agency RMBS Focus: The Fund focuses on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), although the Fund can invest where management finds value. The management team’s clearly-defined, niche focus is the core of the RMBS strategy’s success.
Strong Track Record*: The Sub-Advisor has managed a substantially similar strategy that has consistently met its objective of current income while outperforming its benchmark.
Private Asset Backed Exposure: Unique sourcing to high coupon, well-capitalized proprietary deal flow may lead to additional alpha.

Alpha: A measure of the difference between a fund’s actual returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by beta.
* See Prospectus for historical performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Minimum Investment: $2,500, Subsequent Investment: $50

				Asset Rotation Fund	




A Share: ROTAX, C Share: ROTCX, I Share: ROTIX
Objective: To achieve long-term capital appreciation with less overall risk than the equity market by implementing a disciplined, rules-based investment process tactically focusing on global asset class ETFs experiencing the greatest strength.
Primary Goals and Key Reasons to Invest:

Tactical and Flexible: The Fund seeks to allocate to the global asset class exchange traded funds (ETFs) experiencing the most strength each month. The goal is to generate superior risk-adjusted returns in any economic environment.
Downside Protection: If the proprietary screens used to rank the strength of each asset class demonstrate weakness in equities, the Fund may invest only in U.S. Treasury Bond ETFs, potentially limiting equity market drawdowns.
Disciplined Strategy: We use a proprietary, rules-based approach to select the global asset class ETFs demonstrating the most strength.

Minimum Investment: $2,500, Subsequent Investment: $50

				Bond Rotation Fund	




A Share: BDRAX, C Share: BDRCX, I Share: BDRIX
Objective: To achieve long-term capital appreciation and total return through various economic and interest rate environments by implementing a disciplined, rules-based process tactically focusing on the global bond asset class ETFs experiencing the most strength.
Primary Goals and Key Reasons to Invest:

Tactical and Flexible: The Fund tactically invests in the global bond asset class exchange traded funds (ETFs) experiencing the most strength each month. The goal is to generate superior risk-adjusted returns in any economic and interest rate environment.
Seeks Downside Protection: If the proprietary screens used to rank the strength of each bond asset class demonstrate weakness, the Fund may invest only in U.S. Treasury Bond ETFs and/or cash, potentially limiting drawdowns.
Disciplined Strategy: We use a proprietary, rules-based approach to select the global bond asset class ETFs demonstrating the most strength.

Minimum Investment: $2,500, Subsequent Investment: $50

				Hedged Market Opportunity Fund	




A Share: HMXAX, C Share: HMXCX, I Share: HMXIX
Objective: To achieve capital appreciation with lower overall volatility than the equity market.
Primary Goals and Key Reasons to Invest:
1. Capital Preservation and Appreciation: The Fund seeks to provide capital preservation and appreciation in all market conditions. Since inception, the Fund has weathered volatile financial markets without large drawdowns.
2. Low Correlation: The Fund seeks returns that are uncorrelated to equity markets through a strategy that profits from options time decay, changes in options volatility, options volatility arbitrage, and price and options volatility mean reversion.
Minimum Investment: $2,500, Subsequent Investment: $100

				Global Innovations Fund	




A Share: GNXAX, C Share: GNXCX, I Share: GNXIX
Objective: To achieve long‐term growth of capital.
Primary Goals and Key Reasons to Invest:





Global Growth Opportunity: We believe growth in robotics for workplace automation has reached a tipping point towards wide-scale adoption Global spending on robotics is rapidly expanding.

Thematic Investment Opportunity: Currently the AlphaCentric Global Innovations Fund (GNXAX) is the only actively managed mutual fund dedicated to automation and robotics. The Fund is diversified by company industry sector country market capitalization and style and acts as a complement to a diversified equity portfolio.

Long-term Growth of Capital: The Fund employs proprietary, bottom up research to identify companies worldwide with innovation technologies such as robotics and automation companies and potential for long‐term out-performance.

Disciplined Strategy: The Fund will concentrate its investments (i.e. invest more than 25% of its assets) in the machinery and electrical equipment industries. The Fund may invest without limit in companies located anywhere in the world and under normal conditions at least 40% of the Fund’s assets will be in securities of issuers domiciled in at least countries outside of the United States.

Market Strength Allocation Opportunity Portfolio, Series 1
Determining which areas of the market provide the best investment opportunities 
  can be a daunting task and sometimes economic climates break with tradition, 
  making investment decisions even more arduous. These situations have historically 
  offered opportunities for patient shareholders to increase their exposure in 
  great companies. 
Our goal with the Market Strength Allocation Opportunity 
  Portfolio is to invest in undervalued companies with strong market positions 
  that have the following qualities:

Strong balance sheets;

Skilled management;

Highly liquid;

Ability to generate earnings growth; and

Record of financial strength and profit growth.


Portfolio Objective
The objective of this unit investment trust is to provide investors the potential 
  for above-average capital appreciation; however, there is no assurance the objective 
  will be met. The portfolio terminates approximately two years from the initial 
  date of deposit.
Portfolio Selection Process
This unit investment trust will invest in a diversified portfolio of common 
  stocks of companies that exhibit financial strength from five distinct segments 
  of the market. The five market segments will be weighted based on the adjacent 
  allocation.


Through our selection process we seek to find the companies that we believe have the best
prospects for above-average capital appreciation.
Identify the universe
  The first step in our selection process is to identify each universe from which 
  we will select the stocks for the five market segments. Each universe contains 
  stocks selected specifically for each component of the allocation.
Screen for financial strength
  The next step in our process is to evaluate companies based on multiple factors.These 
  factors are designed to identify those stocks which exhibit strong fundamental 
  characteristics and to eliminate those that do not meet our investment criteria.
Examine historical financial results
  The next step in our process is to look for those companies that have earned 
  a net cash flow return on investment that is above the average of their peers.Historically, 
  companies that have increased their cash flows at a higher rate have rewarded 
  shareholders with superior total returns.
Select companies with attractive valuations
  The final step in our process is to select companies based on the fundamental 
  analysis of our team of research analysts.The stocks selected for the portfolio 
  are those that meet our investment objective, trade at attractive valuations 
  and, in our opinion, are likely to exceed market expectations of future cash 
  flows.

You should consider the portfolio's investment objective, risks, and 
  charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor 
  or call First Trust Portfolios, L.P. at 1.800.621.1675 to request a prospectus, 
  which contains this and other information about the portfolio. Read it carefully 
  before you invest.
Risk Considerations:
An investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an 
  understanding of the risks involved with owning common stocks, such as an economic 
  recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of 
the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market. 
You should be aware that the portfolio is concentrated in stocks in both the consumer
  products and information technology sectors which involves additional risks, including
  limited diversification. The companies engaged in the consumer products industry are
  subject to global competition, changing government regulations and trade policies,
  currency fluctuations, and the financial and political risks inherent in producing
  products for foreign markets. The companies engaged in the information technology
  sector are subject to fierce competition, high research and development costs, and their
  products and services may be subject to rapid obsolescence. Technology company
  stocks, especially those which are Internet-related, may experience extreme price and
  volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to their operating performance.
An investment in a portfolio containing equity securities of foreign issuers 
  is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, 
  withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control 
  restrictions impacting foreign issuers. Risks associated with investing in foreign 
  securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets 
  are substantially smaller, less liquid, less regulated and more volatile than 
  the U.S. and developed foreign markets. 
An investment in a portfolio containing small-cap and mid-cap companies is subject to additional risks, as the share prices of small-cap companies and
  certain mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies due to several factors, including limited trading volumes, products,
  financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.
Although this portfolio terminates in
  approximately 15 months, the strategy is
  long-term. Investors should consider their
  ability to pursue investing in successive
  portfolios, if available. There may be tax
  consequences unless units are purchased
  in an IRA or other qualified plan.
The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines 
  or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.

The performance quoted represents past performance, does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data current to the most recent month end may be obtained on this website. Investment performance reflects fee waivers in effect. In the absence of fee waivers, total return would be lower. Total return is based on NAV, assuming reinvestment of all distributions. Performance does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.

Salient


Fund Specific Risks

Salient Select Opportunity Fund
RISKS
There are risks involved with investing, including loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results, share prices will fluctuate and you may have a gain or loss when you redeem shares.
Borrowing for investment purposes creates leverage, which can increase the risk and volatility of a fund.
Debt securities are subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, the value of debt securities generally declines. Debt securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates and more volatile than securities with shorter durations.
Derivative instruments involve risks different from those associated with investing directly in securities and may cause, among other things, increased volatility and transaction costs or a fund to lose more than the amount invested.
Diversification does not assure profit or protect against risk.
Foreign securities, especially emerging or frontier markets, will involve additional risks including exchange rate fluctuations, social and political instability, less liquidity, greater volatility and less regulation.
Investing in a non-diversified fund involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio.
Investing in the real estate industry or in real estate-related securities involves the risks associated with direct ownership of real estate which include, among other things, changes in economic conditions (e.g., interest rates), the macro real estate development market, government intervention (e.g., property taxes) or environmental disasters. These risks may also affect the value of equities that service the real estate sector.
Investing in smaller companies generally will present greater investment risks, including greater price volatility, greater sensitivity to changing economic conditions and less liquidity than investing in larger, more mature companies.
30-Day SEC Yield is based on a 30-day period and is computed by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period.
30-Day Unsubsidized SEC Yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the period, excluding expense waivers or reimbursements, by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period.
BofA Merrill Lynch Preferred Index is a capitalization-weighted index of preferred stock issues that is generally representative of the market for preferred securities.
BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II Index tracks the performance of below-investment grade U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds issued in the U.S. domestic market.
Barclays U.S. Treasury Bond Index measures the public obligations of the U.S. Treasury with a remaining maturity of one year or more.
Cash flow is a revenue or expense stream that changes a cash account over a given period.
Citigroup U.S. Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the performance of investment-grade corporate and U.S. government bonds.
MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance in the global developed markets.
Preferred and hybrid securities are securities that have characteristics of both equity and debt securities.
S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 common stocks chosen to reflect the industries in the U.S. economy.
One cannot invest directly in an index.
Salient Select Income Fund seeks high current income and potential for modest long-term growth of capital.
Prior to May 1, 2016, Salient Select Opportunity Fund was named Forward Select Opportunity Fund.
