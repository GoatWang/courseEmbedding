Welcome to PickOne
​PickOne is a creative company owned and operated by myself, James Donald. Based in Edinburgh, I trained at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art in Dundee. The site will be populated with further product news and information about PickOne and its products, so it will be worth while checking in from time to time as the site grows. You will also be able to purchase products, all of which have been designed and made in my Edinburgh based studio.I am primarily a weaver using Scottish based materials including lamb's wool, Shetland wool and other local sourced fibres. Through diversification I am now producing lines of digitally printed scarves, laser cut products and hand etched whisky glasses. This process was assisted by the then-named Scottish Arts Council who awarded me a Creative Development Award which enabled me to take time out from my practice to expand my product ranges. All of this has been well documented in the earlier part of my blog.Thank you for coming to the PickOne website, please feel free to give any feedback you may have using the contact form with comments about product ranges and navigation of the site.

History[edit]
James Donald Armstrong in 1983, founded JDA in Calgary, Alberta as a Canadian IBM mid-range software provider. In 1985 Armstrong sold the Canadian business and, along with Frederick M. Pakis, formed U.S.-based JDA Software, Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio. After signing a contract with a Phoenix-based automotive retailer in 1987, all eight JDA employees relocated to the new headquarters in Arizona. After ten years of operation as a privately held firm, JDA became a public corporation on March 15, 1996, re-purchased the original Canadian "JDA" company, and reestablished presence in Canada. In 1998, JDA completed their first major acquisition, the Arthur Retail division,[4] a vendor of planning and allocation software.
In April 2000 the company announced the acquisition of Intactix division,[5] a provider space management software for retailers, suppliers and manufacturers with more than 3,000 customers.[citation needed] In September 2001, JDA acquired E3 Corporation,[6] adding 500 customers in retail and wholesale-distribution in 20 countries. JDA acquired Manugistics in July 2006,[7] expanding their product line with supply management, demand management and pricing, and transportation and logistics applications.
On November 5, 2009, JDA announced its intent to acquire i2 Technologies, a Dallas-based provider of Supply Chain Solutions.[8] The acquisition was completed in January 2010. In June 2010, Dillard's Department Stores won a $246 million judgment against i2, claiming damages from use of two supply chain management systems. JDA announced efforts to reduce or reverse this judgment, noting Dillard's still uses the software in question and has done so since 2000.[9]
On December 21, 2012[10] New Mountain Capital, a leading Private Equity firm, which already owned RedPrairie, one of the two leading global providers of Warehouse Management Systems software, headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, in the United States, bought and took JDA Software private for $1.9 billion.[11]
On April 2, 2013, JDA announced the release of JDA eight,[12] a cloud-based version of its flagship supply chain software product. JDA claims that its software is the first and only platform that connects critical supply chain functions from forecasting to transportation with built in business analytics.[citation needed]
On October 28, 2014, JDA unveiled a new brand identity and logo for JDA featuring the tagline “Plan to deliver™."[13]
On May 4, 2016, Veras Retail completed the acquisition of three software solutions that had been idled by JDA: JDA Win/DSS, JDA CRM, and JDA Store. The CRM is now called Veras Reach, and the POS Veras Checkout[14]
On August 8, 2016, JDA was reported to be exploring to sell the company to Honeywell International Inc.[15] The sale was challenged on August 16, 2016 by The Blackstone Group, giving an alternative option to JDA by offering a financing plan.[16]
On January 30, 2017, JDA's Bal Dail passes CEO to Girish Rishi.[17]

5.0 out of 5 starsBrother, can you spare a Quatermass?Bycookieman108on April 15, 2004Quatermass and the Pit (1968) is the third in the Quatermass series, beginning with The Quatermass Xperiment (1955), and followed by Quatermass 2 (1957), all written by Nigel Kneale, and is certainly one of the better Hammer Studios releases.  (That's a whole lot of Quatermass...)The film starts out with an interesting find during the renovation of an underground subway station in the English town of Hobb's End.  Seems the workers found some ancient skeletal remains, early primate man it appears, prompting the work to stop, allowing for Dr. Mathew Roney (James Donald), his assistant Barbara Judd (Barbara Shelley, yowsa, yowsa) and a group of anthropologists to catalogue this remarkable discovery.  The situation soon turns from fantastic to frightening, as part of a large, metal object is uncovered, leading some to believe it may be an unexploded German bomb from the last world war.  Professor Bernard Quatermass (Andrew Kier), a physicist and rocket scientist, along with Colonel Breen (Julian Glover, who later appeared in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and the military soon arrive to deal with the situation, but further digging reveals the large object not to be a remnant of a past war.  Turns out, it's not even an object of this Earth, as various attempts to penetrate the hull prove fruitless, as the object is of a material not recognizable to anyone.  Not only that, but a secret compartment reveals child-sized inhabitants of a bug-like nature.  As the scientists, the military, and the government grapple with this incredible find and all its' possible implications, the dissention amongst the parties involved begins, as not only of the origin of the object, and how best to disseminate information to the questioning public.After Barbara, with the flaming red hair and beckoning green eyes (sorry...I got a little carried away) uncovers information about past odd happenings in the Hobb's End area, Professor Quatermass develops some interesting theories about the possibility of alien intervention in human development and reasons why.  This opens a whole new can of worms, and to say Colonel Breen and various high-ranking government officials were less than receptive to these theories is putting it lightly.  There position, akin to an ostrich putting its' head in the sand, is that the object and anything within was all a part of some German propaganda during the past war, designed to sow confusion and fear.  This turns out not to be true, as everyone learns later.  More scientific investigation reveals some truly interesting, and somewhat terrifying details.  In the end, the terror becomes a reality, and the stuff really hits the fan as the object turns out to be much more than anyone had expected or could have conceived.To me, this is an excellent example of a true science fiction film.  The story is thick with rich, creamy flavor as elements are revealed, tying in not only with the present, but also the past.  The conclusion to the story is satisfying, but one is left with any number of questions that may never be answered, due to the plot intricacies developed through the film.  I really liked the portrayal of the powers that be in that they weren't trying to cover up some big secret, but just unwilling to face certain facts for fear that this information would have repercussions beyond the imagination, and most would probably not be able to even begin to wrap their minds around the possibilities presented with the alien object.  There is a real depth to this movie, one that keeps drawing you deeper and deeper, heaping implications on top of implications, giving this viewer the sense that his mind was actually being blown.  The whole affair was very intelligent and well put together, leading up to a very exciting climax.  I would recommend this to any fan of true science fiction, as it exemplifies what can be achieved when all the pieces come together.  This would certainly be the career highlight of capable director Roy Ward Baker, who also directed such films as Scars of Dracula (1970), Asylum (1972), And Now the Screaming Starts (1973), and The Monster Club (1980).  James Donald (Dr. Mathew Roney) also appeared prominently the classic WWII film The Great Escape (1963).  Andrew Kier (Prof. Quatermass) appeared in other Hammer films like Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966), along with costar Barbara Shelley, and also the less than stellar The Viking Queen (1967).The wide screen print on the disc looks very good, with only very minor signs of wear in a couple of places, and special features, which are on the flipside of the disc, include US and UK theatrical trailers, TV spots, a feature length commentary track by director Roy Ward Baker and writer Nigel Kneale, and a World of Hammer episode entitled `Sci-Fi'.  If you're in the mood for an intelligent and highly entertaining science fiction film, you won't be disappointed in Quatermass and the Pit.Cookieman108

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsThe TV version was better, but this is still a really good remake!ByJero Briggson April 21, 2013Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseThe third installment in Hammer Films' Quatermass series, and a remake of Nigel Kneale's television serial originally aired on the BBC. As I stated above, this is a good movie remake, it's just that there is so much going on in the original six-part TV version that it's hard to fit everything into this 98-minute movie, and some of the good stuff in the TV version had to be left out of this theatrical version. Like, for one example, the underlined moral point of the story is lost in this version. I also think the TV version was scarier, more realistic, and was better directed. But this theatrical version is still worth getting mainly because it's still really suspenseful, it's got pretty good special effects in it considering it was made back in 1967; better special effects than in the TV version, and it also gets you through the story a lot quicker. And after all, it does got the same good story that the original had in it and it's written by the same person - the great Nigel Kneale. I also think Andrew Keir makes an excellent Quatermass. I've been a fan of Andrew Keir ever since I seen him in the Doctor Who film "Daleks: Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.". For info on the plot see my review for "Quatermass and the Pit: The Classic 1958-59 BBC Television Version". All in all, this version is still worth seeing.Highly Recommended!0Comment|

McFadinon December 13, 2006Format: VHS Tape|Verified PurchaseWhen I saw this movie, it was called "Five Million Years to Earth" and I was around 6 at a drive in theater in Pasadena, Texas.  My family would typically go to see double features and we kids would watch the kiddy feature early in the evening, and theoreticly, we were supposed to fall asleep before the adult movie came on.  Well this is one that I managed to stay awake and quiet enough to watch when my parents thought I was asleep.  This movie seriously warped my brain and I must have had nightmares for weeks afterwords.  I was way too young to have seen it, probably why I am a Sci-Fi fan to this day.0Comment|

When actors play a monster movie role as though they really believe it, it comes out believable!  I like my monster movies to be played seriously, (unless it's meant to be funny, such as MIB), in that way, you can escape into the movie and enjoy it more.Because it's a DATED movie, if you've never seen it before, watch it at night, alone, maybe with a candle on.  It'll creep you out, especially all the talk about "Hobbs Lane" - and demons.BOO!0Comment|

HoyosVINE VOICEon July 30, 2008Format: DVD|Verified Purchase"Quatermass and the Pit" is the most exciting science fiction/horror hybrid I've seen from Hammer Productions.  The plot is intricate, exciting and thought provoking; it offers extremely unique theories of man's origin on earth.  Professor Quatermass (Andrew Keir of "Dracula:  Prince of Darkness") is investigating what first appears to be an unexploded bomb found during the construction of a subway line.  Upon further examination, he learns that it is an alien spacecraft that is over five million years old.  The identity of its crewmembers is quite disturbing.  Worse of all, the spacecraft appears to have a life of its own.  Pandemonium breaks out in London as the spacecraft takes possession of men's bodies and souls, turning them into killing machines that can't be stopped.  "Quatermass and the Pit" is a must have for everyone who owns a collection of science fiction and/or Hammer Production classics.  I could not afford to purchase the one from Anchor Bay; instead I bought the one released by Optimum Classic, which is NTSC Region 1, from Britain.  The audio and video are great.  It is presented in Widescreen; the menu has a trailer but no scene selection.  I have downloaded photos of the DVD jacket and disc.

I will simply say that this movie seems to be a pivotal piece between the at times Rank B style Scifi movies of the 50's and a next step up to some more thoughtful and well thought out story and special effects.  It left me breathless at moments the first time I saw it.  I tend to be one of those guys who covers my eyes like a big kid at the scary parts.  And this one had me covered several times over.  Anyway, this is worth the money because it is very simply one of the best runs for our money that came along in a long time.  It was released initially titled 3 or 5 million years to Earth which was quite disturbing when I went to look for that title.  Finally I found it by accident in a DVD store with its correct British title.Leave it the Americans to screw up stuff that didn't need fixing.0Comment|

 American Eagle   James Donald, Producer, Responds to Viewer Comments December 27, 2010

James Donald, one of the producers of American Eagle, responds to some of your comments.
Thank you for all of the comments so far -– I’m touched to see how the film has affected people so deeply. We’re happy that our story of the bald eagle was able to reach such a wide audience. Neil dreamt for years about making a bald eagle film, so the broadcast of this show (and your positive comments) mean the world to him.
I’ve enjoyed reading your observations and look forward to corresponding with those who felt moved to write a comment on this website. I wanted to answer some of the posted questions and to add feedback on some of the postings to date:

To answer Ryan’s question, the fish hatchery nest is situated in Decorah, IA. The eagles live on private property though, so no intruding! :-> On a side note, the one-eyed female once caught two trout with one foot. She was a very impressive hunter when she needed to be.
Our production team was very moved by Path’s poem. The section of the film involving the death of the one-eyed female and egg was (by far) one of the toughest scenes I’ve ever been a part of editing. My wife was pregnant at the time Neil Rettig reported the deaths to us, so I felt the loss on a deeper level than expected. I was happy though that the male was able to rebuild his family during the next season and that we were able to capture his story for our film.
On the other American Eagle comments page, there have been some posts questioning the validity of the impact of DDT on bald eagle eggs. This allows us to delve into the issue a bit further. Be assured, our team thoroughly vetted all of our sources. We were keenly aware of the dissenting opinions regarding the effects of DDT on bald eagles, so we were especially careful and thorough with research on this point. We reviewed a variety of reports published by well-respected journals and took into consideration not only the information in the reports, but also the sources they cited. When considering the evidence appearing to indicate that DDT had little effect on bald eagles or their eggs, the quality of the information or sources did not meet with our strict standards; therefore, we feel confident that our film’s comments about DDT are accurate.
I enjoyed looking at Darlene’s photography — especially photos #16 & 19. (The bald Eagle’s wingspan is ridiculously large, and those photos show it off quite well.) Thank you for posting the link to your website. There is nothing like being up close to a bald eagle (although they are not half as scary in person as the harpy eagle — Neil is the caretaker of one on loan from the Peregrine Fund).
To re-chime the bell (as rung by Tom), Neil is the best raptor cinematographer I’ve ever worked with. He spent almost two years filming this program and his meticulous attention to detail and his tireless work ethic comes across in the final product. The quality of the footage is extraordinary, considering too that bald eagles are shy by nature and do not like getting close to video cameras. Canon deserves a special shout-out for loaning us a 40X Zoom lens with a built-in stabilizer every once in a while. If you’re interested in picking one up, here’s the link: http://www.canon.com/bctv/products/hj40×14b.html
For Sharon V (and to the other bird rehabilitators who wrote in), good luck with your continued success in raptor rehabilitation. Neil and I worked on a separate program titled Raptor Force, which aired last year on NATURE. I’d recommend watching it if you get the chance. It’s definitely a different film than American Eagle in a number of ways but also goes into great detail on raptor flight and hunting techniques.
As Deb mentions, there are a ton of webcams that follow nesting pairs of raptors. Bob Anderson maintains a number of such webcams — here is his website: http://raptorresource.org/falcon_cams/index.html

Thank you again for all of your comments. I look forward to checking in every once in a while to answer any questions you may have about our film. And if you feel like a change of pace, please watch our next film on NATURE, Sunday January 25th at 8pm. It’s all about skunks!
Sincerely,
James Donald, Producer

Starbucks Replaces Chief With Chairman

With the stock plummeting and competitors on the attack, Starbucks Coffee said Monday that it was bringing back its top barista to help turn the company around.The chairman, Howard D. Schultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 when it had just four stores and engineered the company’s rise, will immediately assume the additional role of chief executive. He takes over for James L. Donald,  a grocery executive who joined Starbucks in 2002, who will leave the company.Mr. Schultz said he would bring a “laser-like focus” in making sure that the “Starbucks  experience” is significantly different from rivals like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts Coffee, which have lured away customers.While higher commodity costs and a slowing economy have hurt Starbucks in the United States, Mr. Schultz said the bigger problem was the company itself, by expanding too quickly and losing its coffee-shop cache. In short, he said, the company had gone from being “quintessentially entrepreneurial” to becoming “soft.”

“Successful fast-growing businesses can sometimes find that their success had unintended consequences,” Mr. Schultz said in a conference call.  “We lost the focus on what we once had, and that is the customer.” Continue reading the main story

But Mr. Schultz reiterated that there was “no short-term fix, no silver bullet.”The announcement comes as shares of the company have fallen from $36.29 in January 2007 to $18.38 Monday, after more than a decade of nearly continual growth. Shares rose nearly 9 percent in after-hours trading.

Starbucks has more than 15,000 stores in 43 countries and $9.4 billion in annual sales. It still plans to expand to 40,000 stores worldwide, though growth in the United States will be slowed.Mr. Schultz sounded both angry and exasperated Monday. For instance, he complained that the company had only produced variations of new products in recent years, rather than blockbuster new products, a problem he vowed to remedy. But he acknowledged that he played a role in the company’s current woes.The problems that Mr. Schultz laid out reflect many of the concerns that he outlined in a Feb. 14, 2007 memorandum to Mr. Donald that was leaked to the media. Titled “The Commoditization of the Starbucks Experience,” Mr. Schultz said that rapid growth had “led to the watering down of the Starbucks experience.”

For instance, by moving toward flavor-lock bags for coffee, “we achieved fresh roasted coffee but at what cost? The loss of aroma — perhaps the most powerful nonverbal signal we had in our stores; the loss of our people scooping up fresh coffee from the bins and grinding it fresh in front of the customer, and once again stripping the store of tradition and our heritage?”Mr. Schultz said he would slow the growth of Starbucks in the United States and would close some underperforming restaurants, though he declined to provide more specifics.Some of the money slated for expansion in the United States would be shifted overseas, where store openings will be accelerated. Mr. Schultz said the company was not given enough credit by Wall Street for its success overseas, where it operates 5,000 restaurants and where the excitement reminded him of the early days in the United States.He said some of the practices that have succeeded in Britain and Canada would be brought back to the United States, though he would not elaborate.Though he acknowledged increased competition, he emphasized that the problem was with Starbucks itself. Everything else, he said, was “just noise.” “Starbucks is not a broken company,” he  said. “Just as we created this problem, we will fix it.”
