Tinicum Incorporated is a private investment firm with more than 25 years of experience investing in private and public companies.
We are business owners who seek to generate superior returns over the long term without relying on excessive leverage. We combine a long-term perspective and partnership orientation with an ability to understand the intrinsic value of a business and the skill, discipline and patience needed to create equity value for our investors. We pride ourselves on the quality and longevity of our relationships as well as our ability to work with managers to make businesses more valuable. Tinicum is currently investing $1.6 billion of committed capital.
Tinicum acquires companies in private transactions or restructurings and also makes minority investments in public and private companies. We have experience across a wide number of industries but tend to focus on companies or industries that are undergoing change or are out of favor.
A significant portion of the capital we manage is from Tinicum’s general partners, including the professionals who make and manage Tinicum’s investments, creating an uncommonly close alignment of interests between the general partner and limited partners.

Investment Criteria




Selected Target Industries








Investment Strategy
Pursue Proprietary Ideas
We search for investments using proactive processes driven principally by ideas we generate, not what others happen to be selling at the moment. We typically focus on industries that have favorable long-term dynamics or are out of favor. We use our internally-developed investment themes to identify attractive industry segments, investigate potential niches for investment and generate proprietary opportunities.
Focus on Strength of the Business, Not on Quick Returns
We prefer to invest in businesses with good market positions and capable management. We favor operating strategies that preserve what is successful about a business while targeting opportunities for improvement and growth.
We are more concerned with the long-term performance of our businesses than with simply boosting near-term investment returns. We avoid encumbering privately-held portfolio companies with onerous financial obligations (such as management fees or excessive financial leverage) that might compromise the long-term health of the business.
Add Value to Portfolio Companies
Tinicum’s staff has a long history of investing in a wide variety of industries and includes professionals with decades of experience running businesses. Both co-investors and managers of the businesses we invest in find our experience strengthens teams and increases the potential for value creation. We also offer access to our network of relationships, which includes acquisition targets, new customers and suppliers, management personnel, investment banks and lenders.
The strong financial backing we provide facilitates an active and patient pursuit of follow-on investments that should strengthen a portfolio company’s growth prospects or competitive position. We are committed to improving our companies through prudent, consistent investment in people, new products, capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions.
Structure Transactions Flexibly
We structure transactions to accommodate the unique circumstances of private sellers, public companies and management teams.
In private transactions, we have the freedom to allow sellers to divest completely or retain a share of their companies, and we welcome sellers’ continued involvement in the business when appropriate. We have the ability to close transactions expeditiously without financing contingencies, providing a higher degree of certainty of closing.
We have experience building sizable positions in publicly-traded companies in a number of different ways. Our flexible approach to the public markets has included purchasing securities in the open market, structuring convertible preferred securities, underwriting equity and debt rights offerings, providing equity as part of a restructuring, exchanging debt for equity, buying blocks of stock from founding or other large shareholders. We also have experience acquiring divested business units and taking public companies private.
We believe that management should always have the opportunity to earn an equity interest and to co-invest, and we offer these incentives in every situation we control. When appropriate, management and other investment partners also have the option of obtaining liquidity in the event their investment time horizons are shorter than ours.
Move Quickly and Decisively
We assess investment opportunities quickly and with strict confidentiality. We can negotiate terms, complete due diligence and close transactions rapidly, often without third-party financing.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare Tinicum attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.
