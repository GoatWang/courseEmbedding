(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  Through our subsidiaries we design, manufacture and sell clean technology plate heat exchangers ("PHE"), heat pumps ("HPs") and related systems marketed principally in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"). Our subsidiaries' products are used in the industrial, residential and commercial markets to improve energy utilization and efficiencies, and to reduce pollution by reducing the need for coal-fired boilers. Our subsidiaries design, manufacture, sell and service PHEs, PHE Units, which combine PHEs with various pumps, temperature sensors, valves and automated control systems in systems custom designed by our in-house engineers, heat meters and heat pumps for use in commercial and residential buildings. Our subsidiaries also design, manufacture and sell spiral heat exchangers and tube heat exchangers. Our subsidiaries' products and systems are an increasingly important element in providing a clean technology, mission-critical solution to energy consumption and air pollution problems in China and are commonly used in a wide variety of industrial processes where heat transfer is required. Common applications include energy conversion for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, or HVAC, and industrial use in petroleum refining, petrochemicals, metallurgy, food and beverage and chemical processing. Our subsidiaries sell their products under the SmartHeat and Taiyu brand names and also sell PHEs under the Sondex brand name as an authorized dealer of Sondex PHEs in China.  In addition, we offer HPs in China and in Germany under the Gustrower brand name. Our subsidiaries design and build HPs specific to customer specifications and particular operating conditions and are known for their high quality and efficiency. Our subsidiaries produce HPs in a range of sizes that have applications in both the industrial and residential settings. We believe our subsidiaries' HPs reduce the cost of heating and cooling by using recycled air as a heat source thereby reducing heat loss promoting energy saving and efficiency.  We are a U.S. holding company with no material assets other than the ownership interests of our subsidiaries through which we design, manufacture and sell our clean technology PHEs, HPs and related systems. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 4, 2006, under the name Pacific Goldrim Resources, Inc., as an exploration stage corporation with minimal operations to engage in the exploration for silver, lead and zinc. On April 14, 2008, we changed our name to SmartHeat Inc. and entered into a Share Exchange Agreement to acquire Shenyang Taiyu Machinery & Electronic Equipment Co., Ltd., subsequently renamed SmartHeat Taiyu (Shenyang) Energy Technology Co., Ltd., or Taiyu, a privately held Sino-foreign joint venture ("JV") company formed under the laws of the PRC on July 24, 2002, and engaged in the design, manufacture, sale and servicing of plate heat exchange products in China. The Share Exchange Agreement was entered into by SmartHeat, Taiyu and the shareholders of Taiyu. We received PRC government approval on May 28, 2008, of our subscription for 71.6% of the registered capital of Taiyu, and approval on June 3, 2009, of the transfer of the remaining 28.4% ownership of Taiyu from the original JV shareholders who had received shares of our common stock in the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement and subsequent transactions contemplated thereby, and receipt of the above PRC government approvals, Taiyu became our wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or WFOE.  Table of Contents  As an expansion of our business following our acquisition of Taiyu, we acquired and established subsidiaries in China and Germany. On September 25, 2008, we acquired SanDeKe Co., Ltd., or SanDeKe, a Shanghai-based manufacturer of PHEs. On June 16, 2009, we completed an asset purchase transaction with Siping Beifang Heat Exchanger Manufacture Co., Ltd., or Siping Beifang, to set up a new manufacturing facility under our newly incorporated subsidiary, SmartHeat Siping Beifang Energy Technology Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Siping. On August 14, 2009, we formed Beijing SmartHeat Jinhui Energy Technology Co., Ltd., or Jinhui, a JV in Beijing of which we own 52%, to provide consulting services and expand our sales of PHEs into new industries and regions of China. On April 7, 2010, we formed SmartHeat (China) Investment Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Investment, as an investment holding company in Shenyang for our investment in and establishment of new companies and businesses in China. On April 12, 2010, SmartHeat Investment formed SmartHeat Energy (Shenyang) Energy Equipment Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Energy, as its wholly owned subsidiary for the research, development, manufacturing and sales of energy products. On May 6, 2010, we formed SmartHeat (Shanghai) Trading Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Trading, through a nominee, Cleantech Holdings Inc., a British Virgin Islands company, or Cleantech Holdings, to market and expand sales of our branded products in China. Prior to November 9, 2011, we had no direct ownership interest in SmartHeat Trading; instead, we controlled and were entitled to 100% of the profit or loss of SmartHeat Trading under contractual arrangements. Effective as of November 9, 2011, we terminated the nominee-owner relationship and acquired direct control over SmartHeat Trading. On December 2, 2010, we formed Hohhot Ruicheng Technology Co., Ltd., or Ruicheng, a joint venture in Hohhot City, China, for the design and manufacture of heat meters, of which we acquired 51% of the equity on January 7, 2011.  On March 1, 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire 95% of the equity in Shenyang Bingchuan Refrigerating Machine Limited Company, a Shenyang-based state-owned heat pump manufacturer and designer subsequently renamed SmartHeat (Shenyang) Heat Pump Technology Co., Ltd., or SmartHeat Pump. In late 2011, we increased our ownership percentage of SmartHeat Pump to 98.8%. On March 3, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Gustrower Warmepumpen GmbH, subsequently renamed SmartHeat Deutschland GmbH, or SmartHeat Germany, a designer and manufacturer of high efficiency heat pumps in Germany, to extend our clean technology heating solutions into the rapidly growing heat pump markets in Europe and China. We subsequently transferred ownership of SmartHeat Germany to SmartHeat Pump. In April 2012, we invested RMB 4,600,000 ($0.72 million) to establish a new JV named Urumchi XinRui Technology Limited Liability Company ("XinRui"). We own 46% of XinRui. Xinrui primarily conducts research and development, but also produces and sells heat meters and automatic controls or heat supply networks.  The following chart displays our subsidiaries according to which operating segment they operate in:   Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) Heat Pumps (HP) SmartHeat Taiyu (Shenyang) SmartHeat (China) Investment Energy Technology Co., Ltd. Co., Ltd. SanDeKe Co., Ltd.

Co., Ltd. Hohhot Ruicheng Technology Co., Beijing SmartHeat Jinhui Energy Ltd. Technology Co., Ltd.  *Indicates a subsidiary of a subsidiary. All other entities are directly owned by SmartHeat Inc.  Table of Contents  Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance  Our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to the timing of sales of high-value products, the impact of seasonal spending patterns, the timing and size of projects our customers perform, changes in overall spending levels in the industry, changes in PRC government fiscal policies, inflation in China and other unpredictable factors that may affect customer ordering patterns. Our revenues may fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of central heating services in the PRC because the equipment used in residential buildings must be delivered prior to the beginning of the heating season in late fall, which occurs during the third and fourth calendar quarters in China. We also anticipate decreased sales volume in the first calendar quarter compared to other quarters, as our customers generally install and test our products during this period, and are in the process of budgeting their new projects. Additionally, any significant delays in the commercial launch or any lack or delay of commercial acceptance of new products, unfavorable sales trends in existing product lines or impacts from the other factors mentioned above, could adversely affect our revenue growth or cause a decline in quarterly revenue.  In response to inflationary concerns, the PRC government tightened fiscal policies beginning in 2011 that contributed to a slowdown in many sectors of China's economy and restricted bank lending practices. China's economy grew at its slowest pace in three years during 2012 according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. This slow growth continued into the first quarter of 2013. Historically, approximately 40% of our customers, representing the majority of our total sales, consist of state-owned enterprises in China. Many of these customers, the majority of which are real estate developers, encountered difficulties in 2011 and 2012 in obtaining grants from the PRC government and faced an extended bank loan application process, both of which typically are used to finance the purchase of our products. These conditions continued into 2013. Accordingly, the continued deflationary policy of the PRC government affected the number of new sales of our PHEs and PHE Units as certain state-owned enterprises deferred bidding for new projects because of their working capital difficulties or abandoned existing projects. The decline in new projects among state-owned enterprises and increased peer competition contributed to a decline in sales of our PHEs and PHE Units in 2011, 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. We also canceled contracts in 2011 with certain of these state-owned customers that were unable to make payments or that had requested adjustments to their payment terms in response to their financial difficulties. Although these events caused a decrease in our sales in 2011, 2012 and into 2013, a portion of the canceled PHE and PHE Unit orders were reinstated in 2012, and we expect that additional orders and contracts that were canceled or partially delayed will be performed in 2013, reducing the impact of the drop in our sales over the long term. Furthermore, the PRC government remains committed to the construction of affordable housing projects and emission-reduction and energy-saving policies, which we believe will continue to drive demand for our clean technology heat transfer products.  Our revenues also may fluctuate significantly due to material costs, which normally account for approximately 80% of our cost of sales. We experienced and anticipate continued fluctuation in raw material costs as a result of world economic conditions, such as the price of stainless steel used to produce plates, our PHEs and PHE Units. We monitor the commodities markets for pricing trends and changes, but do not engage in hedging to protect against raw material fluctuations. Instead, we attempt to mitigate the short-term risks of price swings by purchasing raw materials in advance based on production needs and projected sales. We typically experience stronger sales during the second half of the year, which is the start of fall and winter in China, during which we historically generate the majority of our revenue. Accordingly, we increased our inventory and advances to suppliers during the first three quarters of 2011 and 2012 in anticipation of our historical high season for production. Management believes our current levels of increased inventory resulting from the unexpected abandonment of projects and cancelation of orders by certain customers in 2011 and 2012 will be consumed throughout 2013 as we fulfill new orders and delayed and reinstated contracts. Although we currently are able to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, it is impossible to predict future availability or cost. Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our cash flows and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which could result in the loss of future sales.  Table of Contents  Our profitability depends upon the margin between the cost to us of goods used in the manufacturing process, such as plates, pumps, water tanks, sensors, control systems and other raw materials, as well as our fabrication costs associated with converting such goods and raw materials compared to the selling price of our products, and the overall supply of raw materials. We intend to base the selling prices of our products upon the associated raw materials costs to us, which typically make up approximately 80% of total cost. We may not be able to pass all increases in raw material costs and ancillary acquisition costs associated with taking possession of raw materials through to our customers, however, and there may be a time lag as we bid on new projects and renegotiate pricing with our existing customers. Furthermore, to ease inflationary pressure on our costs, we implemented new controls over our purchasing process and raw material pricing by adopting a new budgetary control system to monitor our fixed costs and continued improvements to our manufacturing process to decrease labor cost and improve manufacturing efficiency.  The economic conditions our subsidiaries faced in 2011, 2012 and in the first quarter of 2013, made it impossible for our subsidiaries to pay dividends to our U.S. parent company, which is dependent upon such dividends to meet its financial obligations. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company's PRC subsidiaries only out of the subsidiary's retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Further, the Company's PRC subsidiaries are required to take certain reserves as detailed in Note 18 to our financial statements. As a result, we sought alternative sources of capital for our U.S. parent company. On July 27, 2012, we entered into a secured, revolving credit facility with Northtech Holdings Inc., a British Virgin Islands business corporation owned by certain members of our former management, James Wang, Rhett Wang and Wen Sha. Jane Ai, our Corporate Secretary, is also a part owner of Northtech. As amended on December 21, 2012, the Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of up to $2,500,000 with any amounts borrowed maturing on April 30, 2014. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by 55% of the equity interest in each of our wholly, directly-owned subsidiaries and are repayable, at our option, in shares of our common stock. On December 21, 2012, we repaid $1,300,000 of the $1,384,455 outstanding under the Credit Agreement with 1,300,000 restricted shares of our common stock, approximately 22.67% of our total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, as authorized by the Credit Agreement and approved by our shareholders. As of March 31, 2013, the balance owing to Northtech under the Credit Agreement was $387,209.  Significant Accounting Policies  While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.  Basis of Presentation  Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP.  Principle of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SmartHeat's U.S. parent and its subsidiaries, Taiyu, SanDeKe, SmartHeat Siping, Jinhui, SmartHeat Investment, SmartHeat Energy, SmartHeat Trading, Ruicheng, SmartHeat Germany and SmartHeat Pump. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation.  In preparing the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, required by management, include the recoverability of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Table of Contents  Accounts Receivable  We maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Accounts receivable are net of unearned interest. Unearned interest represents imputed interest on accounts receivable with due dates over one year from the invoice date discounted at our borrowing rate for the year. Based on historical collection activity, we had bad debt allowances of $29.3 million and $28.2 million at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, which include tangible assets, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on fair value ("FV"), generally determined using the asset's expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. The following are indicators management considers in determining whether it is necessary to test assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-21:  ? Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group;  We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually using a two-step approach. Based on this valuation approach, we concluded the goodwill balance of $2.1 million for SmartHeat Germany was impaired as of December 31, 2012. Based on our review, we believe that, as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, there were no significant impairments of our other long-lived assets.  Revenue Recognition  Our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 104 (codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605). Sales revenue is recognized when PHEs, heat meters and HPs are delivered, and for PHE Units when customer acceptance occurs, the price is fixed or determinable, no other significant obligations of ours exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue under "Advance from customers."  Our agreements with our customers generally provide that 30% of the purchase price is due upon placement of an order, 30% upon delivery and 30% upon installation and acceptance of the equipment after customer testing. As a common practice in the heating manufacturing business in China, payment of the final 10% of the purchase price is due no later than the termination date of the standard warranty period, which ranges from 3 to 24 months from the acceptance date. Due to the slowdown of the Chinese economy and tightened monetary policy, and in order to attract and retain customers, the Company's subsidiaries have adjusted their contract and payment terms on a case-by-case basis to permit for more flexible and longer payment terms.  Table of Contents  Our standard warranty is provided to all customers and is not considered an additional service; rather, it is an integral part of the product sale. We believe the existence of the standard product warranty in a sales contract does not constitute a deliverable in the arrangement and thus there is no need to apply the EITF 00-21 (codified in FASB ASC Topic 605-25) separation and allocation model for a multiple deliverable arrangement. SFAS 5 (codified in FASB ASC Topic 450) specifically addresses the accounting for standard warranties and neither SAB 104 nor EITF 00-21 supersedes SFAS 5. We believe accounting for our standard warranty pursuant to SFAS 5 does not impact revenue recognition because the cost of honoring the warranty can be reliably estimated.  We charge for after-sales services provided after the expiration of the warranty period, with after-sales services mainly consisting of cleaning PHEs and repairing and exchanging parts. We recognize such revenue when service is provided. The revenue earned from these services was not material during the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.  Foreign Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)  The functional currency of our subsidiaries in China is RMB. The functional currency of SmartHeat Germany, our German subsidiary, is EUR. For financial reporting purposes, RMB and EUR were translated into USD as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders' equity as "Accumulated other comprehensive income." Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income. There was no significant fluctuation in exchange rate for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet date.  We use Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income" (codified in FASB ASC Topic 220). Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes to the statements of stockholders' equity, except those due to investments by shareholders, changes in paid-in capital and distributions to shareholders.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-2, Comprehensive Income (ASC Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, the new ASU requires entities to disclose in a single location (either on the face of the financial statement that reports net income or in the notes) the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). For items reclassified out of AOCI and into net income in their entirety, entities must disclose the effect of the reclassification on each affected net income item. For AOCI reclassification items that are not reclassified in their entirety into net income, entities must provide a cross-reference to other required U.S. GAAP disclosures. There is no change in the requirement to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The ASU does not change the items currently reported in other comprehensive income.  For public entities, the new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, and interim periods within those years (i.e., the first quarter of 2013 for entities with calendar year-ends). The ASU applies prospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations Three months ended March 31, 2013, Compared to the Three months ended March 31, 2012 The following table sets forth the results of our operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales, certain columns may not add due to rounding. 2013 2012 $ % of Sales $ % of Sales Sales $ 6,168,431 $ 6,746,398 Cost of sales 8,945,191 145 % 5,074,937 75 % Gross profit (loss) (2,776,760) (45)% 1,671,461 25 % Operating expenses 10,036,338 163 % 9,546,867 142 % Loss from operations (12,813,098) (208)% (7,875,406) (117)% Non-operating income (expenses), net (77,962) (1)% 861,047 13 % Income tax benefit (22,444) 0.4 % (24,104) 0.4 % Noncontrolling interest (44,742) (1)% (57,790) (1)% Net Loss to SmartHeat Inc. $ (12,823,874) (208)% $ (6,932,465) (103)%  Sales. Net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2013, were $6.17 million, consisting of $2.00 million for PHEs, $3.87 million for PHE Units, $0.15 million for heat meters and $0.15 million for HPs, while net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2012, were $6.75 million, consisting of $3.40 million for PHEs, $2.83 million for PHE Units, $0.03 million for heat meters and $0.49 million for HPs, an overall decrease of $0.58 million or 9%. The 9% decrease in total revenue was due primarily to the decrease in sales volume in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to 2012. Sales volume of PHEs, PHE Units, heat meters and HPs decreased 46%, 4%, 85% and 36%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease in sales volume in the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to 2012 resulted from the continued effects of a tightened fiscal policy in China, which has contributed to a slowdown in . . .

A "Green" Technology Company: China is a country that derives the majority of its heat energy through burning coal. Massive air pollution is created due to inefficient coal burning. As the developer of 6 key patents across our product lines, SmartHeat's plate heat exchanger (PHE) technology and products help reduce fossil fuel related costs and pollution by capturing and recycling waste heat thereby producing less CO2 emissions. More efficient energy use also leads to significant savings for end users as shown in the following illustration:

Rapid Earnings Growth: SmartHeat reported US$0.18 per share in net income, an increase of 1700% in the quarter ended September 30, 2008. For the year 2008, we reported net income of $0.29 per share, an increase of 203% from 2007. This dramatic increase in earnings is a direct result of strong customer demand for our energy saving equipment in a favorable market environment. We anticipate continued rapid expansion in China's heat and energy savings industry, a market which is currently estimated at approximately $2.4 billion dollars annually with double digit annual growth. 
Direct Beneficiary of China's National Economic Stimulus Plan: Industry growth is fostered by numerous government initiatives. The Chinese government has begun to mandate efficient energy use to ensure sustainable development during the country's rapid economic growth. SmartHeat recently announced an initial order from a Chinese municipality which had received funding from China's central government under China's national economic stimulus plan.
Strong Customer Base: SmartHeat provides energy efficient heat solutions to industrial, residential, and commercial markets. Notable customers include Motorola, Dalkia, Veolia, BeijingInternationalAirport, Sinopec, and ACIC Air and many others. 
Founders/Managers Have Vested Interest with Our Shareholders: SmartHeat is run by company founders / managers. Our senior executives are industry experts who are also our controlling shareholders. Our in-depth understanding of the markets which we serve ensures long term success for our company and for our shareholders.

"We are a U. S. public company operating under U. S. corporate governance"
Smartheat is a Nevada registered company involved primarily in the research, production, manufacture, and sale of plate heat exchange products [PHE]. Our PHE products are utilized in industrial, commercial and residential applications.

                          PHEs are highly versatile products. They are commonly used in power generation and chemicals processing industries as well as shipping, automotive, petroleum refinement and derivative products, electric power and HVAC generation & distribution, edible oils, metallurgy, electronics, and food & beverages. 

"We research, manufacture and sell top-quality heat exchange products to help meet the increasing energy needs of tomorrow"
Our Company maintains the highest standards and to these ends is both government certified and licensed. 
                          

                          Smartheat is the largest OEM of SONDEX in China.  We use SONDEX high quality stainless steel plates to design, manufacture and sell PHEs in all of Northern China.

What are heat 


 exchangers

 or PHE products?
Heat exchangers are devices in which heating or cooling is transferred via the plates from one substance to another. The process includes both convection and conduction resulting in significantly improved energy capture as well as greater control over processing temperatures and pressure.  Click here to see how our PHEs work 
Why use a PHE? 
With no currently viable economic alternative to exhaustible fossil fuels, public and private entities must utilize such resources in a more efficient manner. By improving energy capture, SmartHeat's PHE products help various industries and individuals reduce energy costs and their impact on the environment. 
"Our future portends powerful growth"
As China experiences record economic growth, increasing energy costs and an urgent need to address environmental concerns, the market for PHEs and related products in China is entering a new era of rapid expansion.  Our sales and net income grew by 61.8% and 150.7%, respectively, in 2007.  With the market for PHE products in China expected to grow at 30%1  annually through 2010,  we expect to maintain or exceed our current growth rates through that time. 
With top-flight engineering and technical professionals, an active and growing customer base, and efficient and timely service supported by experienced and knowledgeable management, SmartHeat is poised to play a significant role in helping China to manage pollution and improve its energy efficiency.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
