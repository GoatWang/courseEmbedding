History[edit]
In 1989, CamelBak founder Michael Eidson was competing in the "Hotter 'n Hell 100" bike race in Wichita Falls, Texas.[1] Eidson, who was an EMT by trade, filled an IV bag with water and stuck it in a tube sock. He then pinned the tube sock to the back of his jersey, pulled the tube over his shoulder, and secured it with a clothes pin. Within a few months, Eidson began selling the first CamelBak product, the ThermalBak, which quickly became popular among cyclists.[2]




Military hydration pack


U.S. troops took CamelBak products into battle in the first Gulf War and they quickly became a popular product at military exchanges. CamelBak's defense sales grew further during the second Gulf War and the War in Afghanistan. U.S. and foreign government contracts made up about 40% of CamelBak's business as of 2012.[3]
CamelBak was sold to San Francisco toymaker Kransco in 1996 for $5 million. Bear Stearns Merchant Banking bought it for $210 million in 2004.[3]
In 2006, CamelBak expanded into the water bottle business. The company differentiated its bottles by making them taste-free, using bite valves designed to stop leaks while allowing easy sipping. Eliminating the use of BPA In 2011, water bottles accounted for about 31% of CamelBak's sales.[3]
Compass Diversified Holdings, a private equity firm, purchased the company in August 2010 for $258 million.[3]
In February 2015, CamelBak filed a patent-infringement suit against Osprey to protect its hands-free reservoir hydration systems. The suit was settled in July 2015 on confidential terms.[4]
CamelBak was purchased by Vista Outdoor in July 2015 for $412.5 million. Vista Outdoor will integrate CamelBak's 300 employees into its outdoor products division.[5]
Products[edit]
Hydration packs[edit]




An example of a civilian CamelBak pack. The blue tube coming off the top enables the wearer to drink from the internal water bladder without removing the pack.


CamelBak's hydration packs come in capacities of 1.5 to 3.0 litres (50–100 US fluid oz) in a backpack style primarily for biking, hiking and other outdoor activities, with smaller belt-type 0.83 to 1.3 litre (28–45 US fluid oz) packs designed for runners and walkers.
CamelBak also makes bottles, general purpose backpacks, and some specialized military and law-enforcement gear, ranging from simple back-worn water reservoirs with little to no cargo capacity, to large rucksacks with various accessories, even PALS webbing to accommodate MOLLE gear.[6]
One of CamelBak's military lines features reservoirs that resist chemical and biological weapons; they are designed to be used with gas masks.[3] The United States Army approved the use of CamelBak CBR X hydration packs in November 2015. The Army's office of the Product Manager-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment and the Army's Test and Evaluation Command approved the three-liter CBR X after exposing it to nerve agents for six hours after thirty days of use in the field and then verifying that the water inside remained uncontaminated and performing numerous other tests since 2006.[7]
Water bottles[edit]
CamelBak manufactures a line of water bottles, including water bottles with a dip straw and a collapsible bite valve and another line for cyclists with a centered valve, no dip straw, and a squeezable body. Reusable water bottles increased in popularity after bottled water was denounced by environmentalists.[8]
Since 2008, these CamelBak products have been manufactured without BPA, a potentially toxic chemical commonly used to harden polycarbonate plastic, or phthalates. CamelBak now uses copolyester from Eastman Tritan. CamelBak claims to be the first company in its industry to stop using BPA in all its products.[8]
Water purification[edit]
In January 2012, CamelBak started selling its All Clear portable water purification system. All Clear uses ultraviolet light to make untreated water potable in about one minute.[3]
In 2014, CamelBak released a filtered water pitcher called the Relay. CamelBak claims that the Relay filters water ten times faster than competing products; this is fast enough to keep up with the flow rate of a kitchen faucet. The Relay uses large pleated filters that last about four months.[6]
In May 2015, Nephros, a medical device company that specializes in liquid purification, announced that it had licensed its HydraGuard line of military-grade water filters to CamelBak. The terms of the deal give CamelBak the exclusive right to sell HydraGuard products.[9]
Operations[edit]
CamelBak moved to Petaluma, California in 1999. As of 2017, about 150 people work at CamelBak's headquarters there. CamelBak converted its rented office space into a LEED-certified facility. All CamelBak products are designed and tested in Petaluma. The company manufactures its products at other locations in the United States, Mexico, and Asia.[3]
Leadership[edit]
Layne Rigney[edit]
Layne Rigney took over as the firm's head on February 1, 2016. Rigney served as CamelBak's senior vice president of global sales since 2012. He has 25 years of relevant experience with companies such as PowerBar/Nestle USA, RockShox, and REI.[10]
Sally McCoy[edit]
Sally McCoy served as CamelBak's chief executive officer until 2016 after leading the firm for nine years. McCoy is also a co-founder and former chair of the Outdoor industry Association, formerly known as ORCA. She was a founding partner at Silver Steep Partners, a financial consultancy that caters exclusively to companies in the outdoor and "active lifestyle" markets. McCoy has served as president of both Sierra Designs and Ultimate Direction. She served as vice president at The North Face. She received the Outdoor Industry Leadership Award and was named one of the "Top Innovators of the Last 25 Years" by Outside Magazine. She won the 2011 Outdoor Industry Pioneering Woman Award from the Outdoor Industries Women's Coalition. McCoy earned a bachelor of arts degree in history from Dartmouth College.[11]

History[edit]
In 1989, CamelBak founder Michael Eidson was competing in the "Hotter 'n Hell 100" bike race in Wichita Falls, Texas.[1] Eidson, who was an EMT by trade, filled an IV bag with water and stuck it in a tube sock. He then pinned the tube sock to the back of his jersey, pulled the tube over his shoulder, and secured it with a clothes pin. Within a few months, Eidson began selling the first CamelBak product, the ThermalBak, which quickly became popular among cyclists.[2]




Military hydration pack


U.S. troops took CamelBak products into battle in the first Gulf War and they quickly became a popular product at military exchanges. CamelBak's defense sales grew further during the second Gulf War and the War in Afghanistan. U.S. and foreign government contracts made up about 40% of CamelBak's business as of 2012.[3]
CamelBak was sold to San Francisco toymaker Kransco in 1996 for $5 million. Bear Stearns Merchant Banking bought it for $210 million in 2004.[3]
In 2006, CamelBak expanded into the water bottle business. The company differentiated its bottles by making them taste-free, using bite valves designed to stop leaks while allowing easy sipping. Eliminating the use of BPA In 2011, water bottles accounted for about 31% of CamelBak's sales.[3]
Compass Diversified Holdings, a private equity firm, purchased the company in August 2010 for $258 million.[3]
In February 2015, CamelBak filed a patent-infringement suit against Osprey to protect its hands-free reservoir hydration systems. The suit was settled in July 2015 on confidential terms.[4]
CamelBak was purchased by Vista Outdoor in July 2015 for $412.5 million. Vista Outdoor will integrate CamelBak's 300 employees into its outdoor products division.[5]
Products[edit]
Hydration packs[edit]




An example of a civilian CamelBak pack. The blue tube coming off the top enables the wearer to drink from the internal water bladder without removing the pack.


CamelBak's hydration packs come in capacities of 1.5 to 3.0 litres (50–100 US fluid oz) in a backpack style primarily for biking, hiking and other outdoor activities, with smaller belt-type 0.83 to 1.3 litre (28–45 US fluid oz) packs designed for runners and walkers.
CamelBak also makes bottles, general purpose backpacks, and some specialized military and law-enforcement gear, ranging from simple back-worn water reservoirs with little to no cargo capacity, to large rucksacks with various accessories, even PALS webbing to accommodate MOLLE gear.[6]
One of CamelBak's military lines features reservoirs that resist chemical and biological weapons; they are designed to be used with gas masks.[3] The United States Army approved the use of CamelBak CBR X hydration packs in November 2015. The Army's office of the Product Manager-Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment and the Army's Test and Evaluation Command approved the three-liter CBR X after exposing it to nerve agents for six hours after thirty days of use in the field and then verifying that the water inside remained uncontaminated and performing numerous other tests since 2006.[7]
Water bottles[edit]
CamelBak manufactures a line of water bottles, including water bottles with a dip straw and a collapsible bite valve and another line for cyclists with a centered valve, no dip straw, and a squeezable body. Reusable water bottles increased in popularity after bottled water was denounced by environmentalists.[8]
Since 2008, these CamelBak products have been manufactured without BPA, a potentially toxic chemical commonly used to harden polycarbonate plastic, or phthalates. CamelBak now uses copolyester from Eastman Tritan. CamelBak claims to be the first company in its industry to stop using BPA in all its products.[8]
Water purification[edit]
In January 2012, CamelBak started selling its All Clear portable water purification system. All Clear uses ultraviolet light to make untreated water potable in about one minute.[3]
In 2014, CamelBak released a filtered water pitcher called the Relay. CamelBak claims that the Relay filters water ten times faster than competing products; this is fast enough to keep up with the flow rate of a kitchen faucet. The Relay uses large pleated filters that last about four months.[6]
In May 2015, Nephros, a medical device company that specializes in liquid purification, announced that it had licensed its HydraGuard line of military-grade water filters to CamelBak. The terms of the deal give CamelBak the exclusive right to sell HydraGuard products.[9]
Operations[edit]
CamelBak moved to Petaluma, California in 1999. As of 2017, about 150 people work at CamelBak's headquarters there. CamelBak converted its rented office space into a LEED-certified facility. All CamelBak products are designed and tested in Petaluma. The company manufactures its products at other locations in the United States, Mexico, and Asia.[3]
Leadership[edit]
Layne Rigney[edit]
Layne Rigney took over as the firm's head on February 1, 2016. Rigney served as CamelBak's senior vice president of global sales since 2012. He has 25 years of relevant experience with companies such as PowerBar/Nestle USA, RockShox, and REI.[10]
Sally McCoy[edit]
Sally McCoy served as CamelBak's chief executive officer until 2016 after leading the firm for nine years. McCoy is also a co-founder and former chair of the Outdoor industry Association, formerly known as ORCA. She was a founding partner at Silver Steep Partners, a financial consultancy that caters exclusively to companies in the outdoor and "active lifestyle" markets. McCoy has served as president of both Sierra Designs and Ultimate Direction. She served as vice president at The North Face. She received the Outdoor Industry Leadership Award and was named one of the "Top Innovators of the Last 25 Years" by Outside Magazine. She won the 2011 Outdoor Industry Pioneering Woman Award from the Outdoor Industries Women's Coalition. McCoy earned a bachelor of arts degree in history from Dartmouth College.[11]

The Taylor Made Group and all of our affiliated business units proudly celebrated the 100th anniversary of Taylor Made in 2008.


Nelson A. Taylor started Taylor Made in 1908 as a canvas business. From its very inception, it was his vision for the company to take an aggressive stance on product development — unveiling many uniquely creative and original canvas offerings. Then in 1946, upon the founder’s passing, his son Willard Taylor was named company president. It was from this point forward, and under Willard’s leadership, that Taylor Made began to grow and expand rapidly. Willard Taylor brought with him a decisive commitment to the burgeoning recreational boating market, along with a quest to push design and technology ever forward with new applications, processes and products.
From the introduction of the first wraparound acrylic windshield for motorboats in 1951, to the first curved, tempered safety glass windshield, to manufacturing the first vinyl fenders ‘guaranteed for the life of your boat,’ to countless advancements in glass bending, stainless steel welding, and other technologies that have defined the modern era of boat windshield design, Taylor Made has been a leader in addressing the unique challenges of the marine market.
To this day, Taylor Made Systems – together with recent acquisitions, Trend Marine Products Ltd. and WaterBonnet Mfg., Inc. – is the world’s largest manufacturer of marine glazing systems and sets the pace for advancements in the styling and design of boat windshields, windows, doors, hatches, power roof systems, portlights and more. Taylor Made Products is the world’s leading supplier of boat fenders and buoys as well as one of the largest and most innovative suppliers of marine aftermarket products, including boat covers, bimini tops, dock products, flags, hardware and more. TaylorBrite® utilizes proprietary technologies, such as LED and cold-cathode lighting, to provide advanced lighting systems for marine and other markets. Its products are setting new records for service life and reliability.
Additionally, Taylor Made has successfully led the way into other areas of the marine marketplace. In 1977, Marine Air Systems was established to manufacture high-performance comfort-control systems, refrigeration systems, and more – eventually, through the acquisition of Marine Development Corp. (Cruisair) and Condaria in Italy, growing into Taylor Made Environmental. In 1984, SeaLand Technology was launched to address the needs of marine sanitation — using innovative Vacuflush® technology. Both of these companies flourished as Taylor Made owned entities for many years, before being divested so that the Group could focus on its core competencies and technologies.
These versatile capabilities enable Taylor Made to compete in a number of other markets. Taylor Made Glass Systems is a leader in the design and manufacture of curved tempered safety glass for applications in architectural, agricultural, industrial and other business sectors. And, Taylor Made Custom Products continues to thrive as a leader in the design and fabrication of custom commercial, residential and backlit fabric awnings, snowmobile covers, recreational bags & more.
The business directives initiated a century ago by Nelson A. Taylor are now carried on by the current generation of Taylors – Jim Taylor, Board of Directors and John Taylor, Secretary – as well as Taylor Made Group Executive Chairman, Dennis Flint and many other long-time, committed executives and associates. “Solidly grounded in our rich legacy and with our ideals firmly in place, we look forward to an exciting future as we continue to diversify and adapt while retaining our dedication to the marine industry,” said Flint.
