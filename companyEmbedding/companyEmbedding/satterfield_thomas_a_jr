"With more than 20 years experience in HR, I have extensive experience in building and transforming human resource functions at both division and corporate levels. In my role as the lead human resource officer of an S&P 500 corporation, I was called upon by senior management to help recruit and evaluate personnel, including candidates for chief technology, finance and legal officer positions, and numerous division leaders.
