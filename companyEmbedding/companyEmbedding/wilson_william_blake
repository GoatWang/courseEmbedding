Job Details
               SHB is committed to the professional growth and development of its attorneys. To carry out that commitment, the firm has created a Professional Development Committee made up of about 30 lawyers from a variety of offices, practice groups and experience levels. The committee's chair is Mark Cowing, an attorney in the Kansas City office. At the core of our professional development curriculum is our trial practice series, which emphasizes learning by doing and begins in an associate's first year. Classes and workshops include Basic Litigation Skills, Deposition Practice, Negotiation Practice, Motion Practice, Basic Trial Practice, and Advanced Trial Practice. After participants complete a course, we follow-up with them one-on-one to ensure that they have an opportunity to put their training to use in their litigation assignments. Beyond the trial practice series, we offer seminars that focus on the two most important skills for every lawyer - writing and speaking - as well as a wide range of programs based on an attorney's experience level (e.g., basic training for new associates) and practice group (e.g., Hot Employment Topics for Real World Practitioners). These programs give lawyers in all offices regular access to the firm's most accomplished practitioners. The committee also produces advanced, relevant, practical CLE courses that range from monthly 60-minute webcasts to annual full-day programs such as the Corporate Counsel Institute and the Update of the Law. Internal programs are accredited in all states where we have offices. Public programs are typically accredited in the 20 states most frequently requested by our attorneys, clients, and guests.  The lawyers resident in all offices, unless otherwise indicated, are not certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization. See our Disclaimer and Privacy Policy.
