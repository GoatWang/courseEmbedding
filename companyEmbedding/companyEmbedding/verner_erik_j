Description:

CROSS-REFERENCE This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Applications Ser. Nos. 60/461,286 and 60/464,448, filed on Apr. 7, 2003, and Apr. 21, 2003, respectively. The disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to certain hydroxamate derivatives that are useful in the treatment of hepatitis C. These compounds are also inhibitors of histone deacetylase and are therefore useful in the treatment of diseases associated with histone deacetylase activity. Pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing these compounds are also disclosed. 2. State of the Art Hepatitis C: Chronic hepatitis C is a slowly progressive disease having a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. While many patients who contract hepatitis C will have sub clinical or mild disease, at least 80% of the individuals who contract HCV develop chronic infection and hepatitis. Twenty to fifty percent of these eventually progress to cirrhosis and 1-2% develop liver cancer (Hoofnagle, J. H.; 1997; Hepatology 26: 15S-20S). There are an estimated 170 million HCV carriers world-wide, and HCV-associated end-stage liver disease is now one of the leading cause of liver transplantation. In the United States alone, hepatitis C is responsible for 8,000 to 10,000 deaths annually. At the present time, interferon-α2b/ribavirin combination therapy is the only available treatment. Sustained virologic response to IFN-α2b -ribavirin combination therapy occurs in about 40-45% of those treated. For those patients who fail interferon-α2b/ribavirin combination therapy, there is currently no alternative to prevent the progression of liver disease. Thus, a need exists for alternative therapies for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The present invention fulfills this need. Histone Deacetylases: Interest in histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) as targets for pharmaceutical development has centered on the role of HDACs in regulating genes associated with cell-cycle progression and the development and progression of cancer (reviewed in Kramer et. al. 2001. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 12:294-300). Several studies have shown that treatment of various cell lines with HDAC inhibitors leads to hyper acetylation of histone proteins and cell-cycle arrest in late G1 phase or at the G2/M transition. Genes involved in the cell cycle that have been shown to be up regulated by HDAC inhibitors include p21, p27, p53 and cyclin E. Cyclin A and cyclin D have been reported to be down regulated by HDAC inhibitors. In tumor cell lines, several studies have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors can lead to growth inhibition, growth arrest, terminal differentiation and/or apoptosis. In vivo studies have demonstrated growth inhibition of tumors and a reduction in tumor metastasis as a result of treatment with HDAC inhibitors. The clearest link between abnormal HDAC activity and cancer occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this condition, a chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor RARα with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) proteins. Both PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα promote the progression of leukemia by repressing retinoic acid-regulated genes through the abnormal recruitment of SMRT-mSin3-HDAC complex (Lin et. al., 1998, Nature 391:811-814; Grignani et al., 1998, Nature 391:815-818). Whereas the PML-RARα form of the disease is treatable with retinoic acid, the PLZF-RARα form is resistant to this treatment. For a patient with the retinoic acid-resistant form of the disease, the addition of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate to the dosing regimen led to complete clinical and cytogenic remission (Warrell et al., 1998, J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 90:1621-1625). HDACs have also been associated with Huntington's disease (Steffan, et al., Nature 413:739-744, “Histone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila”). In summary, an increase in HDAC activity contributes to the pathology and/or symptomatology of a number of diseases. Accordingly, molecules that inhibit the activity of HDAC are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such diseases.

The present invention also includes the prodrugs of compounds of Formula (I). The term prodrug is intended to represent covalently bonded carriers, which are capable of releasing the active ingredient of Formula (I) when the prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Release of the active ingredient occurs in vivo. Prodrugs can be prepared by techniques known to one skilled in the art. These techniques generally modify appropriate functional groups in a given compound. These modified functional groups however regenerate original functional groups by routine manipulation or in vivo. Prodrugs of compounds of Formula (I) include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino, carboxylic, or a similar group is modified. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to esters (e.g., acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives), carbamates (e.g., N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl) of hydroxy or amino functional groups in compounds of Formula (I)), amides (e.g., trifluoroacetylamino, acetylamino, and the like), and the like. Prodrugs of compounds of Formula (I) are also within the scope of this invention. The present invention also includes N-oxide derivatives and protected derivatives of compounds of Formula (I). For example, when compounds of Formula (I) contain an oxidizable nitrogen atom, the nitrogen atom can be converted to an N-oxide by methods well known in the art. When compounds of Formula (I) contain groups such as hydroxy, carboxy, thiol or any group containing a nitrogen atom(s), these groups can be protected with a suitable protecting groups. A comprehensive list of suitable protective groups can be found in T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1981, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The protected derivatives of compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by methods well known in the art. “Phenylene” means a divalent phenyl radical.

General Synthesis Compounds of this invention can be made by the methods depicted in the reaction scheme shown below. The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds are either available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co., (Milwaukee, Wis.), Bachem (Torrance, Calif.), or Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.) or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991); Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989); Organic Reactions, Volumes 140 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, (John Wiley and Sons, 4th Edition) and Larock's Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989). These schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of this invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to this disclosure. The starting materials and the intermediates of the reaction may be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography and the like. Such materials may be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data. Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein take place at atmospheric pressure over a temperature range from about −78° C. to about 150° C., more preferably from about 0° C. to about 125° C. and most preferably at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20° C. Compounds of Formula (I) where X is —O— or —S(O)n— where n is 0 to 2 and other groups are as described in the Summary of the Invention can be prepared by the procedure illustrated and described in Scheme A below.  

Reaction of a compound of formula I where R is alkyl, X is —O— or —S— and Ar1 is as defined in the Summary of the Invention with an aminoalcohol of formula 2 where PG is a suitable amino protecting group provides a compound of formula 3. The reaction is carried out in the presence of triphenylphosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate in a suitable organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, and the like. Compounds of formula I such as methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, methyl 4-mercaptobenzoate, and methyl 3-hydroxyisoxazole-5-carboxylate are commercially available. Compounds of formula 2 can be prepared from commercially available aminoalcohols by reacting the amine with a suitable amino protecting group such as benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl and the like under reaction conditions well known in the art. A detailed description of suitable amino protecting groups and reaction conditions for their preparation can be found in T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1981 the teaching of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Aminoalcohols such as 2-ethanolamine, 2-amino-1-propanol, 2-methylaminoethanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-amino-1-propanol, 4-amino-2-butanol, and 1-amino-2-butanol are commercially available. Alternatively, compounds of formula 2 can be prepared from commercially available aminoacids by protecting the amino group with a suitable protecting group followed by reduction of the acid group to the hydroxy group with a suitable reducing agent under conditions well known in the art. If compounds of Formula (1) where X is —SO2— are desired, the corresponding compound of formula 3 where X is —S— can be treated with an oxidizing agent such as OXONE®, m-chloroperbenzoic acid, and the like. Removal of the amino protecting group in 3 provides a compound of formula 4. The reaction conditions employed for removal of the amino protecting group depend on the nature of the protecting group. For example, if the protecting group is tert-butoxycarbonyl, it is removed under acid reaction conditions. Suitable acids are trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like in a suitable organic solvent such as methanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and the like. If the protecting group is benzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl, it is removed under catalytic hydrogenation reaction conditions. Suitable catalyst are palladium based catalysts and others known in the art. Other suitable reaction conditions for their removal can be found in T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1981. The reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like. Reaction of 4 with an acid or acid derivative (e.g., acid halide) of formula Ar2-COZ where Z is hydroxy or halo provides a compound of formula 5. Again, the reaction conditions employed depend on the nature of the Z group. If Z is hydroxy, the reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a suitable coupling agent e.g., benzdtriazole-1-yloxy-trispyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP®), O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC. HCl), or 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT. H2O), and a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, and the like. The reaction is typically carried out at 20 to 30° C., preferably at about 25° C., and requires 2 to 24 hours to complete. Suitable reaction solvents are inert organic solvents such as halogenated organic solvents (e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, and the like), acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethereal solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like. Preferably, the reaction is carried out with HOBt. H2O, EDC.HCl in dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide. When Ar2COZ is an acid halide, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, and the like). Suitable reaction solvents are polar organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylfornamide (DMF), dichloromethane, or any suitable mixtures thereof. The acid halide such as acid chloride can be prepared by reacting the corresponding acids with a halogenating agent such as oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, and the like. Acids of formula Ar2COZ are either commercially available or they can be prepared from commercially available starting materials by methods known in the art. For example, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, phenylacetic acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, 3-methylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid, and benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid are commercially available. Others such as 3-phenoxymethylbenzofluran-2-carboxylic acid can be readily prepared from commercially available 3-methylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid by first converting it to 2-bromomethylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid (brominating it with N-bromosuccinimide under conditions well known in the art) followed by reacting with phenol. Compound 5 where R3 is hydrogen can optionally be converted to a corresponding compound of formula 5 where R3 is other than hydrogen by reacting it with an alkylating agent under conditions well known in the art. Compound 5 is then converted to a compound of Formula (I) by reacting it with aqueous hydroxylamine in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide and a mixture of organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and methanol. Alternatively, the acid group in 5 is first activated with a suitable coupling agent such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC. HCl), or 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT. H2O) in a suitable organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, and the like, and then reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, and the like. Compounds of Formula (I) can also be prepared from compound 5 by the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,412, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. 105431 A compound of Formula (I) can be converted to other compounds of Formula (1). For example, a compound of Formula (I) where Ar1 is phenylene, X is —O—, Y is ethylene, Ar2 is 3-dimethylaminomethylbenzofuran-2-yl, R1 and R3 are hydrogen can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 4 where Ar1 is phenylene, X is —O—, Y is ethylene, and R is alkyl with 3-methylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid as described above to give a compound of formula 5 where Ar2 is 3-methylbenzofuran-2-yl. Bromination of the methyl group with a suitable brominating agent such as N-bromosuccinimide, followed by reaction with dimethylamine provides the corresponding 3-dimethylaminobenzofuran-2-yl compound which is then converted to the desired compound under the reaction conditions described above.

Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions In general, the compounds of this invention will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of the compound of this invention, i.e., the active ingredient, will depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, and other factors. Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of Formula (I) may range from approximately 0.1-50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day; preferably about 0.5-20 mg/kg/day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would most preferably be about 35 mg to 1.4 g per day. In general, compounds of this invention will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository), or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral or parenteral using a convenient daily dosage regimen, which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Oral compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate compositions. The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration (e.g., for oral administration, formulations in the form of tablets, pills or capsules are preferred) and the bioavailability of the drug substance. Recently, pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability. The compositions are comprised of in general, a compound of Formula (I) in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound of Formula (1). Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art. Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols. Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of this invention in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc. Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, edited by E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Company, 18th ed., 1990). The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight percent (wt %) basis, from about 0.01-99.99 wt % of a compound of Formula (I) based on the total formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 1-80 wt %. Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of Formula (I) are described below. As stated previously, the compounds of this invention can be administered in combination with known anti-cancer agents. Such known anti-cancer agents include the following: estrogen receptor modulators, androgen receptor modulators, retinoid receptor modulators, cytotoxic agents, antiproliferative agents, prenyl-protein transferase inhibitors, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, DNA methyl tranferase inhibitors, and other angiogenesis inhibitors.

The term also refers to antagonists of any combination of αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, αvβ8, α1β1, α2β1, α5β1, α6β1 and α5β4 integrins. Some specific examples of tyrosine kinase inhibitors include N-(trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-methylisoxazol4-carboxamide, 3-[(2,4-dimethylpyrrol-5-yl)methylidenyl)indolin-2-one, 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, 4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-7-methoxy-6-[3-(4-morpholinyl)propoxyl]quinazoline, N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)4-quinazolinamine, BIBX1382, 2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-(hydroxymethyl)-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-9,12-epoxy -1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3′,2′,1′-k1]pyrrolo[3,4-1,6]benzodiazocin-1-one, SH268, genistein, ST1571, CEP2563, 4-(3-chlorophenylamino)-5,6-dimethyl-7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyrimidinemethane sulfonate, 4-(3-bromo4-hydroxyphenyl)amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, 4-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, SU6668, SU11248, STI571A, N-4-chlorophenyl-4-(4-pyridylmethyl)-1-phthalazinamine, and EMD121974. The instant compounds are also useful, alone or in combination with platelet fibrinogen receptor (GP Iib/IIIa) antagonists, such as tirofiban, to inhibit metastasis of cancerous cells. Tumor cells can activate platelets largely via thrombin generation. This activation is associated with the release of VEGF. The release of VEGF enhances metastasis by increasing extravasation at points of adhesion to vascular endothelium (Amirkhosravi, Platelets 10, 285-292, 1999). Therefore, the present compounds can serve to inhibit metastasis, alone or in combination with GP Iib/IIIa) antagonists. Examples of other fibrinogen receptor antagonists include abciximab, eptifibatide, sibrafiban, lamifiban, lotrafiban, cromofiban, and CT50352. “DNA methyltransferase inhibitor” refers to compounds which inhibit the methylation of the DNA base cytosine at the C-5 position of that base by the DNA methyltransferase enzyme. Examples of such DNA methyltransferase inhibitor include compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,329,412 and 6,268,137. Specific DNA methyltransferase inhibitors include 5-azacytosine and zebularine®. If formulated as a fixed dose, such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the dosage range described above and the other pharmaceutically active agent(s) within its approved dosage range. Compounds of the instant invention may alternatively be used sequentially with known pharmaceutically acceptable agent(s) when a combination formulation is inappropriate. The term administration and variants thereof (erg., “administering” a compound) in reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment. When a compound of the invention or prodrug thereof is provided in combination with one or more other active agents (e.g., a cytotoxic agent, etc.), “administration” and its variants are each understood to include concurrent and sequential introduction of the compound or prodrug thereof and other agents. As used herein, the term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. The compounds of the instant invention may also be co-administered with other well known therapeutic agents that are selected for their particular usefulness against the condition that is being treated. For example, the compounds of the instant invention may also be co-administered with other well known cancer therapeutic agents that are selected for their particular usefulness against the condition that is being treated. Included in such combinations of therapeutic agents are combinations of the farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitors disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,138 and an antineoplastic agent. It is also understood that such a combination of antineoplastic agent and inhibitor of farnesyl-protein transferase may be used in conjunction with other methods of treating cancer and/or tumors, including radiation therapy and surgery. Examples of an antineoplastic agent include, in general, microtubule-stabilizing agents (such as paclitaxel (also known as Taxol®, docetaxel (also known as Taxotere®, epothilone A, epothilone B, desoxyepothilone A, desoxyepothilone B or their derivatives); microtubule-disruptor agents; alkylating agents, anti-metabolites; epidophyllotoxin; an antineoplastic enzyme; a topoisomerase inhibitor; procarbazine; mitoxantrone; platinum coordination complexes; biological response modifiers and growth inhibitors; hormonal/anti-hormonal therapeutic agents and haematopoietic growth factors.

After the product began to crystallize, methanol (150 ml) was added slowly over thirty min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature then cooled to 0-5° C. and stirred another hour. The crystals were filtered and washed with methanol (40 ml) before being dried in vacuo to give 3-dimethylaminomethylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid [2-(4-hydroxy-carbamoylphenoxy)ethyl]amide (11.88 g) as a white solid. The crude material (13.25 g, 0.033 mol) was suspended in N,N-dimethylformamide (80 ml) and heated to 100° C. to give a solution. After cooling, ethanol (80 ml) was added drop-wise over thirty minutes and the resulting suspension was allowed to cool for an hour. The crystals were filtered and washed with ethanol (40 ml) and dried to give pure product (9.82 g) as a white solid. Step 7 N-hydroxy-4-[2-(3-dimethylaminobenzofuran-2-ylcarbonylamino)ethoxy]-benzamide (22.7 g, 0.057 mol) was suspended in 2-propanol (220 ml). 12 M HCl (5.2 ml, 0.063 mol) was added in one portion and the resulting mixture was heated to reflux. Water (44 ml) was added dropwise until a homogenous solution was obtained. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool and crystallize overnight. After cooling below 5° C. for one h, the crystals were filtered and washed with 2-propanol before being dried in vacuo to to give the title compound (22.0 g) as a white solid.

After 1h, a solution of Boc-ethanolamine (3.22 g, 20 mmol) in THF (10 ml) was added. After 20 min., a solution of methyl 4-mercaptobenzoate (3.86 g, 20 mmol) in THF (10 ml) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated and ethyl acetate (150 ml) was added. The solution was washed with 1M HCl, saturated aqueous NaHCO3, brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The oily yellow residue was eluted through a plug of silica gel (0-20 ethyl acetate in hexane as mobile phase) and the product was then recrystallized from ether and hexane to give methyl 4-(2-tert-butoxycarbonylaminoethylsulfanyl)benzoate (4.00 g). Step 2 A solution of methyl 4-(2-tert-butoxycarbonylaminoethylsulfanyl)benzoate (1.00 g, 3.21 mmol) in dichloromethane (8 ml) was treated with a solution of HCl in dioxane (4M, 8 ml, 10 eq.) at room temperature for 3 h. Ether (100 ml) was added and the mixture was filtered, washed with ether and pumped dry to give methyl 4-(2-aminoethylsulfanyl)benzoate hydrochloride.

Example 4 Synthesis of acetyl-Gly-Ala-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC tert-Boc (N-Acetyl-Lys)-AMC (445 mg, 1mmol, purchased from Bachem) was dissolved in 4 M HCL in dioxane to provide H-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC as a white solid. To a solution of H-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC in DMF (5 ml) was added Ac-Gly-Ala-OH (188 mg, 1 mmol) using PyBOP (520 mg, 1 mmol), HOBt (135 mg, 1 mmol), and NMM (0.296 ml, 2 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and monitored by MS/LC for the presence of H-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC. Additional amounts of PyBOP (260 mg, 0.5 mmol), HOBt (70 mg, 0.5 mmol), and NMM (0.146 ml, 1 mmol) was added and the stirring was continued for additional 4 h after which the product was isolated in quantitative yield. Biological Examples Example 1 Inhibition of HDAC in Vitro The HDAC inhibitory activity of the compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows. Measurements were performed in a reaction volume of 100 μL using 96-well assay plates. HDAC-1 (200 pM final concentration) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 0.001% Tween-20, 5% DMSO, pH 7.4) was mixed with inhibitor at various concentrations and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes, after which trypsin and acetyl-Gly-Ala-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC were added to final concentrations of 50 nM and 25 μM, respectively, to initiate the reaction. Negative control reactions were performed in the absence of inhibitor in replicates of eight. The reactions were monitored in a fluorescence plate reader. After a 30 minute lag time, the fluorescence was measured over a 30 minute time frame using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and a detection wavelength of 460 nm. The increase in fluorescence with time was used as the measure of the reaction rate. Inhibition constants were obtained using the program BatchKi (Kuzmic et al. Anal. Biochem. 2000, 286, 45-50). Most of the compounds of this invention had a Ki of <40 nm. Example 2 Cell Proliferation Assay in Vitro The ability of the compounds of Formula (I) to inhibit growth of tumor cells in vitro was determined as follows. Stock cultures of the HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37° C. in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were cultured in 75-cm2 culture flasks and subcultures were established every 3 to 4 days so as not to allow the cells to exceed 90% confluence. HCTI 16 cells were harvested for proliferation assays by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA), washed twice in culture medium, re-suspended in appropriate volume of medium, and then counted using a hemacytometer. Cells were seeded in wells of flat-bottom 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cell/well in 100 μl. Cells were allowed to attach for 1.5 to 2 hours at 37° C. Compounds were diluted from 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO. Serial 3-fold dilutions were performed in medium containing 0.6% DMSO in wells (in triplicate) of a 96-well U-bottom plates starting with a 60 μM solution. After dilutions were completed, 100 μl of each compound dilution (in triplicate) was transferred to designated triplicate wells of the 96-well plate containing cells in 100 μl of medium. Final concentrations of the dose-response for compounds in assay plates ranged from 0.12 to 30 μM. Control wells (cells with no treatment) received 100 μl of 0.6% DMSO in culture medium. Wells containing medium with no cells served as the background wells. Cells were cultured with the compounds for 48 and 72 hours at 37° C. in a humidified CO2 incubator. Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring fluorescence after the addition of the fluorogenic redox indicator, Alamar Blue™ (BioSource International). Ten μl of Alamar Blue™ was added to each well of the 96-well plate(s) 3 to 4 hours prior to the end of the incubation period. Assay plates were read in a fluorescence plate reader (excitation, 530 nM; emission, 620 nM). G150 values (concentration at which the growth of the tumor cells was inhibited by 50%) for compounds were determined by plotting the percent control fluorescence against the logarithm of the compound concentration. The compounds of this invention inhibited the growth of the tumor cells.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.
