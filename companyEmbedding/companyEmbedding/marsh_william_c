Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in North Carolina:













Does Marsh William C carry a valid contracting license?



In North Carolina a construction project with costs of $30,000 or more requires a contractor to be licensed.
Marsh William C currently holds license 44674 (Highway, Building), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in North Carolina?



Contractors in North Carolina must take an exam administered by PSI licensure certification in order to become licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Marsh William C



Although state law does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance, hiring contractors who do have an active policy of each insurance is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate for your records before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Marsh William C



Contractors in North Carolina do not have to obtain a surety bond to perform work on residential properties. Homeowners have financial recourse in North Carolina through The Homeowners Recovery Fund, which provides assistance to eligible North Carolina homeowners who have suffered a financial loss caused by the dishonest or incompetent conduct of a licensed general contractor.











What else should I know before hiring Marsh William C



Licensed contractors must furnish proof of financial responsibility to obtain a limited, intermediate, or unlimited license according to a company's working capital. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

William C. Marsh, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton, has been elected Chairman of the Pennsylvania Bankers Association (PBA).  As Chairman, Marsh will lead Pennsylvania’s largest banking trade association for a one-year term beginning July 1.
The Pennsylvania Bankers Association, located in Harrisburg, is the state’s leading banking trade association, representing an expansive and diverse membership. The Association offers extensive Continuing Education programs and government relations representation on behalf of the industry, and provides numerous products and services for banks and their employees.
William C. Marsh, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Farmers National Bank noted, “The mission statement of the Association supports our Bank’s goals.  Our Bank has been a member of the PBA for decades and has a tradition of collaboration with the Association and its efforts.  Our employees regularly realize the benefits of their training programs and seminars.  We have been active on the Board of Directors of the Association, with committee service, banking schools, training, and with Group 8 activities.  This is a big honor for Farmers National Bank, and I look forward to serving the PBA throughout the year.”
Mr. Marsh has served as Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton and its parent holding company, Emclaire Financial Corp., since June of 2009. He began working at the Bank in 2001 as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer before serving as the President and Chief Executive Officer in June of 2007. Prior to this, Mr. Marsh served in similar finance executive positions with publicly traded community banks in western Pennsylvania and Maryland, and served as a manager in the financial services audit practice of KPMG, LLP in Pittsburgh, PA. Mr. Marsh is a graduate of Clarion University of Pennsylvania and a certified public accountant licensed in Pennsylvania. 
The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton is an independent, nationally chartered, FDIC-insured community commercial bank headquartered in Emlenton, Pennsylvania, operating fifteen full-service offices in Venango, Butler, Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Jefferson, and Mercer Counties, Pennsylvania. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emclaire Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: “EMCF”).
