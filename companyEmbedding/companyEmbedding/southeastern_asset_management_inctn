About Us






Overview
Southeastern Asset Management is a privately owned, global investment management firm founded in 1975 and the investment advisor to the Longleaf Partners Funds.  We have consistently employed a time-tested value approach to long-only equity investing for over four decades with a long-term time horizon in strong businesses with good people at deeply discounted prices.  We seek to reduce risk and deliver positive absolute returns for our investors over time.
Led by our CEO and Founder, Mason Hawkins, and Vice-Chairman, Staley Cates, we invest across four mandates for our institutional clients: U.S. Large Cap, U.S. Small Cap, Non-U.S., and Global.  Slightly over half of our total assets under management are in separately managed accounts for institutional clients, while the remainder is invested in the Longleaf Partners Funds, a suite of mutual funds and UCITS funds.
We created the Longleaf Partners Funds in 1987 to enable our employees to invest alongside our clients.  This alignment of incentives is a critical element of the firm’s ethos and code of ethics still today.  Collectively, Southeastern’s employees and affiliates are the largest shareholders in the Longleaf Funds.
Our concentrated portfolios include 18-22 positions of our highest-conviction ideas.  We take a long-term view with our investments and select companies where we believe management is capable and shareholder-oriented, and engage with management to further enhance shareholder value.

History[edit]
Southeastern Asset Management was founded by Mason Hawkins in 1975. In 1987, Southeastern created the Longleaf Partners Fund, its first mutual fund product, in order to allow its employees to invest in the funds owned by its clients. The Longleaf Small-Cap Fund was seeded two years later in 1989 as a way to invest in undervalued businesses that were too small for the firm’s existing portfolios. The Small-Cap Fund later closed to new investors in 1997 and remains closed today.[9][10]
Longleaf Partners Mutual Funds[edit]
The Longleaf Partners Funds is a suite of mutual fund and UCITS fund products introduced into the market by Southeastern Asset Management in 1987 as a way for Southeastern employees to invest in the funds they managed. Southeastern's employees and their immediate families are limited by the firm’s code of ethics to invest in public equities through the firm's funds unless granted an exception.[11]
Longleaf’s flagship fund, Longleaf Partners Fund, was launched in 1987 and was later followed by Longleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund in 1989, Longleaf Partners International Fund in 1998, and Longleaf Partners Global Fund in 2012.[10][12]
Separately Managed Accounts[edit]
Southeastern provides separately managed accounts for institutional investors with three mandates: U.S., Non-U.S. and Global. Its U.S. mandate dates back to 1975 and its Non-U.S. mandate began in 1998. In 2000, Southeastern created its Global separately managed account mandate for institutional investors, combining U.S. and non-U.S. companies in one portfolio in 2000.[13]
Longleaf Partners UCITS Funds[edit]
Longleaf Partners’ Global UCITS fund was created in 2010 for investors outside of the U.S.[14] In 2012, the Longleaf Partners U.S. UCITS Fund was launched for investors outside of the U.S. to invest in U.S.-based companies.[14]
Leadership[edit]
Mason Hawkins[edit]
Mason Hawkins is the Founder, Chairman and Chief executive officer of Southeastern Asset Management, Inc. He has been in the investment business for more than 40 years and has been the recipient of various industry awards throughout his career, including Institutional Investor’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received in 2005.[15]
Prior to founding Southeastern, Hawkins was the Director of Research at Atlantic National Bank from 1972 to 1973 and then held the same position at the First Tennessee Investment Management from 1974 to 1975.[16]
Hawkins earned a B.A. in Finance from the University of Florida and an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Georgia. He also holds the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.[17][18]
Staley Cates[edit]
Staley Cates is the President and Chief investment officer of Southeastern Asset Management. He joined Southeastern in 1986 after graduating from the University of Texas with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. In 1994, he took over as President of Southeastern Asset Management.[19]
Prior to joining Southeastern, Cates worked as a research associate at Morgan Keegan & Company. He has more than 29 years of investment experience.[20][21]

History[edit]
Southeastern Asset Management was founded by Mason Hawkins in 1975. In 1987, Southeastern created the Longleaf Partners Fund, its first mutual fund product, in order to allow its employees to invest in the funds owned by its clients. The Longleaf Small-Cap Fund was seeded two years later in 1989 as a way to invest in undervalued businesses that were too small for the firm’s existing portfolios. The Small-Cap Fund later closed to new investors in 1997 and remains closed today.[9][10]
Longleaf Partners Mutual Funds[edit]
The Longleaf Partners Funds is a suite of mutual fund and UCITS fund products introduced into the market by Southeastern Asset Management in 1987 as a way for Southeastern employees to invest in the funds they managed. Southeastern's employees and their immediate families are limited by the firm’s code of ethics to invest in public equities through the firm's funds unless granted an exception.[11]
Longleaf’s flagship fund, Longleaf Partners Fund, was launched in 1987 and was later followed by Longleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund in 1989, Longleaf Partners International Fund in 1998, and Longleaf Partners Global Fund in 2012.[10][12]
Separately Managed Accounts[edit]
Southeastern provides separately managed accounts for institutional investors with three mandates: U.S., Non-U.S. and Global. Its U.S. mandate dates back to 1975 and its Non-U.S. mandate began in 1998. In 2000, Southeastern created its Global separately managed account mandate for institutional investors, combining U.S. and non-U.S. companies in one portfolio in 2000.[13]
Longleaf Partners UCITS Funds[edit]
Longleaf Partners’ Global UCITS fund was created in 2010 for investors outside of the U.S.[14] In 2012, the Longleaf Partners U.S. UCITS Fund was launched for investors outside of the U.S. to invest in U.S.-based companies.[14]
Leadership[edit]
Mason Hawkins[edit]
Mason Hawkins is the Founder, Chairman and Chief executive officer of Southeastern Asset Management, Inc. He has been in the investment business for more than 40 years and has been the recipient of various industry awards throughout his career, including Institutional Investor’s Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received in 2005.[15]
Prior to founding Southeastern, Hawkins was the Director of Research at Atlantic National Bank from 1972 to 1973 and then held the same position at the First Tennessee Investment Management from 1974 to 1975.[16]
Hawkins earned a B.A. in Finance from the University of Florida and an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Georgia. He also holds the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.[17][18]
Staley Cates[edit]
Staley Cates is the President and Chief investment officer of Southeastern Asset Management. He joined Southeastern in 1986 after graduating from the University of Texas with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. In 1994, he took over as President of Southeastern Asset Management.[19]

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
