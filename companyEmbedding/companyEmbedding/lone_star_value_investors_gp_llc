What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lone Star Value Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, "Lone Star Value", "we", or "us") is a significant, long-term shareholder of Ciber, Inc. ("Ciber" or the "Company") (NYSE:   CBR) with ownership of approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock.  Lone Star Value announced today that it delivered a formal notice to Ciber of its intention to nominate three director candidates for election to the board of directors of Ciber (the "Board") at the upcoming 2015 annual meeting of Ciber shareholders (the "2015 Annual Meeting").
Lone Star Value is dedicated to enhancing shareholder value and improving shareholder rights for ALL Ciber shareholders.  In our view, upgrading the incumbent Board is a critical first step for shareholders to realize our goals. Lone Star Value believes that Ciber's stock is deeply undervalued due in large part to failures of oversight by the incumbent Board and poor corporate governance.  We fear many of the incumbent Board members are more focused on their director fees and the prestige of serving on a public board in their hometown of Denver, than they are on maximizing value for Ciber's shareholders.  During Chairman Jacobs' tenure as a Board member, for example, CBR stock has declined by more than 45%(1) while he has made over $1.2 million in director fees.(2)  In addition, average Board member compensation during Chairman Jacobs' tenure has risen from approximately $40,000 per year to approximately $200,000 per year(3) and is paid mainly in cash -- not the compensation terms shareholders want to see in a turnaround situation.  As a sign of a poorly performing Board, management team turnover has been alarmingly high over the past ten years with four different CEOs and four different CFOs.  We believe the incumbent Board, until very recently, has repeatedly failed to find a suitable CEO to lead the Company toward profitability and performance in line with its peers.  Ciber's dismal operating performance, for example, is represented by a cumulative net loss to shareholders of more than $193 million ($2.69/share) since 2010 in GAAP earnings and it has reported annual net losses in GAAP earnings every year since 2010, while its industry peers were much more profitable during this time period.(4)
To be clear, we have tremendous confidence in Ciber's new CEO, Michael Boustridge.  We believe he and his management team are beginning to execute on a long-awaited turnaround of Ciber's operations as evidenced by Ciber's improved financial results in Q4 2014.  Of course the incumbent Board will try to take credit for hiring Mr. Boustridge as CEO, but it should be pointed out that the incumbent Board only hired Mr. Boustridge as CEO after our activist effort was initiated a year ago, after Lone Star Value gained representation on the Board, and after it had become undeniable that the previous CEO, David Peterschmidt, hired by Chairman Paul Jacobs, had been a failure over his 4-year tenure.  We also have deep respect for Ciber Board member and Company founder Bobby Stevenson, both for founding the Company and for owning almost 8% of its stock.  Unlike the other Board members, we believe Mr. Stevenson thinks like an owner and is much more focused on shareholder value creation than his director fees.
We believe this Board has failed in one of the most important roles for any board -- recruiting the right management talent and creating the right incentives by compensating them based on performance.  Ciber's unfortunate history with its former CEO, Mr. Peterschmidt, is a strong example of the Board's failure in this regard.  Chairman Jacobs hired David Peterschmidt as CEO in July 2010, a time when Ciber was in desperate need of a turnaround, but, unfortunately, Mr. Peterschmidt had no turnaround expertise.  Two years into Mr. Peterschmidt's tenure, the Board had apparently become concerned about his performance and decided to appoint Mr. Boustridge to the Board so he could step in as CEO if needed.  A direct quote from Chairman Jacobs in 2014 clearly explains the reasoning behind adding Mr. Boustridge to the Board in 2012: "Michael was brought onto our Board two years ago with succession planning in mind.  We are fortunate to have a strong and qualified candidate, with global operating experience.  And, because Michael has been on our Board, he has a perspective of the role that no outside candidate could bring".(5)
Yet despite every indication that Mr. Peterschmidt was grossly underperforming and had been for two years, the Board did nothing about it for another two years.  It was not until Lone Star Value launched a campaign to seek change on the Board in 2014 that Ciber's incumbent directors finally took action to replace the failed CEO.  Even then, this Board, which well knew that Mr. Boustridge would replace Mr. Peterschmidt as CEO, still renewed Mr. Peterschmidt's contract on March 25, 2014 and kept him on the payroll as a consultant for an additional year after his replacement as CEO.  This Board, led by Chairman Jacobs, "rewarded" Mr. Peterschmidt with an exit package worth more than $2.6 million.(6)  Mr. Peterschmidt's exit package included a $710,000 one-year consulting contract, 350,000 CBR shares, medical benefits, moving costs from Colorado to California, closing costs related to the sale of Mr. Peterschmidt's home, and the cost of renewing his Executive's status as a Global Services member on United Airlines for two years.(7)  We believe Mr. Peterschmidt's superfluous addition to his compensation package was completely unnecessary and not required by his employment contract – essentially, it was a tip.
While presiding over a period of disruptive management turnover and unnecessary compensation practices, the Board has also continually had poor corporate governance, which is a sure sign of an entrenched Board.  The Board has shown little appetite for fresh perspective in the boardroom with barely any turnover over the last 10 years.  Further, the Board has sought to stifle shareholders' ability to seek change on the Board through, among other things, a classified board structure and an absolute prohibition on the shareholders' ability to call special meetings or act by written consent.  Leading proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholders Services (ISS), rates Ciber's overall corporate governance with the lowest possible governance score of 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 indicating maximum corporate governance risk.  Two specific corporate governance areas have been highlighted by ISS in its 10 grade maximum governance risk rating – shareholder rights and executive compensation.
Furthermore, through the course of our involvement with Ciber, the Board has shown disregard for shareholder input and nonchalance in breaking its contractual commitments to shareholders.  Last year, pursuant to an agreement with Lone Star Value, the incumbent Board agreed to add a shareholder representative on the Board, Richard Coleman, who has added tremendous value in the boardroom and whom we are re-nominating for election to the Board this year. In our agreement, the Board committed to actively search for two additional Board members in order to upgrade and enhance the talent on the Board.(8)  In the year since then, one director, Betsy Atkins, joined the Board, but promptly resigned after only three months.  Other than that, there is no evidence that the Board took its obligations to upgrade and enhance the talent on the Board seriously.  In failing to replace Ms. Atkins and to add an additional new director, the Board led by Mr. Jacobs failed to honor its responsibilities to shareholders and its agreement with us.
Lone Star Value has clearly expressed its views on the urgent need for improvement of Ciber's Board and corporate governance practices to Chairman Jacobs in numerous calls and emails.  The incumbent Board has so far refused to make the necessary changes to avoid a proxy contest.  We have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the behavior of the incumbent Board will not change unless the personnel changes.  We are convinced that reconstituting the Board is imperative to improving shareholder value and rights.  An upgraded Board will be in a far stronger position to help the new management team in their continuing turnaround efforts at Ciber.  
Accordingly, Lone Star Value today submitted formal nominations of three highly-qualified director candidates, Richard K. Coleman, Jr., Robert G. Pearse, and Joshua Schechter, for election to the Board at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  Our nominees' experience encompasses technology, telecom, business services, financial, and turnaround expertise.  Messrs. Coleman, Pearse, and Schechter not only possess substantial and relevant turnaround experience and a well-balanced mix of skills but each also boasts an exceptional track record of creating shareholder value.  Each is committed to the highest levels of corporate governance.  These proven value-creators will ensure that the Company evaluates, with an open mind and a keen sense of urgency, all strategic alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders.
If elected by our fellow shareholders, our highly-qualified and experienced Board nominees will immediately seek to align the Company's interests with maximizing shareholder value, improving the fundamental operations of the business to an operational level on par with its direct competitors, and steer the Company toward long-term profitability.  Our goal is to inject a sense of urgency, while implementing a coherent strategy between the Board and management team, which will ultimately yield an increase in shareholder value.
Shareholders can no longer put their faith in the incumbent Board that has historically eroded shareholder value, delayed Ciber's needed operating turnaround, and stubbornly refused to implement proactive change on the Board.  At this stage, change on the Board should be made by the shareholders and for the shareholders. We believe that ONLY THE SHAREHOLDERS and not the incumbent Board should be allowed to choose new directors.  We caution the Board against thinly veiled reactive measures to entrench themselves under the guise of proactive action.  We further remind the incumbent directors of their fiduciary duty to shareholders, particularly in the context of any potential proxy contest, and that actions taken in violation of shareholder rights and destructive of shareholder value may expose incumbent directors to liability that exceeds any D&O insurance coverage.
Lone Star Value remains open to a meaningful dialogue with the Board regarding its composition and corporate strategy and remains amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to re-constitute the Board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders.  If no agreement is reached, however, Lone Star Value is fully prepared to solicit the support of its fellow shareholders to elect all three of its director nominees at the 2015 Annual Meeting.  Our nominees, if elected, will take their fiduciary responsibility very seriously and will represent the interests of ALL shareholders.
Lone Star Value's independent and highly-qualified candidates are:
Richard K. Coleman, Jr., age 58, is the founder and President of Rocky Mountain Venture Services.  Since 1998, his company has helped businesses plan and launch new ventures and restructuring initiatives.  As a private investor and advisor, Mr. Coleman envisions, develops, and executes strategic changes, often serving as an interim executive and/or board member.  Mr. Coleman is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of Crossroads Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:  CRDS) ("Crossroads Systems"), a global provider of data archive solutions, a position he has held since November 2013.  He has also served on the Board of Directors of Crossroads since April 2013. Previously, he served as the interim President and CEO of Crossroads from May 2013 until November 2013.  Mr. Coleman has been a director of Ciber, Inc. (NYSE:  CBR), a leading global information technology company, since April 2014, where he also serves on the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Coleman has also served as a director of Hudson Global, Inc. ("Hudson Global"), a worldwide provider of highly specialized professional-level recruitment and related talent solutions, since May 2014, where he also serves on the Compensation Committee.

Degree from the United States Air Force Academy, an M.B.A. from Golden Gate University, and is a graduate of the United States Air Force Communications Systems Officer School.  Lone Star Value believes that Mr. Coleman's depth of experience serving in senior executive positions and on various public company boards coupled with his extensive expertise in business development and operations well qualifies him for service as a director of the Company.
Robert G. Pearse, age 55, currently serves as a Managing Partner at Yucatan Rock Ventures, a firm he co-founded in 2004, where he specializes in technology investments and consulting.  Mr. Pearse serves as a director for Aviat Networks, Inc and member of the Compensation Committee and Nominating & Governance Committee since January 2015.  Mr. Pearse serves as a director for Crossroads Systems, Inc., Chairman of the Compensation Committee, and member of the Audit Committee and Nominating & Governance Committee since 2013.  From 2005 to 2012, Mr. Pearse served as vice president of Strategy and Market Development at NetApp, Inc.

Mr. Pearse's professional experience also includes positions at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Eastman Chemical Company, and General Motors Company. Mr. Pearse earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1986, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1982.  Lone Star Value believes that Mr. Pearse's extensive leadership experience and deep understanding of the technology industry will make him a valuable addition to the Board.

("Aderans"), a multi-national company engaged in hair-related business, since August 2008, and is the Executive Chairman of Aderans America Holdings, Inc., Aderans' holding company in the United States.  Mr. Schechter has also served on the Board of Directors of The Pantry, Inc. a leading independently operated convenience store chain in the southeastern United States and one of the largest independently operated convenience store chains in the country, since March 2014, where he currently serves as a member of the Audit Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.  From 2001 to 2013, Mr. Schechter served as Managing Director of Steel Partners Ltd., a privately owned hedge fund sponsor, and its affiliates.

OLD GREENWICH, Conn., March 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lone Star Value Management, LLC (together with its affiliates, "Lone Star Value", "we" or "us"), the largest stockholder of Dakota Plains Holdings, Inc. ("Dakota Plains" or the "Company") (NYSE MKT: DAKP), with ownership of approximately 11.0% of the Company's outstanding shares, announced today that it has formally nominated five candidates for election to the Company's board of directors (the "Board") at the Company's upcoming 2016 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2016 Annual Meeting").
Lone Star Value, a stockholder of Dakota Plains since early 2014, is committed to maximizing value for ALL Dakota Plains' stockholders by upgrading and replacing the existing Board, overhauling the Company's corporate governance and compensation policies, and running a proper strategic alternatives process.
We believe the Company's poor stock price performance is a direct result of the failures of the CEO and incumbent Board.  We are confident our five nominees will dramatically improve the Board by adding a stockholder's perspective and the required expertise to improve performance.  We believe the need for an immediate upgrade to the Board is undeniable given Dakota Plains' stock price decline of 96% during Craig McKenzie's tenure as CEO[1] and its decline of 91% since the Board was partially reconstituted last year.[2]
As we have noted in prior press releases, Dakota Plains' CEO, Craig McKenzie, and Chairman, Adam Kroloff, have a long history of destroying stockholder value beyond Dakota Plains:

Canadian Superior Energy, Inc. - stock price declined over 60% while McKenzie served as CEO[3]; and 
Toreador Resources Corporation - stock price massively underperformed peer group while Mr. McKenzie served as CEO and declined more than 60% while Mr. Kroloff served as a director.[4]
Under pressure from Lone Star Value, Dakota Plains made several defensive and unilateral changes to the Board and Bylaws in February 2015.  The Board also made multiple claims and promises to stockholders that it has failed to keep in what can only be seen as a ploy to gain support prior to last year's annual meeting: 

Dakota Plains announced a strategic alternatives process in February 2015.
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
The Board has failed to show any progress in its strategic alternatives process and terminated its advisors a few months ago after incurring $1.1 million in costs in 2015.[5]  We believe the Company's original announcement was just for show and question whether a legitimate process was ever truly pursued.
In December 2014, Dakota Plains issued very precise EBITDA guidance for 2015 of $23.4 million with CEO McKenzie saying at the time "While the volumes we are providing in our 2015 guidance represent significant growth over 2014, I believe they will prove to be conservative… we don't make guidance lightly.  Those who follow the company would know, we didn't provide guidance at all last year.  And so with $23.4 million of the EBITDA guidance we're certainly seeing that is something that we can deliver for stockholders and based on ongoing discussions we're hopeful that we'll be in a position to do even better."[6]  CEO McKenzie re-affirmed this guidance a few months later stating "we are right in line with our 2015 plan…and we have no reason to believe that we're not going to be meeting our guidance, so therefore today, it is reiterated."[7]
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
In May of 2015, CEO McKenzie removed Dakota Plains' 2015 guidance citing a change in market conditions.  Either he did not understand the Company's profit drivers in December 2014 or he issued misleading guidance and reiterated this guidance in an attempt to create stockholder support ahead of the 2015 Annual Meeting. 
The Company's actual EBITDA for 2015 was $8.7 million[8], 63% below the CEO's December 2014 forecast.
The Board claimed to be acting in the best interest of its stockholders, but has unilaterally adopted numerous anti-stockholder provisions contrary to best corporate governance practices such as:
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
Amending the Bylaws to prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings until the conclusion of the 2015 Annual Meeting; 
Further amending the Bylaws prior to the conclusion of the 2015 Annual Meeting to perpetuate the suspension of such critical stockholder rights until the conclusion of the 2016 Annual Meeting; and 
Adopting a poison pill earlier in January 2016.
 											 			   		  	 		  			   																																																		
We firmly believe that each of these stockholder-unfriendly changes should have been approved by stockholders prior to their adoption in accordance with best corporate governance practices rather than being unilaterally adopted by the incumbent Board.
To us, these violations of stockholder rights and broken promises can only be explained by a desire by the incumbent Board to stay in power another year and enrich themselves at stockholders' expense.  Again, we would like to remind stockholders that the Company's stock price has declined 91% since the Board was partially reconstituted in February 2015.[9]  It is evident to us that significant changes to the Board are necessary given the Company's continued underperformance under the leadership of the incumbent Board.
We believe another major factor contributing to the destruction of stockholder value at Dakota Plains is the extravagant compensation packages given to CEO McKenzie and the members of the Board.  The compensation paid to CEO McKenzie during his first two years, for example, totaled approximately $5 million.  This amount equates to a staggering 84% of the Company's EBITDA during this period.[10]  In addition, Board members each receive compensation totaling $150,000 in cash and stock per year, which we believe is excessive given the Company's size and poor performance.
Given the significant value destruction that has persisted under the incumbent Board, Lone Star Value calls on the Board to hold the 2016 Annual Meeting without delay in order to allow stockholders to elect representatives who have their best interests in mind at this critical stage for the Company.  We further call on the Board to terminate the poison pill immediately and to refrain from taking any of the following actions prior to the 2016 Annual Meeting without prior stockholder approval:

Delaying the 2016 Annual Meeting; 
Maintaining the poison pill; 
Making any acquisitions; 
Issuing equity or equity-linked securities; or 
Adopting any corporate governance changes that serve to further entrench the Board, including classifying the Board.
Lone Star Value would like to remind each of the incumbent directors that they have a fiduciary duty to act in stockholders' best interests and any breaches thereof may have serious personal consequences that may even result in personal liability under certain circumstances. 
If elected, our independent nominees would commit to the following actions at Dakota Plains:

Implement a pay-for-performance structure for management to better align executive compensation with stockholder value creation; 
Reduce Board compensation; 
Review all expenses, especially corporate overhead, with a goal of significantly reducing all corporate costs; 
Improve corporate governance; and 
Analyze all strategic alternatives over the short, medium, and long term with a sole goal of maximizing value for stockholders.
Lone Star Value's Nominees:
Lone Star Value has nominated five highly-qualified director candidates for election to the Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting whose experience encompasses transportation, energy, investment banking, mergers & acquisitions, capital markets, and turnaround expertise.  Our nominees are Jeff Eberwein, Michael Hidalgo, Kevin Rendino, Josh Schechter, and Galen Vetter.  We believe our five nominees possess a well-balanced set of skills that will create an immediate impact and drive stockholder value at the Company.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (6.29% upside)

Lone Star Value Calls for Change at Aviat Networks




Seeks to Refresh a Stale and Entrenched Board, Improve Corporate 
      Governance, and Maximize Shareholder Value by the Election of Six 
      Candidates to Aviat’s Board






October 06, 2014 10:43 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lone Star Value Management, LLC (“Lone Star Value Management,” and, 
      together with its affiliates and director nominees, “Lone Star Value”), 
      a significant shareholder in Aviat Networks, Inc., a Delaware 
      corporation (“Aviat” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:AVNW), with ownership of 
      approximately 1.25 million shares of common stock, today announced that 
      it had given formal notice to Aviat of its intention to nominate 
      director candidates for election to the board of directors of Aviat (the 
      “Board”) at the upcoming 2014 annual meeting of Aviat shareholders (the 
      “2014 Annual Meeting”).
    

      Lone Star Value is dedicated to maximizing shareholder value, improving 
      corporate governance, and upgrading the Board at Aviat. Lone Star Value 
      notes that Aviat’s stock price has declined from $22.40 when the current 
      company was formed in January 2007 to a price of $1.78 today, a decline 
      of over 90%. Aviat’s shares have performed poorly due to very 
      disappointing financial and operating performance. From 2007 to 2014, 
      for example, Aviat generated cumulative net losses of almost $700 
      million. In fact, Aviat has reported negative earnings in all of the 
      last 8 years, dating back to its creation from the Harris-Stratex 
      Networks merger. We believe substantial change is needed at Aviat in 
      order to improve performance and this change must start by refreshing 
      and upgrading its Board. The incumbents of Aviat will no doubt ask for 
      more time to turn things around, yet it is too much to believe that the 
      same stale Board pursuing the same strategy will suddenly find success. 
      If elected by our fellow shareholders, our Board nominees will seek to 
      ensure all actions are taken to realign the business to its core markets 
      and customers in order to return Aviat to profitability. We will take 
      these actions with a sense of urgency that has not existed with the 
      current board. In addition, we will diligently evaluate all strategic 
      alternatives to create value for Aviat shareholders. These changes can 
      only occur with the addition of fresh, highly-qualified, and independent 
      directors to the Board.
    

      Lone Star Value believes the current Aviat Board, of which six of the 
      eight total members have served together as a team since the Company’s 
      creation in 2007, is in dire need of new talent and a fresh perspective. 
      We further believe that current management and Board compensation are 
      excessive given the Company’s $700 million in cumulative net losses. We 
      particularly object to Executive Chairman Kissner’s recently-signed 
      compensation package, which we believe is excessive in view of years of 
      unaddressed poor performance. In our opinion, Kissner’s new employment 
      contract as Executive Chairman is forcing Aviat’s long-suffering 
      shareholders to pay for two CEOs. Aviat should instead create 
      compensation packages with a pay-for-performance structure to 
      help turn Aviat into a profitable organization and to better align 
      incentives with shareholder value creation.
    

      Lone Star Value has expressed its views to the Board and management of 
      Aviat in person at company headquarters and in follow-up conference 
      calls. We have engaged in constructive discussions with the Company with 
      the goal of meaningfully improving Aviat’s Board, corporate governance 
      practices, and shareholder alignment. Lone Star Value believes its 
      suggestions would meaningfully improve shareholder rights and 
      representation at Aviat. Unfortunately, to date the Company has not 
      responded positively to the suggestions made by Lone Star Value and 
      offered us only one Board seat, which we believe is insufficient change 
      given Aviat’s extremely poor long-term track record.
    

      Accordingly, Lone Star Value is nominating six highly-qualified director 
      candidates for election to the Board at the 2014 Annual Meeting whose 
      experience encompasses telecom, technology, financial, and turnaround 
      expertise. Lone Star Value’s candidates are Richard K. Coleman, Jr.; 
      Dilip Singh; Robert G. Pearse; Jonathan P. Foster; Alan L. Bazaar; and 
      Jeffrey E. Eberwein, each of whom we believe has significant and 
      relevant experience as well as an exceptional track record of creating 
      shareholder value. Lone Star Value’s director nominees possess a 
      well-balanced mix of skills to ensure that the Company evaluates, with 
      an open mind and a keen sense of urgency, all strategic alternatives to 
      maximize value for all shareholders. In addition to Lone Star Value’s 
      six nominees, we intend to vote Lone Star Value Investors, LP’s (“Lone 
      Star Value Investors”) shares for CEO Michael Antonio Pangia and Board 
      member Raghavendra Rau to leverage their knowledge and backgrounds.
    

      Lone Star Value remains open to continuing its discussions with the 
      Board regarding its composition and corporate strategy and remains 
      amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to re-constitute 
      the Board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders. 
      In the event an agreement is not reached, however, Lone Star Value is 
      fully prepared to solicit the support of its fellow shareholders to 
      elect all six of its director nominees at the 2014 Annual Meeting. Our 
      nominees, if elected, will take their fiduciary responsibility very 
      seriously and will represent the interests of ALL 
      shareholders, not just Lone Star Value.
    

      Lone Star Value’s independent and highly-qualified candidates are:
    

Richard K. Coleman, Jr., age 57, who is the founder and President 
      of Rocky Mountain Venture Services. Since 1998, his company has helped 
      companies plan and launch new business ventures and restructuring 
      initiatives. As a private investor and advisor, Mr. Coleman helps 
      companies develop and execute strategic changes, often serving as an 
      interim executive and/or board member. Mr. Coleman is currently the 
      President and CEO of Crossroads Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRDS) (“Crossroads 
      Systems”), a global provider of data archive solutions, a position he 
      has held since November 2013. He currently serves on the board of 
      Crossroads Systems; Ciber, Inc. (NYSE:CBR), a leading global information 
      technology company; and Hudson Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSON) (“Hudson 
      Global”), a worldwide professional-level recruitment firm. Previously, 
      he served as a director of Aetrium Incorporated (NASDAQ:ATRM) 
      (“Aetrium”), when a manufacturer of electromechanical equipment; On 
      Track Innovations Ltd. (NASDAQ:OTIV) (“On Track Innovations”), one of 
      the pioneers of cashless payment technology; and NTS, Inc. (formerly 
      NYSE:NTS) (“NTS”), a broadband services and telecommunications company 
      until the completion of its sale in June 2014. Mr. Coleman has also 
      served in a variety of senior operational roles including CEO of Vroom 
      Technologies Inc., a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software 
      company; CEO of MetroNet Communications, Canada’s largest independent 
      facilities-based telecom services provider; and President of US West 
      Long Distance. In addition he has held significant officer level 
      positions with Frontier Communications, Centex Telemanagement and Sprint 
      Communications. Mr. Coleman began his career as an Air Force 
      Telecommunications Officer managing Department of Defense R&D projects. 
      He has served as an Adjunct Professor for Regis University’s Graduate 
      Management program and is a guest lecturer for Denver University, 
      focusing on leadership and ethics. Mr. Coleman holds a B.S. Degree from 
      the United States Air Force Academy, an M.B.A. from Golden Gate 
      University, and is a graduate of the United States Air Force 
      Communications Systems Officer School. Lone Star Value Investors 
      believes that Mr. Coleman’s depth of experience serving in senior 
      executive positions and on various public company boards coupled with 
      his extensive expertise in business development and operations well 
      qualifies him for service as a director of Aviat.
    

Dilip Singh, age 66, has served as the general partner of Value 
      Generation Capital Fund LP since December 2013. Mr. Singh also serves as 
      a director of ALCO Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALCS), which operates as a U.S. 
      regional broad line retailer, since August 2014 ; a director of On Track 
      Innovations, since December 2012; and a director of Concurrent Computer 
      Corporation (NASDAQ:CCUR), a provider of software, hardware, and 
      services for the multi-screen video and real-time simulation markets, 
      since July 2012. From April 2012 to April 2013, Mr. Singh served as the 
      interim CEO, President and as a director of InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. 
      (NYSEMKT:INFU) (“InfuSystem Holdings”), a provider of ambulatory 
      infusion pumps and associated clinical services. Under Singh INFU was 
      turnaround to sustained profitability within two quarters, cash 
      increased, debt was reduced, and a $36.5 Million credit facility was 
      secured. Previously, Mr. Singh served as CEO of MRV Communications, Inc. 
      (NASDAQ:MRVC), a provider of optical communications network 
      infrastructure equipment and network management products, from July 2010 
      to December 2011 and as a director from October 2010 to December 2011. 
      Under Singh MRVC was turned around and the first return of capital was 
      paid to the shareholders as a special dividend. From December 2008 to 
      May 2009 Mr. Singh served as the CEO of Telia-Sonera NCell, a 
      significant mobile operator in Nepal. From October 2004 to November 
      2008, Mr. Singh served as the CEO of Telenity, Inc., a provider of 
      service delivery platforms. In addition he held significant professional 
      positions at Sprint Communication and Alcatel/ITT. Mr. Singh earned a 
      Master’s of Science in Physics from the University of Jodhpur and a 
      Masters of Technology in Electronics & Communications Electrical 
      Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology. Lone Star Value 
      believes Mr. Singh is uniquely qualified to serve on the Company’s Board 
      given his vast experience on corporate boards of directors and 
      operational executive leadership positions, as well as his experience in 
      turning around under-performing companies.
    

Robert G. Pearse, age 54, currently serves as a Managing Partner 
      at Yucatan Rock Ventures, a firm he co-founded in 2004, where he 
      specializes in technology investments and consulting. Mr. Pearse serves 
      as a director of Crossroads. Mr. Pearse previously served as vice 
      president of Strategy and Market Development at NetApp, Inc. 
      (NASDAQ:NTAP) (“NetApp”), a computer storage and data management 
      company. At NetApp, Mr. Pearse played an influential role in leading 
      corporate growth and business development which drove NetApp to become a 
      Fortune 500 company. Mr. Pearse has held professional and leadership 
      positions at Hewlett-Packard, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Eastman 
      Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN), and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). Mr. 
      Pearse earned a Master of Business Administration degree from the 
      Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1986, and a Bachelor of Science 
      degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of 
      Technology in 1982. Lone Star Value believes Mr. Pearse’s extensive 
      leadership experience and deep understanding of the technology industry 
      will make him a valuable addition to the Board.
    

Jonathan P. Foster, age 50, has more than 29 years of experience, 
      which began with a Big 4 Accounting foundation, in senior financial 
      roles with small private to large corporate, public, domestic, and 
      international companies focused in various industries and encompasses 
      contributions to five turnarounds, seven successful M&A initiatives, and 
      two Greenfield start-ups. Currently he serves as CFO of InfuSystem 
      Holdings. Mr. Foster previously served as Interim Director of Finance & 
      Accounting for LSG Sky Chefs USA, Inc., a subsidiary of LSG Lufthansa 
      Service Holding AG; as President of United Credit, Inc.; and as CEO and 
      founder of Advance Today, LLC, and Furobos Reinsurance Ltd., two 
      companies focused on consumer finance. Mr. Foster also served: as CFO of 
      Syntronix, LLC, for the purpose of rolling-up three manufacturers; as 
      CFO and Executive Vice President of Drypers Corporation, a global 
      consumer products company operating in four continents; as CFO of 
      Dickson Weatherproof Nail Company, a private hardware manufacturing 
      company, and as controller and treasurer with two divisions of 
      Schlumberger Ltd.– one of which was in telecommunications. Mr. Foster 
      spent six years with Deloitte & Touche LLP with clients in many 
      different industries – textiles, manufacturing, electronic transactions, 
      insurance, professional firms, wholesale, agri-business, and others. Mr. 
      Foster is a CPA and from 2006 to 2012 served on the Board of Financial 
      Institutions for the State of South Carolina which regulates the State’s 
      $40 billion lending industry. Mr. Foster also served six years on the 
      board of the Baptist Easley Hospital Foundation. Mr. Foster earned his 
      B.S. in Accounting from Clemson University. Lone Star Value believes 
      that Mr. Foster’s over twenty years of Wall Street experience and 
      valuable public company and financial expertise, gained from his 
      employment history, will enable him to provide effective oversight of 
      the Company as a member of the Board.
    

Alan L. Bazaar, age 44, is currently the CEO of Hollow Brook 
      Wealth Management LLC (“Hollow Brook”), a position he has held since 
      November 2013, where he is responsible for firm-wide operations, 
      investment research, and portfolio management. Mr. Bazaar is currently 
      Chairman of the board of directors of Wireless Telecom Group, Inc. 
      (NYSEMKT:WTT) (“WTT”), which designs and manufactures radio frequency

      industries. Mr. Bazaar was formerly a director of NTS, and served from 
      December 2012 until the completion of its sale in June 2014. From 2004

      International, Inc. (OTC: MSII) (“Media Sciences”), which manufactured 
      and distributed business color printer supplies and industrial ink 
      applications in the United States. From July 1999 until December 2009, 
      Mr. Bazaar was a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Richard L. 
      Scott Investments, LLC where he co-managed the public equity portfolio 
      and was responsible for all elements of due diligence. Previously, Mr. 
      Bazaar served as a director of Airco Industries, Inc., a privately held 
      manufacturer of aerospace products, and was employed by Arthur Andersen 
      LLP in the Assurance and Financial Buyer's Practices group and in the

      received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bucknell University and a Master 
      of Science and Master of Business Administration from the Stern School 
      of Business at New York University. Lone Star Value believes Mr. 
      Bazaar’s successful track record as an accomplished business leader with 
      significant experience as CEO and member of public boards will make him 
      a valuable addition to the Board.
