Latest Customer Reviews




As usual, it is working wonderfully. The customer was dumbfounded on how quick the unit snaps to setpoint and holds.–A Gas Mixing Customer


I’ve had to work with Alicat staff several times, and I cannot believe how much effort your guys put into helping us out. Out of every vendor and company we’ve ever worked into in the prototyping industry, Alicat has always been a positive experience. I don’t know how your staff stays so positive knowing that they live in Arizona.–A Prototyping Customer


No complaints here, you guys did everything you said you would – when you said you would. And the unit is the star of the lab.–An Industrial Manufacturing Customer


I have been using Alicat Flow Meters, Pressure Meters and Pressure Controllers since 2006, so far I am happy with the product and the service from you guys, I feel that I am buying more than the instrument itself, I feel more like I am buying a working solution, even though this might sound cliché, is how I see Alicat, good job!!–An Appliance Manufacturing Customer


Thanks for such a quick response on this. I have to say you have exceeded my timing expectation; I have yet to receive a single call back from your competitors. We will keep you in mind for future flow projects.–An Automotive Manufacturing Customer


Just wanted to let you know I am a big fan of Alicat’s pressure and flow controllers and flow meters as well. They have solved many testing problems for me over the years. Great products you are marketing!–A Plastics Manufacturing Customer


I’ve been really happy with the flowmeter so far. I’ve used it a few times in the field to calibrate and verify flows on TEOMs and BAMs. So far, it responds quickly and has given us accurate flows. It’s particularly handy at a monitoring site I run on a rooftop, because I can read the screen from ground level. That means I can look at different flow rates without having to keep climbing up and down the ladder.–An Ambient Air Monitoring Customer


I wanted to tell you that I have had a wonderful experience with your company. Your customer service team is great, I got answers back quickly, and overall I am very satisfied. Whatever you are doing, keep doing it! You get an A++ for me!–An Electronics Manufacturing Customer


We like your fast turn on orders.–A Biotechnology Customer


Alicat mass air flow meters have proven to be accurate, so accurate that we use them to calibrate other instruments.
Another advantage over others we have used is how steady the read out is; what a difference this makes when one is trying to record values!–A Spray Painting Customer


Please thank Jesse for his help getting the custom order in place and processed for timely delivery. I can honestly say that we are very pleased with the MFCs, flow meters, and pressure controllers from Alicat that we already have on site; we have a few from other Mfrs but definitely prefer the ease of use, options available and excellent performance in the units from Alicat.
–A Bioreactor Customer


I choose Alicat because of your excellent delivery time and low cost. You also have a good reputation among users.–An HVAC Customer


I was lucky enough to get my hands on (quite literally) a Whisper in Atlanta, Ga during the NAAMC conference this year. As I was looking it over and talking with the nice folks at the booth I had a vision of myself doing a flow verification on my API calibrator in minutes and not hours. I took a flyer and presented it to my boss again and again and again. We just bought a higher flow unit so I can calibrate all the MFC’s in our calibrators and our orifices for particulate work. I’m excited!
–An Air Particulate Monitoring Customer

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



C Value | A Growth | A Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

History[edit]
The early years 1984–2000: inception, interoperability and going public[edit]
Previously named Mortice Kern Systems, MKS was founded in 1984 by four University of Waterloo students, Randall Howard, Alex White, Trevor Thompson and Steve Izma. The company, founded initially as a consulting group, delivered to market its first product, MKS Toolkit, in 1985.
In 1987, MKS stepped into the version control market with a product called MKS RCS, which was renamed to MKS Source Integrity in 1992, deciding at that time to put strategic emphasis and focus expansion on the software configuration management marketplace, a segment of what is now known as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM).
In 1997 MKS began development of an enterprise version management system that formed the underlying architecture of the MKS Integrity ALM product offered today. This initiative was further realized in 1999 when MKS invested the bulk of its R&D efforts towards re-designing MKS Source Integrity as a multi-tier Java EE platform to address the needs of large enterprise installations.
In 1998 MKS purchased the Implementer product and division of Silvon Software, based out of Chicago, Illinois, to add AS/400 support to its ALM product line. Continuing with acquisitions, in 1999 the Interoperability Business Unit merged with DataFocus Inc., a long time OEM partner, and was charged with the evolution of the MKS Toolkit and NuTCRACKER products.
In the 1999–2000 timeframe, the company also embarked on a web content management strategy with the launch of a product called Web Integrity. This precipitated a spin-off strategy, resulting in the formation of a company called Vertical Sky. This short-lived venture was not successful, and the company abandoned its content management product and regrouped and rebuilt under the MKS brand name in 2001.
2001–2008: The rise of application lifecycle management[edit]
In 2001, following the company's restructuring and refinancing, MKS shifted its primary focus to the enterprise market, expanding from its desktop-based version control and defect tracking system to the multi-tier software change and configuration management (SCM) system it had been developing technically since 1997. The new product, now known as MKS Integrity, had a Java EE foundation and was brought to market in June, 2001. Since that time, the company has expanded feature sets beyond SCM, into what is now called in the marketplace, Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), with the incorporation of requirements management and release management in 2005, and test management and portfolio management in 2006. As of 2006, the ALM revenues for the company constitute over 80% of the annual revenues (MKS Inc. (2006-06-07). "MKS Announces Record Revenue and Earnings for Fiscal 2006" (Press release). MKS Inc. Retrieved 2006-11-08. ).
In late 2005 MKS opened an office in Japan where the company began to offer local service and support for their customer base in countries such as Australia, China, Japan, Korea and Singapore.
By October 2006, the Interoperability Division of MKS announced the release of MKS X/Server - technology, SCO XVision Eclipse and the SCO Wintif, that was rebranded after being acquired from SCO.
In 2001 Philip C. Deck, join the company and was appointed CEO. Shortly after, Michael W. Harris, joined and was appointed President and COO in July 2002, and Douglas Sawatzky, formerly VP Finance, as Chief Financial Officer in February, 2006.
Throughout 2006–2008 MKS was recognized by industry analysts and PR firms as a strong contender in the ALM market and continued to receive industry accolades for its strong technical offerings:

Company Recognized by SD Times as an Innovation Leader for Fourth Straight Year[4]
In 2008 Forrester proclaims MKS as the leader in requirements management in the independent research report[5]
MKS positioned in the 'Leaders' quadrant in Gartner's first Magic Quadrant for Software Change and Configuration Management (SCCM) for Distributed Platforms[6]
MKS positioned as an influential vendor in the ALM Vendor Report by independent analyst firm, Voke Inc.[7]

In late 2007 and early 2008 the company acted upon growing success in the embedded systems market and focused its strategy both in terms of sales and development on large global organizations in the automotive, aerospace/defense, medical device and mobile device sectors.
2009–2010: Consolidation of development markets[edit]
With the current industry focus the company is seeing the advanced product development organizations, those with a combination software and hardware focus, forcing the consolidation of the traditional product development and software development life-cycles.
The accolades continued for MKS Integrity with more from the analyst and PR firms:

Gartner positioned MKS as a leader in the 2009 Magic Quadrant for Software Change and Configuration Management (SCCM) for Distributed Platform[8]
Forrester named MKS as a leader in Agile development management tools in Forrester Research Inc., May 2010.[9]

In late 2009 Michael W. Harris was appointed as the company's President and CEO while Philip C. Deck was appointed Executive Chairman and continues his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors.[10]
August 23, 2010 Charlie Janes returns to MKS and is appointed Vice President of Sales for North America.
In September, 2010, Andrew M. Wertkin was appointed Chief Technology Officer (CTO).[11]
November 3, 2010, Michelle Dickey joined MKS as Vice President Federal Sales to spearhead a team for the North American Government market.
2011: The Acquisition of MKS Inc.[edit]
On May 31, 2011, it was announced that PTC had completed the acquisition of MKS and that MKS would operate as the Integrity Business Unit of PTC going forward.[12]

History[edit]
The early years 1984–2000: inception, interoperability and going public[edit]
Previously named Mortice Kern Systems, MKS was founded in 1984 by four University of Waterloo students, Randall Howard, Alex White, Trevor Thompson and Steve Izma. The company, founded initially as a consulting group, delivered to market its first product, MKS Toolkit, in 1985.
In 1987, MKS stepped into the version control market with a product called MKS RCS, which was renamed to MKS Source Integrity in 1992, deciding at that time to put strategic emphasis and focus expansion on the software configuration management marketplace, a segment of what is now known as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM).
In 1997 MKS began development of an enterprise version management system that formed the underlying architecture of the MKS Integrity ALM product offered today. This initiative was further realized in 1999 when MKS invested the bulk of its R&D efforts towards re-designing MKS Source Integrity as a multi-tier Java EE platform to address the needs of large enterprise installations.
In 1998 MKS purchased the Implementer product and division of Silvon Software, based out of Chicago, Illinois, to add AS/400 support to its ALM product line. Continuing with acquisitions, in 1999 the Interoperability Business Unit merged with DataFocus Inc., a long time OEM partner, and was charged with the evolution of the MKS Toolkit and NuTCRACKER products.
In the 1999–2000 timeframe, the company also embarked on a web content management strategy with the launch of a product called Web Integrity. This precipitated a spin-off strategy, resulting in the formation of a company called Vertical Sky. This short-lived venture was not successful, and the company abandoned its content management product and regrouped and rebuilt under the MKS brand name in 2001.
2001–2008: The rise of application lifecycle management[edit]
In 2001, following the company's restructuring and refinancing, MKS shifted its primary focus to the enterprise market, expanding from its desktop-based version control and defect tracking system to the multi-tier software change and configuration management (SCM) system it had been developing technically since 1997. The new product, now known as MKS Integrity, had a Java EE foundation and was brought to market in June, 2001. Since that time, the company has expanded feature sets beyond SCM, into what is now called in the marketplace, Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), with the incorporation of requirements management and release management in 2005, and test management and portfolio management in 2006. As of 2006, the ALM revenues for the company constitute over 80% of the annual revenues (MKS Inc. (2006-06-07). "MKS Announces Record Revenue and Earnings for Fiscal 2006" (Press release). MKS Inc. Retrieved 2006-11-08. ).
In late 2005 MKS opened an office in Japan where the company began to offer local service and support for their customer base in countries such as Australia, China, Japan, Korea and Singapore.
By October 2006, the Interoperability Division of MKS announced the release of MKS X/Server - technology, SCO XVision Eclipse and the SCO Wintif, that was rebranded after being acquired from SCO.
In 2001 Philip C. Deck, join the company and was appointed CEO. Shortly after, Michael W. Harris, joined and was appointed President and COO in July 2002, and Douglas Sawatzky, formerly VP Finance, as Chief Financial Officer in February, 2006.
Throughout 2006–2008 MKS was recognized by industry analysts and PR firms as a strong contender in the ALM market and continued to receive industry accolades for its strong technical offerings:

Company Recognized by SD Times as an Innovation Leader for Fourth Straight Year[4]
In 2008 Forrester proclaims MKS as the leader in requirements management in the independent research report[5]
MKS positioned in the 'Leaders' quadrant in Gartner's first Magic Quadrant for Software Change and Configuration Management (SCCM) for Distributed Platforms[6]
MKS positioned as an influential vendor in the ALM Vendor Report by independent analyst firm, Voke Inc.[7]

In late 2007 and early 2008 the company acted upon growing success in the embedded systems market and focused its strategy both in terms of sales and development on large global organizations in the automotive, aerospace/defense, medical device and mobile device sectors.
2009–2010: Consolidation of development markets[edit]
With the current industry focus the company is seeing the advanced product development organizations, those with a combination software and hardware focus, forcing the consolidation of the traditional product development and software development life-cycles.
The accolades continued for MKS Integrity with more from the analyst and PR firms:

Gartner positioned MKS as a leader in the 2009 Magic Quadrant for Software Change and Configuration Management (SCCM) for Distributed Platform[8]
Forrester named MKS as a leader in Agile development management tools in Forrester Research Inc., May 2010.[9]

In late 2009 Michael W. Harris was appointed as the company's President and CEO while Philip C. Deck was appointed Executive Chairman and continues his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors.[10]
August 23, 2010 Charlie Janes returns to MKS and is appointed Vice President of Sales for North America.
In September, 2010, Andrew M. Wertkin was appointed Chief Technology Officer (CTO).[11]
November 3, 2010, Michelle Dickey joined MKS as Vice President Federal Sales to spearhead a team for the North American Government market.
2011: The Acquisition of MKS Inc.[edit]
On May 31, 2011, it was announced that PTC had completed the acquisition of MKS and that MKS would operate as the Integrity Business Unit of PTC going forward.[12]

Latest Customer Reviews




As usual, it is working wonderfully. The customer was dumbfounded on how quick the unit snaps to setpoint and holds.–A Gas Mixing Customer


I’ve had to work with Alicat staff several times, and I cannot believe how much effort your guys put into helping us out. Out of every vendor and company we’ve ever worked into in the prototyping industry, Alicat has always been a positive experience. I don’t know how your staff stays so positive knowing that they live in Arizona.–A Prototyping Customer


No complaints here, you guys did everything you said you would – when you said you would. And the unit is the star of the lab.–An Industrial Manufacturing Customer


I have been using Alicat Flow Meters, Pressure Meters and Pressure Controllers since 2006, so far I am happy with the product and the service from you guys, I feel that I am buying more than the instrument itself, I feel more like I am buying a working solution, even though this might sound cliché, is how I see Alicat, good job!!–An Appliance Manufacturing Customer


Thanks for such a quick response on this. I have to say you have exceeded my timing expectation; I have yet to receive a single call back from your competitors. We will keep you in mind for future flow projects.–An Automotive Manufacturing Customer


Just wanted to let you know I am a big fan of Alicat’s pressure and flow controllers and flow meters as well. They have solved many testing problems for me over the years. Great products you are marketing!–A Plastics Manufacturing Customer


I’ve been really happy with the flowmeter so far. I’ve used it a few times in the field to calibrate and verify flows on TEOMs and BAMs. So far, it responds quickly and has given us accurate flows. It’s particularly handy at a monitoring site I run on a rooftop, because I can read the screen from ground level. That means I can look at different flow rates without having to keep climbing up and down the ladder.–An Ambient Air Monitoring Customer


I wanted to tell you that I have had a wonderful experience with your company. Your customer service team is great, I got answers back quickly, and overall I am very satisfied. Whatever you are doing, keep doing it! You get an A++ for me!–An Electronics Manufacturing Customer


We like your fast turn on orders.–A Biotechnology Customer


Alicat mass air flow meters have proven to be accurate, so accurate that we use them to calibrate other instruments.
Another advantage over others we have used is how steady the read out is; what a difference this makes when one is trying to record values!–A Spray Painting Customer


Please thank Jesse for his help getting the custom order in place and processed for timely delivery. I can honestly say that we are very pleased with the MFCs, flow meters, and pressure controllers from Alicat that we already have on site; we have a few from other Mfrs but definitely prefer the ease of use, options available and excellent performance in the units from Alicat.
–A Bioreactor Customer


I choose Alicat because of your excellent delivery time and low cost. You also have a good reputation among users.–An HVAC Customer


I was lucky enough to get my hands on (quite literally) a Whisper in Atlanta, Ga during the NAAMC conference this year. As I was looking it over and talking with the nice folks at the booth I had a vision of myself doing a flow verification on my API calibrator in minutes and not hours. I took a flyer and presented it to my boss again and again and again. We just bought a higher flow unit so I can calibrate all the MFC’s in our calibrators and our orifices for particulate work. I’m excited!
