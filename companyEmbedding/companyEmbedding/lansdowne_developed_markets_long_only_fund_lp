Lansdowne Launches Long-Only Fund For Flagship Managers
Oct 3 2012  |  1:38pm ET

Lansdowne Partners has added a long-only fund to the portfolio of its top hedge-fund managers, Peter Davies and Stuart Roden.
The London-based hedge fund launched its Developed Markets Long-Only Fund on Monday, Financial News reports. The new fund will invest only in the largest and most-liquid stocks.
Davies and Roden have been running the strategy since January as a managed account, with US$350 million from an American institutional investor. The managers believe the new fund will profit over the next decade, which Davies and Roden say will see material flows over that period.
Developed Markets Long-Only is actually Davies' and Roden's second long-only offering, after the Developed Markets Strategic Investment Fund, which debuted five years ago. That fund, which currently manages US$580 million, has a US$1 billion capacity.
The new fund has an unlimited capacity, unlike Developed Markets Strategic Investment and their newly-renamed and restructured Developed Markets hedge fund. That fund has a US$7.6 billion capacity due to short-book constraints. That fund is up 8.75% on the year.
Developed Markets Long-Only will charge a 1% management fee and no performance fee.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.
