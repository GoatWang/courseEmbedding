Thomas J. Tierney - Wikipedia





















 






Thomas J. Tierney

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Thomas J. "Tom" Tierney (born 5 March 1954, California) is an American business executive and corporate writer, who is the co-founder of the nonprofit Bridgespan Group. He has been chairman of eBay since July 2015. Tierney is cited by the book Management Consultancy in the 21st Century as a specialist in customer service and marketing.[1]
Background[edit]
Tierney graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School, and studied for a BA in Economics, at the University of California, Davis, where he received the highest distinction. He joined Bain & Company in 1980,[1] and served as the Managing Director of its San Francisco office from 1987 to 1992. In June 1992 he was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Bain & Company, a post which he held until January 2000, during which time the company grew significantly, venturing into business internationally and generating revenues six times what they had been.[2]
Later career[edit]
In 1998, Tierney co-founded The Bridgespan Group, described by Bloomberg as an "independent, nonprofit affiliate of Bain & Company designed to provide general management consulting services to foundations and nonprofit organizations". He launched the organization in 1999, and was appointed its chairman. In March 2003, Tierney was appointed an Independent Director at eBay, and he has been its Lead Independent Director since April 2012.[2]
Aside from his Bridgespan and eBay position, Tierney has been the Director of The Nature Conservancy, Director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and has held numerous other posts on nonprofit boards, including the Hoover Institution, The United Way of the Bay Area, The Committee for Economic Development and the WGBH Educational Foundation. He has also served administratively with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.[1] Tierney is still associated with Harvard Business School, where he was appointed chair of the Harvard Business School Social Enterprise Initiative Advisory Board in January 2009.[3] He occasionally lectures at the school and has contributed numerous business articles in The Harvard Business Review and books, including Forbes's Learning From The Chief Executive Officer and Aligning the Stars (2002), which he co-authored with Jay W. Lorsch, which documents business strategy and organization.[2][4][5] In 2011 he co-authored Give Smart: Philanthropy That Gets Results with Joel L. Fleishman.[6] Tierney said of Give Smart: Philanthropy That Gets Results: "The basic premise behind the book is that there must be ideas relevant to philanthropy that have been proven over time, ideas that were as useful to Andrew Carnegie as they are to Bill Gates. One of the reasons [co-author] Joel [Fleishman] and I teamed up was that he has done extensive research on twentieth-century philanthropy, a lot of which he used in The Foundation ".[7]

In 1999, he co-founded The Bridgespan Group, an independent, nonprofit organization designed to provide professional services to philanthropists, foundations and other nonprofits. During 2000, he stepped down as Bain & Company's chief executive to concentrate on Bridgespan-related activities. Tom frequently speaks and writes on a variety of topics related to nonprofit leadership and philanthropy. He lectures at Harvard Business School and the Stanford Graduate School of Business and chairs the Harvard Business School Social Enterprise Initiative. He has contributed to numerous case studies and publications, including The Harvard Business Review and the Stanford Social Innovation Review. He also has been featured in articles on philanthropy in the New York Times and the Financial Times. He has been profiled in various publications, including Learning from the CEO and Finishing Well. He also co-authored a popular book about organization and strategy titled, "Aligning the Stars," published in April 2002 by Harvard Business School Press. In 2009, Tom was named as one of the Nonprofit Times Power and Influence Top 50. He co-authored with Joel L. Fleishman Give Smart: Philanthropy That Gets Results, which was published in March 2011.  In 2012, Tom led the production on "Conversations with Remarkable Givers," a groundbreaking, free video series, housed on Bridgespan.org, of candid conversations with a range of extraordinary philanthropic decision makers.  Tom joined Bain & Company in 1980 following graduation from Harvard Business School, where he received his MBA with distinction. He was promoted to partner after three years and from 1987 to 1992 served as the managing director of Bain's San Francisco office. In 1992, he became Bain's chief executive. During the 1990s, under his leadership, Bain & Company grew its revenues six-fold, while significantly expanding its international operations.ExperienceChairman and Co-FounderThe Bridgespan Group2000  –  Present (17 years)The Bridgespan Group is a nonprofit advisor and resource for mission-driven organizations and philanthropists.

Yet despite tremendous innovation in the social sector, philanthropy's natural state is under-performance. Not since Andrew Carnegie wrote The Gospel of Wealth has a book been written that provides practical guidance for donors to get the most impact from their giving.Almost a decade ago, Thomas J. Tierney left Bain & Company to co-found The Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit focused on helping donors and nonprofit leaders to develop and execute strategies to accelerate social change. In Give Smart, Tierney pools his hands-on knowledge with philanthropy expert Joel L. Fleishman to create a much-needed primer for philanthropists and the nonprofit organizations they support. Drawing from personal experiences, testimonials, and Bridgespan's case studies, including those of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Give Smart picks up where Jim Collins' Good to Great and the Social Sectors left off and presents the first in-depth, expert guide for engaged donors and nonprofit leaders.Authors: Thomas J. Tierney, Joel L. FleishmanAligning the Stars: How to Succeed When Professionals Drive ResultsHarvard Business Review PressApril 2002Focusing on the sector of professional service firms (including ad agencies, law firms, executive search firms, tech service providers, strategy consultants and more), Harvard Business School professor Lorsch and consultant Tierney explain how to manage talent for success. The authors examine 18 organizations, from Goldman Sachs to Ogilvy & Mather, to show readers how "alignment" (organizing a firm's talent) results from leadership and its implementation. Professional service firms are a major component of business today, making the market for Lorsch and Tierney's book a substantial one. Their suggestions are timely and specific.Authors: Thomas J. Tierney, Jay W. LorschHigh Stakes Donor CollaborationsStanford Social Innovation ReviewMarch 2013Pioneering groups of foundations and philanthropists have pooled their talent and resources to help solve social sector problems too big for any one to tackle alone. What can donors learn from these efforts?Authors: Thomas J. Tierney, Willa Seldon, Gihani FernandoTom Tierney, Chairman & Co-founder, The Bridgespan Group & Co-author, Give Smart: Philanthropy That Gets ResultsPhilanthropyNYUAuthors: Thomas J. Tierney, Ann Paisley ChandlerThe Donor Grantee Trap: How ineffective collaboration undermines philanthropic results for society, and what can be done about it. A guide for nonprofit leaders, their boards, and their donors.The Bridgespan GroupOctober 2011Scarce resources (both money and time) are routinely wasted in the critical linkage between donor and grantee. As a consequence, our communities—the causes and constituents we are trying to serve—are being unnecessarily shortchanged.What’s needed is more effective donor-grantee collaboration, so that philanthropists and the nonprofit organizations they support can get the absolute most from every scarce dollar they invest.  Reduced to the essentials, there are three imperatives of true collaboration—for which both donors and grantees must share responsibility. They are: Resource it Right: Make sure that the grantee has what it takes to get the job done.Pursue Partnership: Develop shared goals and a productive working relationship (which demands a certain level of strategic clarity and a reasonable “cost-of-capital” burden on the grantee).Get Better Together: Create the necessary conditions for learning and continuous improvement. These imperatives appear simple; experience has shown, however, that following them almost always requires confronting—and overcoming—some deeply ingrained dynamics, assumptions, and behaviors.The Donor-Grantee Trap details each imperative in turn. It is written for nonprofit executives, their boards, and their major donors. Based upon and excerpted from the book Give Smart: Philanthropy That Gets Results, by Thomas J. Tierney and Joel L. Fleishman, it is also supplemented with content from several related Bridgespan articles, which reflect The Bridgespan Group’s extensive field experience working with both donors and their grantees.Authors: Thomas J. Tierney, Richard SteeleCollaborating for The Common GoodHarvard Business Review MagazineJuly 2012Collaboration among competitors is an unnatural act—but sometimes it’s the best way to reduce costs, leverage strength, accelerate scale, or amplify influence in order to generate results. Useful lessons lie in how collaboration among unlikely allies is achieving change in the world of social enterprise.Authors: Thomas J.

Tierney, Joel FleishmanDelivering on the Promise of NonprofitsHarvard Business ReviewNovember 2008Ending violence in inner-city communities, educating disadvantaged children, stemming the loss of rain forests or marine wildlife—U.S. nonprofits are being asked to take on an increasing share of society’s most important and difficult work. At the same time, the expectations being placed on these organizations to show results—by their staff members, their boards, and public and private donors—are rising. How are nonprofits responding? By being much more explicit about the results they intend to deliver and the strategies and organizations they’ll create to achieve those outcomes.Authors: Thomas J. Tierney, Jeff Bradach, Nan StoneThe Leadership DeficitStanford Social Innovation ReviewJune 2006One of the biggest challenges facing nonprofits today is their dearth of strong leaders—a problem that is only going to get worse as the sector expands and baby boom executives retire. Over the next decade nonprofits will need to find some 640,000 new executives, nearly two and a half times the number currently employed. To meet the growing demand for talent, the author offers creative ways of finding and recruiting new leaders from a wide range of groups, including business, the military, and the growing pool of retirees.Authors: Thomas J.

Biography[edit]
Tierney was born in Galway's Mainguard Street, the son of John Tierney of Hollymount, County Mayo, and Ellen Kinnevey of Roscahill, County Galway. He had siblings Jack and Mary. The family ran a grocery. After the early death of his father, the business was sold and Ellen re-joined her first profession, nursing.
Tierney began working for Córas Imopair Éireann (CIÉ) shortly after leaving school, and was to become a prominent member of the Irish Transport & General Workers Union, been variously branch secretary and vice-President. His work in trade unionism brought him into politics; in 1960 he was elected to Galway Corporation, and became Mayor as an Independent Labour candidate, the first of the kind in Galway. He made industrial unrest and unemployment his priority, and was proud of the fact that while he was Mayor, no industrial action was taken in the city. This was avoided because Tierney made himself constantly available for negotiations between management and unions.
He made history in 1968 when he became the first Mayor from Ireland to wear his robes of office in Stormont Castle while meeting the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence O'Neill. Among the items discussed were tourism, and the unsettling political situation. In March 1968 he was guest of honor of Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago during the Saint Patrick's Day parade. On this trip he addressed the United States House of Representatives, and in Boston visited American soldiers wounded in Vietnam. One of the latter was a Lieutenant David Tierney, who told Mayor Tierney his grandparents were from Galway.
Tierney spent nineteen years on the Corporation, fifteen on the Harbour Board as Commissioner, and a number of other private and public associations. He married Margaret (Peggy) Lydon in 1945, and their children were Harriet, John, Francis, Evelyn, Thomas, Margaret, Della, Stephanie, Michael. He is buried in New Cemetery, Bohermore.
