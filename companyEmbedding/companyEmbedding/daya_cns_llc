Leadership


Steven J. Hanley, MBA – Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder
Mr. Hanley is an experienced global business leader who has managed highly complex pharmaceutical and medical device operations with annual global revenue exceeding $1 billion. As the President of Covidien’s Imaging Solutions business unit, he led a multifunctional organization that included sales, marketing, logistics, manufacturing, as well as research and development.
Internationally, his track record includes numerous new drug and device product introductions and sales force expansion in Eastern Europe, China, and Latin America. Mr. Hanley is experienced working in different cultures and successfully navigating dynamic regulatory environments.
Over his nearly 18 years with the Covidien family of companies, Mr. Hanley developed a large network of business leaders and clinicians to help determine market needs, commercial potential, and product positioning. As a sales leader, he called on radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, cardiologists, as well as surgeons in specialties including general, orthopedic, and OB/GYN.
Mr. Hanley was Principal and Founder of Neem LLC. Neem was founded in 2009 to focus on startup and entrepreneurial medical device and other life science companies with whom the firm works to bridge the gap between breakthrough technology and commercialization. Mr. Hanley is the Chairman of the Board of Managers for Daya CNS LLC based in St Louis Missouri as well as the Board of Directors of Check-Cap(Nasdaq, Chek), based in Israel.
Mr. Hanley has his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business administration from Marquette University.



Richard B. Dorshow, PhD – Chief Scientific Officer, President, and Co-Founder
Dr. Dorshow is an experienced research physicist and manager with over 30 years in R&D with a focus on developing innovative, business-oriented research programs. He established and led the optical diagnostics and therapeutics program at Mallinckrodt, constructed its Intellectual Property (“IP”) position, and is co-inventor on almost all the related IP. Establishment and subsequent development of this program yielded a robust product pipeline. In the process, valuable relationships with external clinicians were developed, validating the program and providing access to key thought leaders and collaborators.
Subsequent to a corporate strategy redirection, Dr. Dorshow had the unique opportunity to acquire the biophotonics technology, which he had built, led, and developed. Thus, MediBeacon was founded with the patent estate, market research, equipment, and other related assets from Mallinckrodt.
Dr. Dorshow completed his Ph.D. work on the characterization of surfactant systems employing light scattering. This produced some of the first results demonstrating critical behavior in multi-component complex fluid systems. After this, he moved immediately into the industry. At British Petroleum, Dr. Dorshow pioneered the development of a noninvasive optical detection technique for the measurement of oil & gas interfacial properties, needed for estimation of the amount of oil extractable from a reservoir.
Dr. Dorshow is currently a member of the American Physical Society, the Optical Society of America, the Society of Molecular Imaging, the Colloid Division of the American Chemical Society, and the International Society for Optics and Photonics known as SPIE. He is a program committee member and session chair for the International Symposium on Biomedical Optics. Dr. Dorshow has authored or co-authored over 70 scientific publications and is an inventor on over 60 issued U.S. patents.
Dr. Dorshow has his bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.



Terence H. Stern, MBA – Vice President Business Development
Mr. Stern is a multi-lingual, global executive with a broad record of entrepreneurial achievement across the healthcare arena. In 2010 Mr. Stern partnered with Mr. Hanley at Neem LLC where he developed detailed investment theses and financial models for clients in collaboration with leading healthcare-focused private equity firms.
In 2012 upon the inception of MediBeacon Mr. Stern joined Dr. Dorshow and Mr. Hanley as Vice President Business Development for the Company. Mr. Stern has operational and transactional experience spanning startups to large corporate entities.
As CEO and Founder of Vetbrands International, he led the private equity-backed management buyout of Ralston Purina’s pharmaceutical business. Cargill owned assets were acquired and combined with an independently owned pharmaceutical / R&D facility in Brazil. The successful orchestration of multiple acquisitions and the subsequent merger, integration, and growth led to the sale of this top ten Brazilian animal pharmaceutical business to Ceva Santé Animale (global animal health company with revenues of approximately $1 billion).
Mr. Stern has held various general management and corporate development roles including work at Novus International where under his direction Novus’s leading global nutrition specialty business profitably doubled sales through organic growth. His leadership resulted in approval of significant incremental investments including a dedicated production facility and bolt-on acquisition. In 2010, Mr. Stern led negotiation of a joint venture resulting in the acquisition of the first human supplement ingredient for Novus International.
Mr. Stern is fluent in French, Portuguese, and Spanish. He has his bachelor’s degree from Colgate University and a master’s degree in business administration from Washington University in St. Louis.
