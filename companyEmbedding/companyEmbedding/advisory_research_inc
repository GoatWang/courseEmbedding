yield spread
The variation between yields on different types of debt securities; generally a function of supply and demand, differences in maturities, or credit quality. Treasury bonds, for example, because they are perceived to be safe, will normally yield less than corporate bonds of the same maturity. Corporate bonds, then, are said to trade at a “spread” above Treasury rates.

Advisory Research, Inc. Adds Cupps Capital Management Investment Team | Business Wire


























































Advisory Research, Inc. Adds Cupps Capital Management Investment Team






August 18, 2016 05:07 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Advisory 
      Research, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Piper 
      Jaffray Companies (NYSE: PJC), today announced that the investment 
      team of Cupps Capital Management (“Cupps”), a Chicago-based asset 
      management business, will be joining Advisory Research. The combination 
      will bring the Cupps team’s growth stock investing expertise and 
      strategies to Advisory Research’s multi-manager platform which will 
      provide a full range of distribution and product support services. 
      Advisory Research’s existing investment teams and strategies will remain 
      unchanged.
    


      As part of Advisory Research and consistent with its current structure, 
      the Cupps team will focus solely on the proven U.S. growth investment 
      process developed by Drew Cupps over 20 years ago. The Cupps team is 
      expected to complete their transition to Advisory Research at the 
      beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016.
    

      “As a fellow Chicago-based asset manager, we have known Cupps for many 
      years and always admired their commitment to excellence, the integrity 
      of their investment process and their dedication to their clients,” said 
      Chris Crawshaw, CEO of Advisory Research. “We are excited to welcome 
      them to the Advisory Research family and further expand Piper Jaffray’s 
      commitment to the investment management business.”
    

      “Advisory Research’s broader distribution capabilities, strong business 
      team and comprehensive resources position us for many years of success, 
      and most importantly, offer our team unprecedented levels of focus on
