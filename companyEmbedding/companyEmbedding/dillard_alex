History[edit]
Dillard's is the outgrowth of a department store founded in 1938 by William T. Dillard; its corporate headquarters remain located at the eastern edge of Little Rock's Riverdale area, and many of its executives and directors are members of the Dillard family. The family still controls the company through its ownership of Class B Common Stock; the Class A common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[5]

Beginnings[edit]
Dillard sold the original five and dime store in Nashville, Arkansas, to develop a department store in Texarkana, Arkansas, initially as the minority partner in Wooten & Dillard. In 1956, Dillard led an investment group that acquired the Mayer & Schmidt store in Tyler, Texas. This store eventually took on the name "Dillard's Mayer & Schmidt" until 1974, when it was replaced with a mall-based location south of downtown Tyler.
In 1960, Dillard acquired and turned around the failing Brown-Duncan store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The success of this turnaround was followed in late 1963 by acquiring the Joseph Pfeifer store in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in early 1964 acquiring the other main store in Little Rock, Gus Blass Co. Dillard used this as an opportunity to relocate his headquarters to Little Rock. In 1969, Dillard and his investors took Dillard Department Stores, Inc., public on the American Stock Exchange.
Thereafter, the chain expanded rapidly as an anchor in suburban shopping malls, and took advantage of market conditions to acquire smaller chains as well as its ability to turn around locations that other companies could not operate profitably.
Acquisitions and expansion[edit]
Expansion of the Dillard's chain increased rapidly during the 1970s, mainly through expanding into new malls being built in smaller cities in Texas. In 1971 five Texas units were acquired from Fedway, a division of Federated Department Stores (the stores were rebadged as Dillard's in 1972). In 1974 five Leonard's stores were acquired in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as a commitment to open a new downtown Fort Worth store at the Tandy Center (site of the original Leonard's). Also in 1974, the former Brown-Dunkin, Blass, Pfeifer and Mayer & Schmidt stores were fully renamed Dillard's.

The 1980s brought the purchase of many local chains. In 1982, Dillard's leased three units of the defunct Lowenstein's chain in Memphis, Tennessee. In early 1984, Dillard’s acquired 12 Stix, Baer & Fuller stores in St. Louis and Kansas City from Associated Dry Goods Corp., while in fall 1984 two department store divisions were purchased from Dayton-Hudson Corporation: Diamond's and John A. Brown, with locations in Arizona, Nevada and Oklahoma. Twelve stores in Kansas and Missouri belonging to R. H. Macy & Co.'s Midwest Division, which was later dissolved in 2006, were acquired in early 1986, while the three-unit Hemphill-Wells company in West Texas was purchased in the summer. The stores at Sunset Mall in San Angelo and South Plains Mall in Lubbock were both converted, while the third in downtown Lubbock was closed.[6]

In 1987, Dillard's purchased 26 of Joske's 27 stores in Texas and Arizona as well as the four unit Cain-Sloan chain in Nashville, Tennessee, from Allied Stores Corp. This deal gave Dillard's two major anchor locations at several malls in Texas and Arizona with many of the second locations being converted to a separate, expanded home and men's stores, a format that Dillard's utilized greatly, both to grow its store size cost effectively and to prevent competitors from gaining valuable real estate. Additionally the Joske's acquisition gave Dillard's entry into the Houston market.
Dillard's in 1988 acquired the former Selber Bros. clothing department store chain, founded in 1907 in Shreveport, Louisiana, which also had a few locations in Texas.[7]
In 1988, Dillard's purchased the three-unit Miller & Paine chain in Lincoln, Nebraska, as well as more significantly, a half-interest and operational control of The Higbee Co., based in Cleveland, Ohio, with partner Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd., of New Orleans, was purchased in 1989, bringing 18 units primarily in Louisiana, as well two former Diamond's units in Tucson, Arizona.
1990s acquisitions[edit]
The Ivey's chain of 23 stores in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina was acquired from BATUS in 1990. This was followed by the acquisition of eight Florida Gulf Coast stores from Maison Blanche Co. in 1991 (which had acquired them as Robinsons of Florida only a few years before). In 1992, the remaining interest in the Higbee's stores were acquired, as well as five Ohio stores from Horne's (as part of a legal settlement, Dillard's having canceled a 1988 deal to acquire the chain). Also in 1992, three stores from the Hess's chain liquidation (five other former Hess's were acquired in 1994), two E.M. Scarbrough's locations in Austin, Texas, two former Thalhimer's in South Carolina and Tennessee, a former Lord & Taylor store in Memphis, Tennessee and three former Belk-Lindsey stores in Florida were acquired by Dillard's. Except for two Belk of Columbia stores acquired in 1995, acquisitions were eschewed for several years until in early 1997 ten buildings in Florida were acquired from Mervyns, seven southern Virginia stores were purchased from Proffitt's (which had acquired them from Hess's in 1993), and the three suburban Macy's stores in Houston were absorbed.
Late 1990s[edit]
The deal-making culminated with the purchase of Mercantile Stores Co., Inc., in 1998. The purchase of this Fairfield, Ohio-based department store company brought several chains, including Bacon's, Castner Knott, de Lendrecie's, Gayfers, Glass Block, Hennessy's, J.B. White, Joslins, Lion Store, Maison Blanche, McAlpin's, Root's and The Jones Store. Dillard's sold 26 stores of the former Mercantile Stores to May Department Stores Co. and Saks Incorporated and traded an additional seven stores to Belk for nine of theirs in southern Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Overall this deal enabled Dillard's to enhance its position in several markets in the South, Midwest and Mountain states.
Also in 1998, the chain entered California, opening its first store in a former Weinstock's at Weberstown Mall in Stockton, California.[8] In 1999 Dillard's opened a store at Mall of Georgia near Atlanta, Georgia.
Recent events[edit]




Dillard’s in Fairview, Texas opened on March 10, 2010.


After the acquisition of Mercantile, Dillard's ceased expanding through acquisitions, although eight locations of the defunct Montgomery Ward in the Midwest, and four locations from ZCMI in Utah and Idaho were acquired in 2001.
In 2004, Dillard's store credit card operation, operated as Dillard's National Bank, was sold to GE Money Bank. Customers can now be issued Dillard's/American Express cards as well the traditional Dillard's store charge. These cards can be used at any store that accepts the American Express brand.
In 2005 Dillard's opened a store at Atlantic Station in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2008, Dillard's closed their travel agency, Dillard's Travel, alongside all in-store locations due to economic conditions. Dillard's Travel previously operated in 43 of the 318 stores.[9][10]
Current operations[edit]

Map of Dillard's locations


The chain continues to expand and has recently added stores in non-traditional mall shopping centers. Currently, the largest Dillard's store at 365,000 square feet (33,000 m²) is located at Scottsdale Fashion Square, an enclosed super-regional mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. Within the Dallas area, the chain has two flagship stores with a 299,000-square-foot (27,800 m2) store at the Northpark Center in Dallas and a 310,000-square-foot (29,000 m2) store at the North East Mall in Hurst.[11] Its flagship store in the East Coast region, at 260,000 square feet (24,000 m2), is located in the MacArthur Center in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. The home store for the chain is in Little Rock; the divided store is located in the trend-conscious Park Plaza Mall, one of the city's oldest continuously operating shopping centers in its midtown section.
In several "upper-scale" locations - like Simon Malls-owned Midland Park Mall, Texas, or in locations where another acquired store existed before the merger, Dillards operates both Men's and Women's stores; both are located within the same mall but in separate, distinct "anchor" (locations). Dillard's also maintains separate Men's and Women's anchor stores at Cielo Vista Mall and Sunland Park Mall, both in El Paso, Texas; the Mall of Abilene in Abilene, Tx; the Battlefield Mall in Springfield, Missouri; Melbourne Square Mall in Melbourne, Florida; Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; First Colony Mall in Sugar Land, Texas (suburban Houston); South Plains Mall in Lubbock, TX; Westgate Mall in Amarillo, TX; Golden Triangle Mall in Denton, TX; Central Mall in Fort Smith, Arkansas; Lakeline Mall in Cedar Park, Texas (suburban Austin); Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio, (suburban Cleveland); Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, Kansas (suburban Kansas City); Towne West Square in Wichita, Kansas; Sikes Senter Mall in Wichita Falls, TX; Penn Square Mall in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Northpark Mall in Ridgeland, Mississippi; and the Frontier Mall in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The two Great Lakes Mall stores, however, have since consolidated into one, with the other, located around the corner from the Macy's, sitting empty with signs redirecting customers to the consolidated store.
At Volusia Mall in Daytona Beach, Florida, Dillard's operates three separate two-story buildings: Dillard's East, a men's/home store; Dillard's South, a children's/juniors store; and Dillard's West, a women's store.[12]

History[edit]
Dillard's is the outgrowth of a department store founded in 1938 by William T. Dillard; its corporate headquarters remain located at the eastern edge of Little Rock's Riverdale area, and many of its executives and directors are members of the Dillard family. The family still controls the company through its ownership of Class B Common Stock; the Class A common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[5]

Beginnings[edit]
Dillard sold the original five and dime store in Nashville, Arkansas, to develop a department store in Texarkana, Arkansas, initially as the minority partner in Wooten & Dillard. In 1956, Dillard led an investment group that acquired the Mayer & Schmidt store in Tyler, Texas. This store eventually took on the name "Dillard's Mayer & Schmidt" until 1974, when it was replaced with a mall-based location south of downtown Tyler.
In 1960, Dillard acquired and turned around the failing Brown-Duncan store in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The success of this turnaround was followed in late 1963 by acquiring the Joseph Pfeifer store in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in early 1964 acquiring the other main store in Little Rock, Gus Blass Co. Dillard used this as an opportunity to relocate his headquarters to Little Rock. In 1969, Dillard and his investors took Dillard Department Stores, Inc., public on the American Stock Exchange.
Thereafter, the chain expanded rapidly as an anchor in suburban shopping malls, and took advantage of market conditions to acquire smaller chains as well as its ability to turn around locations that other companies could not operate profitably.
Acquisitions and expansion[edit]
Expansion of the Dillard's chain increased rapidly during the 1970s, mainly through expanding into new malls being built in smaller cities in Texas. In 1971 five Texas units were acquired from Fedway, a division of Federated Department Stores (the stores were rebadged as Dillard's in 1972). In 1974 five Leonard's stores were acquired in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as a commitment to open a new downtown Fort Worth store at the Tandy Center (site of the original Leonard's). Also in 1974, the former Brown-Dunkin, Blass, Pfeifer and Mayer & Schmidt stores were fully renamed Dillard's.

The 1980s brought the purchase of many local chains. In 1982, Dillard's leased three units of the defunct Lowenstein's chain in Memphis, Tennessee. In early 1984, Dillard’s acquired 12 Stix, Baer & Fuller stores in St. Louis and Kansas City from Associated Dry Goods Corp., while in fall 1984 two department store divisions were purchased from Dayton-Hudson Corporation: Diamond's and John A.

Macy & Co.'s Midwest Division, which was later dissolved in 2006, were acquired in early 1986, while the three-unit Hemphill-Wells company in West Texas was purchased in the summer. The stores at Sunset Mall in San Angelo and South Plains Mall in Lubbock were both converted, while the third in downtown Lubbock was closed.[6]

In 1987, Dillard's purchased 26 of Joske's 27 stores in Texas and Arizona as well as the four unit Cain-Sloan chain in Nashville, Tennessee, from Allied Stores Corp. This deal gave Dillard's two major anchor locations at several malls in Texas and Arizona with many of the second locations being converted to a separate, expanded home and men's stores, a format that Dillard's utilized greatly, both to grow its store size cost effectively and to prevent competitors from gaining valuable real estate. Additionally the Joske's acquisition gave Dillard's entry into the Houston market.
Dillard's in 1988 acquired the former Selber Bros. clothing department store chain, founded in 1907 in Shreveport, Louisiana, which also had a few locations in Texas.[7]
In 1988, Dillard's purchased the three-unit Miller & Paine chain in Lincoln, Nebraska, as well as more significantly, a half-interest and operational control of The Higbee Co., based in Cleveland, Ohio, with partner Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd., of New Orleans, was purchased in 1989, bringing 18 units primarily in Louisiana, as well two former Diamond's units in Tucson, Arizona.
1990s acquisitions[edit]
The Ivey's chain of 23 stores in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina was acquired from BATUS in 1990. This was followed by the acquisition of eight Florida Gulf Coast stores from Maison Blanche Co. in 1991 (which had acquired them as Robinsons of Florida only a few years before). In 1992, the remaining interest in the Higbee's stores were acquired, as well as five Ohio stores from Horne's (as part of a legal settlement, Dillard's having canceled a 1988 deal to acquire the chain). Also in 1992, three stores from the Hess's chain liquidation (five other former Hess's were acquired in 1994), two E.M. Scarbrough's locations in Austin, Texas, two former Thalhimer's in South Carolina and Tennessee, a former Lord & Taylor store in Memphis, Tennessee and three former Belk-Lindsey stores in Florida were acquired by Dillard's. Except for two Belk of Columbia stores acquired in 1995, acquisitions were eschewed for several years until in early 1997 ten buildings in Florida were acquired from Mervyns, seven southern Virginia stores were purchased from Proffitt's (which had acquired them from Hess's in 1993), and the three suburban Macy's stores in Houston were absorbed.
Late 1990s[edit]
The deal-making culminated with the purchase of Mercantile Stores Co., Inc., in 1998. The purchase of this Fairfield, Ohio-based department store company brought several chains, including Bacon's, Castner Knott, de Lendrecie's, Gayfers, Glass Block, Hennessy's, J.B. White, Joslins, Lion Store, Maison Blanche, McAlpin's, Root's and The Jones Store. Dillard's sold 26 stores of the former Mercantile Stores to May Department Stores Co. and Saks Incorporated and traded an additional seven stores to Belk for nine of theirs in southern Virginia and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Overall this deal enabled Dillard's to enhance its position in several markets in the South, Midwest and Mountain states.
Also in 1998, the chain entered California, opening its first store in a former Weinstock's at Weberstown Mall in Stockton, California.[8] In 1999 Dillard's opened a store at Mall of Georgia near Atlanta, Georgia.
Recent events[edit]




Dillard’s in Fairview, Texas opened on March 10, 2010.


After the acquisition of Mercantile, Dillard's ceased expanding through acquisitions, although eight locations of the defunct Montgomery Ward in the Midwest, and four locations from ZCMI in Utah and Idaho were acquired in 2001.
In 2004, Dillard's store credit card operation, operated as Dillard's National Bank, was sold to GE Money Bank. Customers can now be issued Dillard's/American Express cards as well the traditional Dillard's store charge. These cards can be used at any store that accepts the American Express brand.
In 2005 Dillard's opened a store at Atlantic Station in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2008, Dillard's closed their travel agency, Dillard's Travel, alongside all in-store locations due to economic conditions. Dillard's Travel previously operated in 43 of the 318 stores.[9][10]

Map of Dillard's locations


The chain continues to expand and has recently added stores in non-traditional mall shopping centers. Currently, the largest Dillard's store at 365,000 square feet (33,000 m²) is located at Scottsdale Fashion Square, an enclosed super-regional mall in Scottsdale, Arizona. Within the Dallas area, the chain has two flagship stores with a 299,000-square-foot (27,800 m2) store at the Northpark Center in Dallas and a 310,000-square-foot (29,000 m2) store at the North East Mall in Hurst.[11] Its flagship store in the East Coast region, at 260,000 square feet (24,000 m2), is located in the MacArthur Center in downtown Norfolk, Virginia. The home store for the chain is in Little Rock; the divided store is located in the trend-conscious Park Plaza Mall, one of the city's oldest continuously operating shopping centers in its midtown section.
In several "upper-scale" locations - like Simon Malls-owned Midland Park Mall, Texas, or in locations where another acquired store existed before the merger, Dillards operates both Men's and Women's stores; both are located within the same mall but in separate, distinct "anchor" (locations). Dillard's also maintains separate Men's and Women's anchor stores at Cielo Vista Mall and Sunland Park Mall, both in El Paso, Texas; the Mall of Abilene in Abilene, Tx; the Battlefield Mall in Springfield, Missouri; Melbourne Square Mall in Melbourne, Florida; Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; First Colony Mall in Sugar Land, Texas (suburban Houston); South Plains Mall in Lubbock, TX; Westgate Mall in Amarillo, TX; Golden Triangle Mall in Denton, TX; Central Mall in Fort Smith, Arkansas; Lakeline Mall in Cedar Park, Texas (suburban Austin); Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, Ohio, (suburban Cleveland); Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, Kansas (suburban Kansas City); Towne West Square in Wichita, Kansas; Sikes Senter Mall in Wichita Falls, TX; Penn Square Mall in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Northpark Mall in Ridgeland, Mississippi; and the Frontier Mall in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The two Great Lakes Mall stores, however, have since consolidated into one, with the other, located around the corner from the Macy's, sitting empty with signs redirecting customers to the consolidated store.
At Volusia Mall in Daytona Beach, Florida, Dillard's operates three separate two-story buildings: Dillard's East, a men's/home store; Dillard's South, a children's/juniors store; and Dillard's West, a women's store.[12]

About DILLARD'S INC.


   Tradition is trying to catch up with the times at Dillard's. Sandwiched between retail giant Macy's and discount chains such as Kohl's, Dillard's is rethinking its strategy and trimming its store count. The department store chain operates about 290 locations (down from 330 in 2005) in some 30 US states, covering the Sunbelt and the central US. Its stores cater to middle- and upper-middle-income women, selling name-brand and private-label merchandise with a focus on apparel and home furnishings.  Founded in 1938 by William Dillard, family members, through the W. D. Company, control the company.
  
Operations
Dillard's' largest product category is ladies' apparel, at over 20% of sales, followed by men's apparel and accessories (17%), ladies' accessories and lingerie (16%), shoes (16%), and cosmetics (14%). Children's apparel, home and furniture, and construction bring in the remainder.

   Dillard's exclusive brand lines include Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree & York, and Daniel Cremieux.
  

   Beyond department stores, Dillard's owns CDI Contractors, a Little Rock, Arkansas-based construction firm that was started to build and remodel Dillard's' stores.
Geographic Reach

   Texas and Florida are the Arkansas-based department store chain's two largest markets, accounting for about a third of total stores. The company operates 293 Dillard's stores and 25 clearing centers -- representing more than 50 million sq. ft. of space -- in 29 states.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Dillard's sells its products in shopping malls, open-air centers, and online.
Financial Performance

   Dillard's sales and profits have remained mostly flat over the past few years with its rising comparable store sales offset by its shrinking net store count.
However, in fiscal 2017 (ended January), sales fell 5% to $6.3 billion due to persistent mall traffic declines.
Net income fell $100 million to $169.2 million as the retailer scrambled to cut prices in an effort to prop up store traffic.
Cash flow from operations increased 15% to $517 million due to a sharp increase in trade accounts payable.  
Strategy

   To try and reverse falling sales, the department store chain has moved "up market", positioning itself above Macy's and Belk and below high-end chains such as Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's. To attract more customers, Dillard's is focusing on adding more fashion, much like J. C. Penney has done in recent years. The firm's new direction is inspired on the success of specialty stores with their edited displays or merchandise in boutique-like settings rather than an endless sea of apparel racks. New stores are smaller (averaging 170,000 sq. ft.) and located in open-air lifestyle centers rather than enclosed malls. Dillard's, which has been averse to marking down merchandise but has been forced to discount by its lower-end competitors, hopes its move up market will stop the markdowns.
The shift in product alignment might help stave off the onslaught on the internet as when buying high-value items customers are less willing to "get it wrong" -- much more likely when shopping online.
