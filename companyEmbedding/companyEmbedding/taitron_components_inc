Taitron Components
Incorporated 
  







TAITRON, 
                  "Discrete Components Superstore", differentiates itself 
                  from other electronic component distributors in the following 
                  ways:



TAITRON keeps prices competitive as a result of its strategic 
                    volume purchasing of a wide variety of discrete components 
                    direct from name brand manufacturers, and by its efficient 
                    low overhead operations.


TAITRON is a master distributor for many of its suppliers, 
                    selling over 44.1% of its sales to other electronic distributors, 
                    many that are in Electronic Buyers News' top 50 largest electronics 
                    distributors. 


TAITRON focuses its business exclusively on the distribution 
                    of Discrete Semiconductors, Optoelectronic Devices and Passive 
                    Components.


TAITRON distributes only electronic components with low 
                    average selling price (ASP). In 2000, TAITRON's per unit ASP 
                    was approximately 1.8 cents. 


TAITRON's large and diversified inventory provides customers 
                    one-stop shopping for their just-in-time inventory needs.
