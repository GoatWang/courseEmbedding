Overview

Value Proposition




Portfolio




Key Contacts




Our flagship funds pursue opportunistic majority or shared-control investments in businesses with strong franchises and attractive growth opportunities in North America and Europe. Our Partners average 20 years of experience investing in, advising, underwriting and restructuring leveraged companies.
 
We seek investments in companies with strong existing management teams where our capital can unlock value by serving as a catalyst for growth. We are not operating sponsors that demand day-to-day involvement in the business. Instead, we add value to our management partnerships by:

Capitalizing the company for growth at entry
Utilizing our network to enhance resources available to fully exploit a company’s potential
Leveraging our experience in capital markets activities
Implementing best practices
Assisting with strategic value-add initiatives, such as acquisitions

 
While traditional private equity funds that principally focus on control buyouts may be restricted by charter or a lack of creativity or experience, we pursue a range of creative transaction types (prudently leveraged control buyouts, growth equity, rescue/de-leveraging capital and distressed buyouts/discounted debt accumulation) in an effort to maximize the risk/reward profile of our invested capital. This flexible capital approach, together with the broad resources of the Ares Management platform, widens our universe of potential investment opportunities beyond that of many other buyout firms and allows us not only to remain active in different markets, but to be highly selective in making investments across various market environments.
 
We manage five flagship funds focused primarily on North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe: Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund, L.P. (2003); Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund II, L.P. (2006); Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund III, L.P. (2008); Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund IV, L.P. (2012); and Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund V, L.P. (2016).
