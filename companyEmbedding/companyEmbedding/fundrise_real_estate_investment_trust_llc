History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller. They began working on the project in 2010 and launched before the passing of the JOBS Act which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States.[3] Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. The brothers began the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building.[2] Fundrise's first project, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.[2][4]
After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

Fundrise Review 2017 – Invest in Commercial Real Estate Passively










Review of: Fundrise
Reviewed by: Ruth Lyons

Editor Rating

Invest online in commercial real estate via eREITs and eFunds. Gain access to real estate deals without the high dollar commitment typically needed, without being an accredited investor and without paying the high front-end load fees. However, publicly traded real estate investments might be a better option.
 


Commercial real estate investing can be an excellent way to grow your nest egg, although it’s not without risks. The big risk? Commercial real estate requires large amounts of upfront capital to purchase a property. In order to properly diversify your portfolio, you should own multiple properties, various types of properties (e.g., apartment complexes, strip malls, office space, etc.) and properties in multiple locations.
One avenue for the small investor who wishes to invest in commercial real estate is through a REIT (real estate investment trust). As you may know, a REIT owns and manages income-producing real estate.
By pooling the funds of many individual investors, the REIT can purchase a diversified mix of commercial properties — such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels and apartments — that the typical investor might not otherwise be able to purchase individually.
One type of REIT, an exchange-traded REIT, is available through any broker; as the name implies, its shares trade on the securities markets. Exchange-traded REITs have a few downsides, however. For one thing, their performance is heavily correlated with the broader stock market.

Goal Based Investing (New) – Via the Fundrise 2.0 platform, invest in real estate based upon your goals rather than types of investment or location.
eREIT – A non-traded REIT that invests in multiple commercial real estate. Compared to traditional REITs cuts out the middleman saving you on commissions.
eFund – A private fund that invests in multiple commercial real estate properites, that unlike Fundrise’s eREITs focus on growth than income.


Start Real Estate Investing With as Little as $1,000

What are eREITs?
An eREIT (short for electronic Real Estate Investment Trust) is an invention by Fundrise to make investing in commercial real estate. eREITs are similar to investing in an ETF or mutual fund. Fundrise’s eREITs are most similar to non-traded REITs. The primary difference is in the fees. When you invest in an eREIT, you don’t go through a broker — you buy directly from Fundrise. That allows Fundrise to dramatically reduce the fees. There’s no middleman, so there are no upfront fees or commissions. And rather than paying a front-end load of 7%–15%, Fundrise charges just a 1.0% annual asset management fee.
Non-traded REITs and eREITs are registered investments, and while they’re subject to the same SEC requirements that an exchange-traded REIT must meet, they’re not directly correlated with stock market fluctuations. Two downsides: There isn’t the same liquidity since they’re not traded on the markets, and front-end fees are higher than exchange-traded REITs.

The minimum investment is just $1,000 for Fundrise eREITs, and you don’t have to be an accredited investor to participate. Shares of the eREITs are purchased exclusively online, and Fundrise members receive notifications when new assets are added to the eREITs.

What is an eFund?
An eFund (short for Electronic Fund) invests in commercial real estate and is exclusive to Fundrise. It similar in design to a professionally managed mutual fund, but like the eREITs not publicly traded. eFunds are set up as partnerships and not corporations so they are taxed differently — saving on double taxation. Also, like eREITs Fundrise offers these eFunds to investors without any brokers or commissions. Unlike an eREIT which is typically used for income, Fundrise’s eFunds are set up for growth.

The Fundrise eREITs invest in many properties to diversify and smooth out investment returns.



Fundrise currently offers 3 eREIT funds to choose from Supplemental Income, Balance Investing, and Long-Term Growth.



Each eREIT breaks down the risk of each property and the amount the REIT has invested in.



Unsure which fund to invest in? Fundrise helps with a "robo-advisor like" questionnaire.








Goal Based Investing (New)
Fundrise currently offers three investment styles:



Goal
Objective




Supplemental Income
Income


Balanced Investing
Income & Growth


Long Term Growth
Growth



Your investments with Fundrise will consist of their eREITs and eFunds. The allocation will depend upon if you are looking for growth, income or a combination of both.
If you are unsure which one is right for you, Fundrise offers a three-step questionnaire that can help determine how you should invest.
For the launch of their eREITs, Fundrise offers an “accountability policy” that’s far from industry standard:

As an investor in their Income eREIT, you pay $0 in asset management fees unless you earn at least 15% annualized return during the first two years of operation, until Dec. 31, 2017.
For their Growth eREIT, Fundrise will pay a penalty of up to $500,000 to investors if it earns less than a 20% non-compounded annual return.

Fundrise is not a newcomer to real estate investing, and their team has experience in many areas of the real estate marketplace. In 2015, they had $525 million in real estate assets under management and provided an average annual return of 13% net to their investors.

 Pros
Low Minimum — The minimum investment to start with Fundrise is $1,000.
Low Fees — Fundrise charges only a 0.85% asset management fee per year.
No Accreditation — Unlike competing firms, Fundrise is open to any investor in the United States, regardless of income or net worth.
Diversification — Unlike other private REITs, Fundrise eREITs have a pool of many properties that could smooth out returns.
90-Day Guarantee — Unheard of in the investment industry, if at any time during your first 90 days as an investor you’re not satisfied, Fundrise will buy your investment back at the original investment amount. This offer is subject to certain limitations.
Commercial Real Estate Access — Commercial real estate is typically a high-dollar investment, whereas Fundrise allows you to invest with little money.
Passive Investment — Unlike owning your own commercial real estate outright, Fundrise investments are truly passive.
Quarterly Redemptions and Distributions — The Fundrise eREIT has adopted a quarterly redemption plan to provide periodic liquidity; however, distributions are not guaranteed.



 Cons

Investment Liquidity — Fundrise eREITs are not publicly traded. Once you make an investment, you are pretty much committed to the investment for the term. There is currently no secondary market to sell your investment to others; however, there is a quarterly redemption program whereby investors may be able to redeem their shares, subject to some limitations.
Tax Consequences — Distributions are taxed as ordinary income, as opposed to the 15% tax rate on qualified dividends.



Start Real Estate Investing With as Little as $1,000

Summary
Real estate as an asset class is a long-term investment. This includes REITs, whether they’re publicly traded, non-traded or eREITs. The opportunities for capital appreciation, portfolio diversification and regular distributions are alluring; however, distributions are never guaranteed.
While not exactly the same as investing in real estate directly, REITs are much more passive and allow you to invest in properties outside your geographic location. Fundrise can be a way to diversify into real estate without the large amounts of capital or management headaches involved when doing it yourself.
While I am a real estate investor, REITs have never appealed to me for several reasons — primarily because of the front-end load and ongoing fees. Fundrise takes the sting out of those investing fees with their 0.85% asset management fee.
And their unique accountability guarantee is a breath of fresh air in the investment marketplace. Every investor I know would fully agree with this statement on their website: “Today’s model of investors paying large fees to investment managers regardless of their performance makes no sense.”

Emily24 days 6 hours agoWhy does no one ever review Groundfloor?  I am tired of these reviews of “accredited investor” sites. Heck why would anyone with that kind of money invest with the internet?  I am an investor with Groundfloor and I am waiting to see how my investments do though I don’t see any real problems yet.  Groundfloor offers the ability to put in any amount of money. $10 if you want.. substantially reducing risk.  They will also give you a bonus if you do have 50K lying around and want to invest with them. They also just launched IRAs from your investments with them.  Finally, I find the website easy to use.   The only drawback is that it isn’t open to all states but if your state allows it… it is a great site. I only wish more would be started up this way.  Roofstock seems to be a site for the flat up insane. Buy real estate without ever seeing it? Insane! I have to assume that the backers of Roofstock are powerful otherwise it would b laughed out of the room.  I would like to find a real estate crowdfunding site that allows me to invest in rental property but not own it.  Similar to the flipper model of Patch of Land / Groundfloor. I give you money to get an investment property and you pay me back a certain amount per month on the loan.

1  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧Emily23 days 6 hours agoOk thanks. I would be interested in knowing about non accredited investor sites.  I would also be interested in knowing if there is any movement to change in the SEC rules.
0  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧Justin1 month 10 days agoJust want to put this out there, but I have been using Fundrise for over almost 2 years now and have gotten a consistent 10% approximate return from their INCOME REIT. I was very skeptical at first, but now considering dumping more in.  I purchased some of their IPO, and I’m re-investing my dividends working on growing my account. They are also just about to launch something called “EFUNDS” which will focus on selling shares in funds dedicated to building and remodeling single family housing in urban locations. To be honest, like anyone I am trying to be cautious, looking for any sign or negativity, scouring the web for “reviews” and comments from other users, could this be some kind of nutty web based ponzi scheme, but the SEC is all over this company it seems and they dont make any moves without their strict approval. Every move they make requires clearance and I constantly get updates on new projects they have added…..the assets are there, they are real, and they are very diversified. I would love to hear more about the experience other users have had….but right now, this is the most solid and predictable investment I own.
3  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧Tex2 months 13 days agoI fail to understand this review.  It seems that the author had two cons against it with one being liquidity and then mentions that quarterly redemptions are possible, so I’d take that to be neither a pro or con.  I could understand this being a newer investment platform that hasn’t been time tested more than a liquidity argument like the one above.
1  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧Ralphpal2 months 21 days agoI have 3000 dollars in 1 fund
And 2000 dollars in another
Since this is the first full year I been in it
Last quarter  I made about 120 dollars
For that quarter
So I will  write on this website about the next quarter  but it seems like its on track and this is after the rate hikes
So far so good
2  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧john5 months 3 days agoSo what are the real fees associated with Fundrise?  It says 1% asset management fee per year but on the website it says:
What are the costs and fees associated with investing?
Assuming a fully subscribed offering, each eREIT™ anticipates having a reimbursement of organizational expenses of approximately 2%, marketing and distribution expenses of each offering up to 1%, and annual ongoing asset management fees and operational expenses of approximately 1-1.5%.
Sounds like its more than 1%
1  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧Larry Ludwig5 months 3 days agoFrom my understanding the price varies from the eREIT offered. Let me contact Fundrise to answer this question.
0  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧B6 months 15 days agoThis is a REIT, with lower upfront fees.  All REITs are crowd investing, that is how they are funded- by a group of investors.  REITs were created specifically for this purpose.  This is the same thing as all the other REITs out there, minus a broker soliciting it.  Same Illiquidity, same risks.  Most REITs have a low entry purchase amount, usually about $1,500-2,500.   This is a Regulation A offering- read up on that (different reporting standards).  From the offering documents… “Investing in our common shares is speculative and involves substantial risks. You should purchase these securities only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment”.  This is a “blind pool” offering because we have not identified any investments to acquire with the net proceeds of this offering. You will not be able to evaluate our investments prior to purchasing shares.”  NAV is updated quarterly.  Please, please, please read the offering documents very carefully.  This is a  long term investment, so spend some time reading it because you will be locked up for a while.  It will be worth the time spent.  Especially read up on your ability to liquidate shares and the amounts these funds can liquidate.   These are serious investments, which are complex and speculative.
5  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧nicolas7 months 26 days agoI invested $1000 in June 2016, just to see how it goes, and I got my first quarterly dividend in October….of $15.56
19  |     Reply   Hide Replies ∧Frank Schoens8 months 25 days agoREITs that trade on an exchange do not have a sales load or up front fee.  They are also liquid unlike eREITs.  Further “the market” determines their value.  Who values the share price of the eREIT?  Is it the eREIT themselves?  Or is it an independent nationally know auditor?

After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller.

Strategy


The Income eREIT focuses primarily on making debt investments in commercial real estate assets that generate steady cash flow. To date, the Income eREIT has executed on this strategy by identifying institutional quality assets of sub-institutional size, particularly in urban metro markets.The Income eREIT has followed three core principles in selecting potential assets:* Small Assets: We believe targeting assets that fall under the radar of big banks and investment funds allows us to achieve higher relative returns.* Regulatory Inefficiencies: Increased banking regulations as a result of the 2008 financial crisis have opened up new opportunities for more flexible lenders to expand into the market.* Urban Infill Location: Generally real estate assets located in the core of large cities benefit from higher demand, and higher pricing, due to the relative lack of supply.For more information on the Income eREIT's strategy and operations, please see our in-depth Performance Analysis Report.

Fundrise Portfolio
“Fundrise Portfolio” is the hypothetical projected return of a portfolio of commercial real estate, based the weighted average projected annual return of (a) the Fundrise Growth eREIT, for Rise Companies Corp. sponsored appreciation-focused investment products (such as joint-venture equity), based on the analysis included in the the Growth eREIT Performance Analysis, and (b) the Fundrise Income eREIT, for Rise Companies Corp. sponsored income-focused investment products (such as senior loans), based on (i) the analysis included in the Income eREIT Performance Analysis, (ii) discounted by approximately 20 – 30% to take into account potential default risks over the long-term. Accordingly, the projected annual returns under such methodology is approximately 11.95% and 8.00% for Rise sponsored appreciation focused investments and income focused investments, respectively, inclusive of appreciation and dividend reinvestment, and net of fees.
Traditional Portfolio
“Traditional Portfolio” is the hypothetical projected return of a portfolio of public equities (stocks), based on the California Public Employees Retirement System’s average annual return on public equities over the 20-year period from 1996 to 2016, which was 8.20%, inclusive of appreciation and dividend reinvestment, and net of fees.

We’re on a mission to make quality real estate investments available to everyone.












The Fundrise Story

Historically, real estate has proven to be one of the best-performing investments. As real estate investors ourselves, we spent our early careers building and owning unique properties in Washington, DC.
Yet, too often the profits from those projects ended up mostly in the pockets of our institutional investment partners, who in reality were acting merely as middlemen standing between us and the actual people whose money was being invested.
So, we started Fundrise with a simple idea: give everyone the opportunity to invest directly in high quality real estate, without the middlemen. Our idea definitely had its skeptics. Industry professionals told us that it was impossible. Well, they were wrong.
After nearly a year of working with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we launched our first online offering, ending up with 175 individual investors. Then we did it again and again. Today, there are more than 80,000 members of Fundrise and we’ve invested in nearly $3 billion worth of real estate.
The idea is simple yet powerful. It’s caught on because it’s a good investment strategy. Fundrise offers the first low-fee diversified real estate investment available directly to anyone online. We make the process of investing in the highest quality commercial real estate from around the country simple, efficient, and transparent.
Welcome to the future of investing.

To offer Fundrise investors this tax-advantaged option, Millennium assesses a competitive annual $75 fee per Fundrise eDirect Investment.Click here to get started!










What is the minimum investment?



$1,000.










What is a goal?



Our goal based investment approach allows you to select from one of three primary goals based on your own personal preferences. Based on the goal you choose, we then build a custom-tailored portfolio designed to produce the best results for you over time. If you’re not sure what goal is right for you, we can help you decide through a simple questionnaire in which you can provide us more information about yourself.










How is my investment allocated based on the goal I choose?



Investors can choose to maximize income, long-term growth, or balanced diversification through selecting a goal. Our technology enabled management service will then allocate new funds across available investments in a way to help you best meet your goal. 










How do you keep my personal information secure?



Fundrise uses bank-level security for investor’s protection. Investor information is encrypted with an AES bit symmetric key, the same as level as the largest commercial banks. Each investor’s connection to Fundrise is always encrypted over HTTPS with Transport Layer Security (TLS). Fundrise applications and data are physically located in multiple secure data centers. We utilize Amazon Web Services for our hosting which is compliant with numerous security certifications.










Why do you need my Social Security number and date of birth?



Investments sold through the Fundrise platform are real investments. All income must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we are required to obtain your social security number and date of birth.






Investor Basics








What am I investing in?



Investors on Fundrise are allocated across a diversified mix of our eDirect offerings—eREITs and eFunds—which are portfolios of private real estate assets located throughout the United States. Your allocation across our eDirect offerings is based on your tailored investment goal. To see more detail on your investments, please visit your account page.










What are the fees?



The eDirect funds (eREITs and eFunds) pay a 0.85% annual asset management fee. In addition, clients of the investment services and management system pay a 0.15% annual investment advisory fee, although this may be waived in certain circumstances. To see a comparison of how our fees compare to traditional investment fees, click here.
 For a full description of other fees that each investment may incur, please see the offering circulars available at fundrise.com/oc.










What is the Fundrise rating?



The Fundrise Rating quantifies the relative risk of each asset in an investor’s portfolio. An investor can find the risk ratings of the assets in their portfolio in the “Your Account” section of their dashboard.
The Fundrise Rating uses a letter rating system ranging from A to E that provides investors with the ability to easily compare different assets across their portfolio. The Fundrise Rating system is meant to be objective and is driven by factual information about the investment—for example, whether an investment is “ground­ up development” or “stabilized,” or what the total leverage is on the asset. Fundrise Ratings are for informational purposes only.
Each rating is impersonal and not individualized for any specific investor’s financial situation and is not investment advice. These ratings are not intended to be, nor should you interpret them to be, a prediction of how a particular investment will actually perform. Each investor should always carefully consider investments in any security and be comfortable with his/her understanding of the investment. An investor may also consider consulting an investment professional. The full Fundrise Rating matrix can be found here along with explanations of each rating.










What documents will I receive as an investor?



After an investment has closed, investors can track its performance in their portfolio. Within the portfolio, investors will find all the relevant deal documents, as well as receive updates, distributions, and tax documents.
 As long as you are an investor, we will send you a Form 1099 or a Form K-1, as appropriate, by approximately mid-March of the following tax year.










When can I expect a return on my investment and how will it be distributed?



While the amount and timing of an investor’s return will vary depending on the goal and investments owned, generally speaking Fundrise investments are meant to be long-term and illiquid in nature. The return is primarily paid out in two ways (i) via quarterly distributions and (ii) via appreciation in asset value at the end of the asset’s investment term. While most investors can expect to receive a quarterly distribution, distributions may be more or less frequent depending on an investor’s overall portfolio allocation, market conditions, and other factors. All distributions will be deposited into your primary bank account on file unless you opt into our Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP). However, actual results may be different for each investor and there can be no guarantee of enhanced returns due to investing on Fundrise or the use of Fundrise Advisors’ services or recommendations.










How will I be updated on the progress of my investments?



The Fundrise platform provides direct communication with investors, including ongoing reporting and updates on the status of your investment, as well as the delivery of tax filing and other relevant materials.










Can I redeem my shares?



Each eDirect investment has adopted a quarterly redemption plan to provide periodic liquidity, subject to certain limitations. For more information, please see the disclosure contained in the Offering Circulars.










Can I reinvest my dividends?



Yes, The Fundrise Dividend Reinvestment Program “DRIP” allows you to automatically reinvest the dividends you earn from your investments directly back into open offerings on the platform according to your goal. For more information about the program, please refer to the full DRIP documentation.










Are there any fees associated with DRIP?



No. At this time, there are no fees associated with participating in the Fundrise Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP). For additional information, please refer to the full DRIP documentation.










Where are my dividends reinvested?



Your dividends are reinvested into open offerings on the platform according to your current goal. Investors can change their dividend reinvestment plan election in their settings here.










How can I change my dividend reinvestment preferences?



You may opt into or out of the Fundrise Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP) at any time by logging into your account settings here.
 In the “Investment Accounts” tab, click on the name of the account. Once you have clicked into the account, scroll down to the “Dividend Reinvestment” section, click “Edit”, and make your selection. However, please note that you must do so prior to the end of the quarter in order for your selection to be applied to that quarter’s dividends.
 
 In addition, please note that if you wish to opt into DRIP for an entity or joint account, you will need to make a separate manual selection by clicking on the name of that account.










Can I opt out of dividend reinvestment at any time?



Yes. You may opt out of DRIP or adjust your DRIP preferences at any time. However, please note that you must do so prior to the end of the quarter in order for your selection to be applied to that quarter’s dividends.






Investment Offerings








What is an eREIT?



An eREIT (short for electronic Real Estate Investment Trust) is a type of online alternative investment available exclusively through Fundrise. An eREIT is a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of commercial real estate assets, such as apartments, hotels, shopping centers, and office buildings from across the country. Similar to an ETF or mutual fund but specifically for commercial real estate, an eREIT allows an investor to diversify across many properties at a relatively low cost and with minimal effort. Fundrise eREITs are offered directly to investors via the Fundrise website, without any brokers or selling commissions.
 Unlike other REITs, the Fundrise eREITs offer more transparency and roughly 90% lower fees. As they are non-traded, they generally have less liquidity than REITs that are publicly traded. They also have lower correlation to the broader market, and may therefore offer greater protection from market volatility.










What is an eFund?



An eFund (short for electronic Fund) is a type of online alternative investment available exclusively through Fundrise. An eFund is a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of residential real estate assets, such as single-family detached homes, townhomes, and condominiums tailored to first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. Unlike publicly traded residential home builders, eFunds are structured as partnerships, not corporations, and therefore are not subject to the same double taxation. Fundrise eFunds are offered directly to investors via the Fundrise website, without any brokers or selling commissions.











How do I earn returns on my investment?



You can earn money through interest payments, property income, as well as potential appreciation in value of the properties themselves. As a shareholder, you are entitled to your pro-rata portion of any income earned and distributed. You may receive periodic distributions as certain underlying properties are sold. However, actual results may be different for each investor and there can be no guarantee of enhanced returns due to investing on Fundrise or the use of Fundrise Advisors’s services or recommendations.










What is the term? When can I expect to get my money back?



Fundrise investments are intended to be long-­term investments and are inherently illiquid in nature. Each eREIT and eFund plans to look for opportunities to provide liquidity to its investors after approximately five years of operations. While each eREIT and eFund expects to seek a liquidity transaction in this time frame, there can be no assurance that a suitable transaction will be available or that market conditions for a transaction will be favorable during that time frame.










What tax documents can I expect to receive?



Most investors will receive both a 1099-DIV and K-1, depending on their goal. Investors in each eREIT will receive a 1099-DIV at the end of each year. Investors in an eFund will receive a K-1, K-1 information, or substitute K-1, which will reflect their annual share of the eFund’s taxable income or losses. We intend to upload these various tax documents to the “Documents” tab of each investor’s dashboard in advance of each tax season.










What is NAV?



The Net Asset Value (NAV) per share represents the estimated value of a single share based on a variety of factors including potential changes in the underlying value of real estate assets owned. After an initial ramp-up period for each offering, NAV is typically adjusted on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. While NAV may be used to determine the Redemption Price of a share, it is only an estimate of value and the actual market price that someone would pay for such a share may vary widely. It is not uncommon for investors to see a decline in NAV during the first few quarters of operations (the “ramp-up” period) as a result of standard up front organizational costs as well as costs related to acquiring assets. Much like closing costs incurred during the purchase of a new home, these are generally not commonly recurring expenses, and are therefore unlikely to impact the long-term value of your shares.










How often will my investment change in value?



We intend to make adjustments to the Net Asset Value per share, or NAV, on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Please note that all NAV adjustments will be reflected on your investor dashboard.










Are Fundrise investments audited?



Yes. Financial statement audits occur annually and will be disclosed to investors as part of the annual report on Form 1-K, which is required to be publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after the year’s end. 






Tax Form 1099-DIV








What is a Form 1099-DIV?



IRS Form 1099-DIV is sent to investors annually and provides the tax character of any distributions (dividends and any other distributions) paid to you during the tax year.










Why have I received a Form 1099-DIV?



You received a Form 1099-DIV because you received distributions from one or more of your investments in an eREIT. To enable you to properly report these distributions to the IRS, the Form 1099-DIV shows the tax character of the distributions you received. The eREIT who sent you a distribution is identified in the box in the top-left of the form.










What is the account number?



Your Form 1099-DIV may show an account or other unique, identifying number that we have assigned to you to distinguish your account from other investors in our internal records.










What is the recipient’s identification number?



For your protection, the Form 1099-DIV we send to you may only show the last four digits of your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) or adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN). However, we are required to report your complete identification number to the IRS and, where applicable, to state and/or local governments.










What is the difference between the distributions shown in Boxes 1a, 2a, and 3?



Your Form 1099-DIV shows your ordinary dividends in Box 1a, capital gains distributions in Box 2a and non-dividend distributions in box 3.
Each year, we are required to report to you the tax character of distributions paid to you, which is determined by comparing the amount of distributions paid by the eREIT with the eREIT’s earnings and profits for a given year. The eREIT’s calculated current and accumulated earnings and profits is the result of a tax calculation, which often differs from the eREIT’s profits calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and presented to you in such eREIT’s Annual Report on Form 1-K each year. 
 In the event that any portion of distributions paid to you exceeds earnings and profits in a given year for the eREIT, it is treated as a non-dividend distribution, also referred to as a return of capital. Distributions that do not exceed the calculated current and accumulated earnings and profits are reflected as either an ordinary dividend or a capital gain distribution depending on the eREIT’s disposition activity related to real estate properties during the year. In general, ordinary and capital gain distributions are taxed currently; non-dividend distributions, or returns of capital, reduce cost basis or the original purchase value of your shares. In the event returns of capital received exceed your original cost basis, then the excess is recognized as a capital gain for the year in which it is received. Therefore, you should generally adjust the cost basis of your investment each year based on the amount shown in Box 3 “non-dividend distributions” on your Form 1099-DIV. By tracking adjustments to your cost basis each year, you will be able to properly report any gain or loss you experience on the disposition or redemption of your shares. 
 When you sell your shares, the difference between your adjusted cost basis and final net sale price will be taxable as a capital gain or loss on your tax return. Keeping track of your adjusted cost basis each year will be helpful when you finally sell your investment. Please consult your tax advisor if you have any questions or need assistance with the calculation of your cost basis, or if you have other questions regarding your reporting of distributions that you received.










What is a Form 8937 and where can I obtain a copy of the most recent one?



Any corporation (or entity that is taxed like a corporation, including our eREITs), that undergoes a stock split or a merger, pays a stock dividend, pays a “return of capital” distribution (i.e., a distribution exceeding current and accumulated earnings and profits), or otherwise undertakes an “organizational action” is required to either (i) file Form 8937 with the IRS and send copies to its shareholders or (ii) make the required information publicly available on its website. To the extent none of the above described organizational actions are taken, no Form 8937 is required. You can find any Forms 8937 that have been prepared by our eREITs, if any, on our website at www.fundrise.com.










Will my dividends be qualified?



A qualified dividend is a type of dividend which may be subject to preferential tax rates, which are usually lower than regular income tax rates. Non-qualified, ordinary dividends are taxed at the normal rate based on the individual’s ordinary income. Based on the historical operations of the eREITs and how we expect them to operate in the future, we do not expect most dividends that are issued by the eREITs will be qualified. However, to the extent that the eREITs do pay qualified dividends, they will report them as such in Box 1B.






Tax Form 1099-B








What is a Form 1099-B?



Brokers and barter exchanges must report proceeds from transactions to you and the IRS on Form 1099-B. Based on the reporting you receive on Form 1099-B, you may be required to recognize gain from the receipt of cash, stock or other property that you received in an exchange.










Why have I received a form 1099-B from my investment in a Fundrise eREIT?



As a result of the redemption plan of each eREIT, designed to provide you with regular, quarterly liquidity, we are required to report proceeds that we distribute to you in redemption of your shares to you and the IRS on Form 1099-B. If you received a Form 1099-B from us, it is likely because you received proceeds from a Fundrise eREIT from a partial or full redemption of your shares. You may be required to recognize gain from the receipt of cash, stock or other property that was received by you in exchange for eREIT shares. The eREIT that redeemed your shares in this type of transaction is identified in the box in the top-left of the form.










What is the recipient’s identification number?



For your protection, the Form 1099-B we send to you may only show the last four digits of your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) or adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN). However, we are required to report your complete identification number to the IRS and, where applicable, to state and/or local governments.










What is the account number?



Your Form 1099-B may show an account or other unique, identifying number that we have assigned to you to distinguish your account from other investors in our internal records.










What is reported in Box 1a?



Box 1a shows a brief description of the item for which the proceeds from one of your investments are being reported. If you received proceeds from transactions that must be reported on Form 1099-B from multiple eREITs, you will receive separate forms for each eREIT.










What is reported in Box 1b?



Box 1b shows the date that you acquired the securities which related to the transaction being reported. Box 1b may list “VARIOUS” if you received proceeds relating to shares that you purchased on multiple dates that were redeemed during the tax year.










What is reported in Box 1c?



Box 1c shows the effective date of the exchange being reported. This box may show “VARIOUS” if your Form 1099-B is reporting multiple exchanges in aggregate.










What is reported in Box 1d?



Box 1d shows the aggregate cash proceeds from transactions involving stocks, bonds, other debt obligations or equity instruments. This amount is generally reported on Form 8949 as explained in the instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).










What is reported in Box 1e?



Box 1e shows the cost or other tax basis of the securities sold or redeemed. Please see the Schedule D (Form 1040) instructions or Publication 550 for details about basis.










What is reported in Box 2?



Box 2 shows whether the proceeds you received should be reported as short-term gain or loss, long-term gain or loss, or ordinary income. If you received proceeds from an eREIT that would be split between short-term and long-term gain and loss based on the length of time you held your shares, you will receive multiple Forms 1099-B from your investments.










What is reported in Box 3?



Box 3 is checked when we have reported or will report your basis to the IRS.






Tax Form 1065  K-1 








What is a K-1?



A K-1 is a tax form used by partnerships to provide investors with detailed information on their share of a partnership’s taxable income. Partnerships are generally not subject to federal or state income tax, but instead issue a K-1 to each investor to report his or her share of the partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits.  The K-1s are provided to investors on an annual basis so that each investor can include K-1 amounts on his or her tax return.










Will I receive a K-1 for my Fundrise investment?



Depending on which investments you own in your portfolio, you may receive a Schedule K-1, K-1 information, or substitute K-1 (hereafter collectively referred to as K-1), a Form 1099-DIV or both. If part of your Fundrise portfolio is allocated to one or more of the eFunds, you will receive a K-1. For more information, please see the relevant Fundrise Offering Circulars at fundrise.com/oc.










When will K-1s be available to investors?



Our goal is to finalize all K-1s by March 15th, however, the eFunds may rely on outside reporting, or require additional time to furnish the forms in a way that is to the investor’s best advantage. Accordingly, you may be required to obtain one or more extensions for filing federal, state and local tax returns.










Where do I report the information contained in my K-1?



For federal tax purposes, the information provided to each investor on his or her K-1 is then included on the investor’s federal tax return. Typically, an investor must also file state tax returns in the states in which the eFund owns real property. In some cases, a composite tax filing may eliminate the need for an investor to file at the state level. Please consult with your tax advisor for more information.











How does a K-1 differ from a Form 1099-DIV?



Generally, investors that receive a Form 1099-DIV recognize dividend income equal to cash distributions received. Ordinary dividends are typically treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. When an investor receives a K-1, he or she will recognize their portion of the taxable income from the partnership but typically will not pay tax on their cash distributions. The taxable income allocated to each investor may include ordinary income, dividend income, interest income, rental real estate income, or otherwise. This income retains the same character as it had in the partnership, and should be reported on each investor’s federal tax return. Please consult your tax advisor for additional information.










Do I need to mail in my K-1 to the IRS?



No. Each eFund will submit a Form 1065 to the IRS that will include a copy of each individual investor’s K-1.










If an eFund suffers a loss, can I claim that loss as a deduction on my individual tax return?



Generally, yes, you may report your allocable share of any net losses reported by the eFund on your individual tax return (Form 1040 or other applicable tax form). Please note that the amount that you are entitled to claim as a deduction on your tax return may be less than the total loss amount reported on your K-1. Limitations that apply to deductions include IRS basis rules, at-risk limitations, and passive loss limitations. Generally, you may not claim your share of the eFund’s loss if it exceeds your adjusted basis in the eFund for the applicable tax year. Please consult the IRS or your tax advisor for additional information.










What is my tax basis in my investment in the eFund?



Generally, the capital account reflected on your K-1 should approximate your tax basis in your investment. Your capital account is computed based on your initial investment(s) in an eFund plus any allocable net income, less any net losses and/or cash distributions as reflected on your K-1. It is recommended that you keep your own running record of your cost basis in each eFund for tax purposes as there are certain instances where your tax basis may differ from your capital account balance. For additional details on how to calculate your basis, please consult your tax advisor.








The information provided is for your general guidance and is not intended to be (and cannot be relied upon as) tax advice. Investors are strongly urged to consult with their own tax advisors with regard to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding our shares and the related tax reporting requirements. The information provided below only considers selected U.S. federal income tax consequences and does not consider all U.S. federal income tax consequences or state, non-U.S. or any other tax consequences that may be applicable to a particular investor.

While the the Income eREIT is under no obligation to do so, the annualized basis return assumes that the Income eREIT will declare distributions in the future similar to the distributions disclosed herein and a constant per-share purchase price of $10 per share. The information presented in the graph represents the hypothetical, cumulative declared dividend earnings of an investor who purchased $10,000 worth of the Income eREIT (1,000 shares at $10/share) on December 3, 2015, which would have received daily declared dividends as follows: Q1 2016 - $111.06; Q2 2016 - $249.31; Q3 2016 - $277.26; Q4 2016 - $283.56; Q1 2017 - $258.90. The calculations used here only account for dividends declared by the Income eREIT and do not factor in changes in NAV. The dollar amounts are reported quarterly and are cumulative, but not compounded, over time.

Investment Summary


This is an opportunity to invest in a series of Notes tied to the performance of an 18-acre multi-family, landing pad, and climate-controlled residential property, located in Mars’ up-and-coming Red Hill Neighborhood.
Virgin Galactic acquired the land in December 2012, and has fully entitled the property through the intergalactic tribunal system. Due to overzealous California NIMBY activism, this location is arguably one of the most difficult to entitle in the solar system, but the site is now shovel-ready.
The sponsor wishes to close on a senior construction loan in December 2016. Construction is projected to take approximately three Mars years from ground breaking.
Virgin Galactic has received approval for Mars’ Multifamily Property Tax Exemption ("MMPTE") program. Under this program, taxes are exempted for up to 1,000 Mars years, requiring that 10% of the units are affordable to native earning 65% of median income for studio units, 75% for one-bedroom units, and 85% of median income for two-bedroom and larger units.
Lack of competition in the space expected to boost returns.
Exit Strategy: Spaceship.

Property Summary



As Galileo once said, "Don’t wait until later to own your own crater."
The 18-acre property sits in Mars’ Red Hill neighborhood with stunning mountain views.  Developer intends to reconstruct a nearby crater into a golf course shaped like Richard Branson’s head.
Water was recently discovered in the center (of gravity) of the property and irrigation plans are now underway. Accordingly, it is expected that rents will skyrocket.
With Virgin Galactic providing daily flights to and from Red Hill, the seven-month trip is convenient and reliable, receiving a superior AQR score than many much shorter domestic flights from United and American Airlines.
Overall, the plot is very pleasant, and the sponsor hopes that the development will add to the broader community’s atmosphere.  Notable joint venture equity co-investors include William Shatner and John Paulson of Paulson & Co.

1000 Andromeda Way

Strategy


The Income eREIT focuses primarily on making debt investments in commercial real estate assets that generate steady cash flow. To date, the Income eREIT has executed on this strategy by identifying institutional quality assets of sub-institutional size, particularly in urban metro markets.The Income eREIT has followed three core principles in selecting potential assets:* Small Assets: We believe targeting assets that fall under the radar of big banks and investment funds allows us to achieve higher relative returns.* Regulatory Inefficiencies: Increased banking regulations as a result of the 2008 financial crisis have opened up new opportunities for more flexible lenders to expand into the market.* Urban Infill Location: Generally real estate assets located in the core of large cities benefit from higher demand, and higher pricing, due to the relative lack of supply.For more information on the Income eREIT's strategy and operations, please see our in-depth Performance Analysis Report.

Fundrise To Offer Novel Product For Real Estate InvestorsGet MoreFor Your Money™  CREDIT CARDS  TRAVEL ROUND THE WORLD Fundrise To Offer Novel Product For Real Estate InvestorsFundrise, the crowdfunding platform for commercial real estate investors, last week filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an offering under Regulation A+ for a real estate investment trust (REIT). Regulation A+, a modification of an earlier rule, results from Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012. It allows non-accredited investors to purchase certain securities that previously were available only to accredited investors. The filing, a preliminary offering circular, seeks permission to launch a $50 million IPO for the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, LLC. The REIT shares will be available for sale only on Fundrise's website, not through brokers or exchanges. By eliminating broker fees and distributing shares online, Fundrise will reduce the offering's costs, and the savings of 70 to 90 percent of upfront expenses will be passed down to investors, according to the filing. By invoking Regulation A+, Fundrise avoids having to register the REIT shares with the SEC and allows non-accredited investors access to the REIT shares. An accredited investor has either $1 million in net wealth (excluding a primary residence) or income of at least $200,000 ($300,000 for joint tax filers) in each of the previous two years. Regulation A+ provides a safe harbor for companies to raise up to $50 million through the public issuance of non-registered securities. Up to now, real estate crowdfunding platforms could market to the general public but could only sell securities to accredited investors. Regulation A+, which went live in May 2015, stems from Title IV of the JOBS Act and should not be confused with Title III equity crowdfunding rules, now in final review and slated to become operational in the second quarter of 2016.Non-accredited investors will be able to invest in the Fundrise REIT to the extent of 10 percent of their net worth or annual income, whichever is greater. Fundrise will price the REIT shares at $1,000 each, meaning that folks with net worth or annual income as low as $10,000 will be able to invest. REITS are basically mutual funds for real estate properties. When you buy REIT shares, you own a proportional amount of the underlying portfolio of real estate investments controlled by the REIT manager. REITs are a way for investors to achieve instant diversification within the real estate sector. REIT investors are completely passive, in that they have no managerial responsibilities related to the portfolio properties. In its filing, Fundrise explicitly points out a number of risks to investors, including:Requiring investors to hold their shares for up to three months, as share redemption will be available on a quarterly basis.The REIT shares may turn out not be safe and viable.The disclosures required of a Regulation A+ REIT are substantially less than those of registered, listed REITs. Simply put, investors will have less information with which to make decisions.Fundrise has no experience as a REIT operator.There is no secondary market to sell the REIT shares, and Fundrise has no plans to list the shares on a trading exchange.Eric Bankupdated  Nov 24, 2015TweetEric Bank is a contributing writer at GET.com.
