John Feinstein: The lineup isn't the issue with [Nats]






Prior to Seattle's matchup with the Rams, Richard Sherman spent the week blasting the NFL for the scheduling of Thursday night games. 
The Seahawks vocal cornerback has a point. NFL games are played at such a violent level that players' bodies need a full week to recuperate. Thursday night games cut that time in half - along with time for coaches to gameplan - and the product suffers as a result. 
"I guess this is what happens when you have people in suits who have never played the game at this level dictating the schedule," he wrote in The Players' Tribune. "I’d like to put Roger Goodell in pads for a late game on a Sunday, in December, in Green Bay, on the frozen tundra — then see what time he gets to the office on Monday morning, knowing that he would have to suit up again on Thursday.
"Then maybe he’d understand."
MORE REDSKINS: VON MILLER HAS MAJOR RESPECT FOR REDSKINS PRO BOWLER
But while Sherman is right about the inherent scheduling problems with Thursday Night Football, his Seahawks have seen nothing compared to the Redskins. 
Twice this year the Skins have been dealt tremendously unfavorable conditions from week to week. 
In Week 11, the Skins played the Packers on Sunday Night Football. Four days later the Redskins faced off against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving.
Plenty of teams are forced to play Sunday to Thursday - but what made it particularly tough for Washington were the game times. The game against the Packers ended around midnight, and the Dallas game kicked at 3:30 local time. Rest for the players that week was basically not an option. 
If that weren't bad enough, Jay Gruden's team is again approaching another short week. They will face the Panthers on Monday night, which means another late-night finish. Then five days later the Skins will face the Bears in Chicago for a Saturday game. 
Again, not enough rest. And this is in the middle of a crucial playoff push. 
Sherman is right to blast the NFL, but few teams have ever had a schedule as bad as the 2016 Redskins.

RICHMOND--The expected rain seems to be holding off as the Redskins get underway here. Follow along as I live blog from the sideline. Come back and refresh often.
—A lot of special teams work in the early going. Seventh-round pick Josh Harvey-Clemons is doing a lot and paying attention. He’s a long shot to make the 53 in 2017 but he knows that his future chances hinge on special teams contributions.
—Matt Jones is participating in punt protection drills. That should not be news but I noted when he wasn’t participating in special teams in minicamp so I should note it now when he is. 
—Jamison Crowder was split out wide on one offensive snap but he came in motion and was closer to the normal slot position by the time the ball was snapped. It will be interesting to see how many snaps he takes from a true outside position. 
—If Nate Sudfeld could get rid of the extra stutter step he frequently takes before delivering some of his passes he might be able to develop. But until he gets rid of that is will be difficult for him to go anywhere. 
—Pryor dropped a deep pass in the end zone in a drill without defenders. That’s a matter of focus as much of anything else. 
—And new TE E.J. Bibbs just dropped a short one over the middle. It’s not that hot. 
—Rob Kelley made a nice, one-handed catch near the sideline with a defender right on him. If he improves pass catching he will become a complete back. 
—Matt Hazel made a move at the line and left Josh Norman in the dust on a deep pass that the receiver.
—Now we’re seeing the Pryor we’re supposed to see. He ran an in pattern against Bashaud Breeland and used his size to shield the defender and his catch radius to go up and get the ball.
—Now Zach Pascal gets open deep, leaving Kendall Fuller far behind. He holds on to the pass for the deep completion. 
—Matt Ioannidis, Phil Taylor, and A.J. Francis are left to right on the D-line on the first snap of 11 on 11. 
—Just before Kirk Cousins took a snap, D.J. Swearinger bolted up to the line and blitzed. The run play went the other way and Swearinger chased it all the way across the field. 
—For the second day in a row, a high, wobbly Nate Sudfeld pass into a group of defenders got picked off. Today’s lucky recipient of the gift pick was rookie Josh Holsey. 
—A pass went right through Matt Jones’ hands. Ouch.

Redskins camp hot topics—Mbu first team, Smith dropping pounds






RICHMOND—For the second straight year, Josh Norman will be playing in a different defensive scheme.
Last year he came to the Redskins from Carolina and had to learn Joe Barry’s defense. After the season Barry was fired and outside linebackers coach Greg Manusky took control of the defense and he has installed his philosophy. Norman likes the challenge of making the change.
“It’s pretty cool to see both sides of the spectrum, I think I only saw that one time when I was at Carolina,” said Norman. “Then coming here, we had a defensive coordinator in Joe Barry and then now, Manusky, but the thing is, he’s still in the same coaching staff as last year, he just moved up to another position. They are similar but two way-different type of schemes.
RELATED: Redskins camp hot topics
That’s is an interesting way to phrase it and some other players have echoed Norman’s sentiment. While we won’t really know what to expect until the regular season opens—we will be treated to vanilla schemes during the preseason—it seems that while the actual scheme is not all that different Manusky will call it much more aggressively.
“I like this scheme, I enjoy this scheme,” said Norman. “This is what we do and this is our backyard . . . This one right here, like I said, it feels like it’s in my backyard. It’s going to be a fun year.”
Norman made sure to day that he also liked aspects of Barry’s scheme. But apparently he prefers the nature of what Manusky is bringing to the defense.
Along with the new coordinator came a new position coach for Norman. Perry Fewell was fired and in came Torrian Gray, the former Virginia Tech secondary coach.

“I think he will help a lot, I really do,” said Norman. “He brings a sound technique background to what he does. His approach is pretty cool, it vibes well with the group. He’s a funny guy. I think that resonates with people when you have an energetic, funny guy. It comes off as ‘OK, we can rock with this and learn some stuff.’ I have been taking a few things of what he [does] and using them at our discretion, so it’s been pretty good.”
Of course, it’s easy to be happy about everything after the offseason program and one day of minicamp. Everybody is undefeated. We will see if things change of the team and the defense get off to a rocky start.
