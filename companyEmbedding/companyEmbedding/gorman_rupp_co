History[edit]
Gorman Rupp was founded in 1933 by two unemployed engineers, J.C. Gorman and Herb Rupp. They introduced self-priming, centrifugal pumps to the market; skeptical competitors trying to discredit their design instead brought attention to the young company. The company has since grown to be one of the world's largest pump manufacturers: in 2016 it had sales of $382,100,000.[2]
Products[edit]
Gorman-Rupp's line of pump products include self-priming centrifugal pumps, standard centrifugal pumps, submersible pumps, trash pumps, priming assisted pumps, rotary gear pumps and air-driven diaphragm pumps.[2]

History[edit]
Gorman Rupp was founded in 1933 by two unemployed engineers, J.C. Gorman and Herb Rupp. They introduced self-priming, centrifugal pumps to the market; skeptical competitors trying to discredit their design instead brought attention to the young company. The company has since grown to be one of the world's largest pump manufacturers: in 2016 it had sales of $382,100,000.[2]
Products[edit]
Gorman-Rupp's line of pump products include self-priming centrifugal pumps, standard centrifugal pumps, submersible pumps, trash pumps, priming assisted pumps, rotary gear pumps and air-driven diaphragm pumps.[2]
