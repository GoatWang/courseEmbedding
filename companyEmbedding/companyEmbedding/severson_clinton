He and his wife loved to play cards.  Euchre was one of the games they played.  If you know how to play, then you know that it is a poor play to trump your partner's ace.  I did that once and I knew by the tone in his voice, that was not the right thing to do.  Just like life, you have to play the game right and Clint sure did.
