    Robert Edward Rice, 66, formerly of Midland, died in Indianapolis, Ind., on Friday, Dec. 19, 2008, from injuries sustained during a fall.

    He was born in Detroit in 1942, the son of Herbert F. and Dorothy (Zimmer) Rice. He graduated from Redford High School and subsequently earned bachelor and master of music degrees from Michigan State University. In 1984 he married Suzanne Schaar in Midland.

    Following a year of teaching in Belding, he accepted a position in 1967 with Midland Public Schools. He served as music director at Central Intermediate School, where he conducted the choir, band and orchestra, in addition to traveling to elementary schools to teach beginning instrumental music, until his retirement in 1990. He also was a member of the Midland Symphony Orchestra, playing piccolo and flute.

    Foremost among his musical talents, by inclination and training, Bob was an organist. He was director of music at Trinity Lutheran Church in Midland for many years and was instrumental in the design and installation in the 1970's of the Schantz pipe organ that is still in service. He delighted in rattling the rafters with full and exuberant registrations, much to the appreciation of fellow musicians and the dismay of more conservative congregation members.

    Bob was also a great animal lover, never able to pass up an opportunity to make friends with a passing creature. From 1993-2000, he took advantage of employment at the Indianapolis Zoo, coming home happy with stories of his meetings with animals large and small.

    He also enjoyed sharing gourmet meals, good wine, lively conversation and laughter with friends, traveling and the many gifts of nature.

    Survivors include his wife, Suzanne of Muncie, Ind.; sister Kay Ferranto of San Juan Capistrano, Calif.; niece Jennifer Newton and husband Craig of Long Beach, Calif.; parents-in-law Hershel and Karen Schaar; brother-in-law Matthew Schaar and friend Nicole Presnell of Baton Rouge, La.; friends Fred and Maureen Ehnes of Muncie, Ind., who were so close as to be considered family; and Moose and Rocket, beloved feline members of the household.

    Per his request, his remains were cremated and a memorial service will take place in January. Persons wishing to offer memorial contributions may direct them to PETsMART Charities, 10000 N. 31st Ave., Suite C-100, Phoenix, AZ 85051 or the donor's favorite organization.
