FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

Collecting Fan Insights
Our goal is to give your fans an experience they can’t find anywhere else. So every program, every practice and every innovation is grounded in insights gathered from our in-depth research on the fans themselves. 
Using methods like primary research studies and focus groups, among others, we rigorously analyze relevant data on evolving trends, tastes, habits and behaviors among your specific fan base. We then take those insights and transform them into programs and state-of-the art technologies that give your guests what they want. 
Whether it’s an easy mobile payment option or a venue-specific loyalty program, our extensive research makes for a better fan experience.


Real-Time Response
In order to create an unforgettable experience, it is our responsibility to be diligent in responding to fans’ needs as they arise. We have the tools and technology to monitor, measure, adjust and improve every detail of your fans’ experience in real-time.
We install management dashboards that provide our managers with a comprehensive, real-time look at daily operations.

                                    As the global health food trend grew, fans at stadiums and arenas across the country were seeking fresher choices in addition to traditional stadium menu options. At Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, our client and team members had an idea—to bring healthier, locally grown options into the stadium while promoting sustainability.

Innovation

                                    Working hand-in-hand with agriculture and landscape students from Colorado State University and the Colorado Rockies, we planned, planted and cultivated a first-of-its-kind sustainable garden outside Gate A of the ballpark. We then took the freshly harvested herbs and vegetables and used them in recipes and salad stations at the ballpark’s restaurant.

Impact

                                    The garden was a hit. Our team at Coors Field was not only building a more sustainable community and future but also providing fans and guests fresher menu options than they would get at a typical stadium. Going forward, we’ll look to continually innovate and improve our food services at all the stadiums and arenas we serve.

Insight

                                    Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver, Colorado is a world-famous outdoor venue continually recognized for its star-studded concert roster and natural acoustics. It's also an important treasure to protect. One of Denver's sustainability goals  is to reduce landfill waste in the city by 20% overall by the year 2020. To help preserve the natural beauty of this venue, our team, along with our client the City of Denver, which owns and operates the amphitheater, are working with Eco-Products® to help increase the diversion rate at Red Rocks.

Innovation

                                    Working with Eco-Products®, we are now using sustainable food packaging - compostable cups, plates and trays – throughout the venue. The Eco-Products® packaging has a high quality look and feel and are embossed with a special logo reminding patrons that the packaging is compostable. The products can be disposed of in any of the venue’s trash bins and at the end of an event, after the Red Rocks employees collect and sort the waste, it is hauled away to be added to other compostable materials and ultimately turned into organic materials.

Impact

                                    Not all foodservice packaging can be recycled but by using Eco-Products® compostable packing, we are taking another step to keep food packaging out of landfills. With this new relationship, Red Rocks has been able to divert about 75 percent of the waste generated by events.

Exclusive Retail Merchandise
We work closely with industry leaders to develop products that fans won’t find anywhere else.

Commemorating a one-of-a-kind experience deserves merchandise that’s just as unique. That’s why we stock all of our stores with exclusive products that your fans want and can only find in your stadium, like player-inspired clothing lines or special event memorabilia. 
Over the years, we’ve developed close relationships with top vendors around the world, including Nike®, New Era®, Reebok®, Majestic® and 47 Brand®, and we work hand-in-hand with those vendors to develop the most innovative products in the industry.

We balance an expert team with state-of-the-art technology and best-in-class intelligence tools to give you nothing short of the most robust insights and analytics program in the industry. 


We dive deep into your stadium market and fan base specifically to learn more about the way they think and behave when it comes to making purchasing decisions.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
