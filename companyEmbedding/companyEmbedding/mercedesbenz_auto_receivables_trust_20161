Fitch Rates Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1
    





September 14, 2016 11:51 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Mercedes-Benz Auto 
      Receivables Trust 2016-1 (MBART 20161) notes:
    

      --$350,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$500,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$532,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$115,970,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool has a weighted average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 768, consistent with recent MBART 
      transactions, and has over 15 months of seasoning indicating a strong 
      prime credit quality pool.
    

      Weaker Loan Attributes: Loans with original term greater than or equal 
      to 61 months total 73.9%, the highest to date for an MBART pool, and 
      used vehicles represent the majority of the vehicles in 2016-1. The WA 
      loan to value (LTV) is 106.3%, consistent with 2015-1 (NR) and 2014-1 
      but up from all transactions prior to 2014.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Total initial hard credit enhancement 
      (CE) for class A notes is 2.75%, consistent with 2015-1 (not rated [NR] 
      by Fitch). Yield supplement overcollateralization (OC) is used to boost 
      the transaction's annual percentage rate (APR), providing expected 
      excess spread of 2.64%. CE is sufficient to cover in excess of a 5.0x 
      multiple of Fitch's 1.00% base case cumulative net loss (CNL).
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: MBFS' portfolio and 
      securitization performance has been strong with low delinquencies and 
      losses over the past five years.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Daimler or MBFS would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes MBFS to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter and servicer for prime auto loan 
      collateral, as evidenced by the historical delinquency and loss 
      performance of its securitizations and managed portfolio.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential negative rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      MBART 2016-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minimal 
      sensitivity to a moderate increase in defaults and losses, under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. However, class A notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's 
      severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recomputing 
      certain information with respect to 100 receivables from the data file. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by

Fitch Expects to Rate Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1; 
      Presale Issued
    





September 06, 2016 08:31 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to the 
      Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 (MBART 20161) notes:
    

      --$292,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$418,000,000 class A-2A/B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$442,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$96,230,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool has a weighted average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 768, consistent with recent MBART 
      transactions, and has over 15 months of seasoning indicating a strong 
      prime credit quality pool.
    

      Weaker Loan Attributes: Loans with original term greater than or equal 
      to 61 months total 73.9%, the highest to date for an MBART pool, and 
      used vehicles represent the majority of the vehicles in 2016-1. The WA 
      LTV is 106.3%, consistent with 2015-1 (NR) and 2014-1 but up from all 
      transactions prior to 2014.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Total initial hard credit enhancement 
      (CE) for class A notes is 2.75%, consistent with 2015-1 (not rated [NR] 
      by Fitch). Yield supplement overcollateralization (OC) is used to boost 
      the transaction's annual percentage rate (APR), providing expected 
      excess spread of 2.61%. CE is sufficient to cover in excess of a 5.0x 
      multiple of Fitch's 1.00% base case cumulative net loss (CNL).
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: MBFS' portfolio and 
      securitization performance has been strong with low delinquencies and 
      losses over the past five years.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Daimler or MBFS would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes MBFS to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter and servicer for prime auto loan 
      collateral, as evidenced by the historical delinquency and loss 
      performance of its securitizations and managed portfolio.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential negative rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      MBART 2016-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minimal 
      sensitivity to a moderate increase in defaults and losses, under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. However, class A notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's 
      severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.}
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recomputing 
      certain information with respect to 100 receivables from the data file. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Expects to Rate Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1; Presale Issued



2016-09-06 13:56:45









NEW YORK--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to the Mercedes-Benz Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 (MBART 20161) notes:
--$292,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
--$418,000,000 class A-2A/B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$442,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$96,230,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Strong Collateral Quality: The pool has a weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 768, consistent with recent MBART transactions, and has over 15 months of seasoning indicating a strong prime credit quality pool.
Weaker Loan Attributes: Loans with original term greater than or equal to 61 months total 73.9%, the highest to date for an MBART pool, and used vehicles represent the majority of the vehicles in 2016-1. The WA LTV is 106.3%, consistent with 2015-1 (NR) and 2014-1 but up from all transactions prior to 2014.
Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Total initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for class A notes is 2.75%, consistent with 2015-1 (not rated [NR] by Fitch). Yield supplement overcollateralization (OC) is used to boost the transaction's annual percentage rate (APR), providing expected excess spread of 2.61%. CE is sufficient to cover in excess of a 5.0x multiple of Fitch's 1.00% base case cumulative net loss (CNL).
Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: MBFS' portfolio and securitization performance has been strong with low delinquencies and losses over the past five years.
Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of Daimler or MBFS would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.
Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes MBFS to be a capable originator, underwriter and servicer for prime auto loan collateral, as evidenced by the historical delinquency and loss performance of its securitizations and managed portfolio.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential negative rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MBART 2016-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minimal sensitivity to a moderate increase in defaults and losses, under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. However, class A notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.}
USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 100 receivables from the data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 2016.

Did you know that the parent company of Mercedes was the first to build a true automobile? Just over two decades after the U.S. Civil War had ended (And a mere sixteen years after the founding of modern Germany), Karl Benz was granted a patent for his “Motorwagen.” The vehicle came out in January of 1886, and was powered by a single cylinder, four-stroke engine of his own design.
Cars in general have come a long way in 120 years – especially the Mercedes. The Mercedes Benz has long been famous for its quality engineering and reliability, but it doesn’t stay that way by itself. Even the most legendary driving machine will deteriorate if not properly maintained, and that is why every Mercedes owner needs a source for discount Mercedes parts. The Mercedes parts that most typically wear out – aside from engine filters – are the hoses and belts, which should be inspected about every three to six months for signs of age, brittleness and cracking. Mercedes parts associated with the electrical system are next on the list.  Like radiator hoses, plug wires can become brittle and crack with age. Make sure these plug wires are of high quality and shielded so as to avoid electro-magnetic interference with your car’s electric accessories as well as “cross-talk” – a potentially serious condition in which electric current can literally jump from one wire to another and cause serious damage. By investing in quality Mercedes parts, you’ll avoid costly repairs and enjoy a reliable vehicle for many years.

"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?" That's the opening line of "Mercedes-Benz," a song most famously recorded by singer Janis Joplin in the early 1970s. The tune gently poked fun at materialism and our desire for the finer things in life. It's fitting that the renowned German marque figures prominently in the lyric. Mercedes-Benz has long been known for crafting vehicles that emphasize luxury and refinement. For many, its vehicles are sleek symbols of status, success and good taste.
In January of 1886, Karl Benz unveiled the world's first automobile, a three-wheeled vehicle dubbed the Benz Patent Motor Car. A few months later, Gottlieb Daimler and his chief engineer Wilhelm Maybach rolled out a four-wheeled vehicle powered by his Daimler engine. The first Mercedes was crafted in 1901, shortly after Daimler's death. Built by Maybach, the car was commissioned by Emil Jellinek, one of Daimler's primary distributors, and was ultimately named after Jellinek's daughter, Mercedes.
In 1926, the companies founded by Daimler and Benz merged to form Daimler-Benz AG, and the Mercedes-Benz brand was born. The company's insignia was a three-pointed star wreathed in a laurel; the star was dreamed up by Daimler years earlier, and its three points signified the fact that his engines were used in vehicles that traveled land, air and sea.
Right from the start, the Mercedes-Benz name was synonymous with automotive excellence. One of the automaker's earliest vehicles, the 1931 Mercedes-Benz 170, distinguished itself as the world's first production car to offer a technology that was nothing short of extraordinary for the day: four-wheel independent suspension. The '30s and '40s saw Mercedes establishing itself as the brand of choice for car buyers seeking the ultimate in luxury, thanks to coveted cruisers like the 380 and 540K.
The 1950s witnessed the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL "Gullwing," a sports car that has been described as being the world's first supercar. With its dramatic styling and race-bred technology, the 300 SL reigns today as a classic coveted by collectors worldwide. The decade also saw Daimler-Benz making strides in the area of safety technology. The company's Mercedes-Benz 220 sedans were the first vehicles to incorporate its patented "crumple zone" body design, created to absorb impact in the event of a crash.
In 1963, the company cemented its reputation as the home of automotive luxury with the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 600. The elegant, luxurious sedan was also available as a limousine and featured an ahead-of-its-time air suspension system and a V8 engine that boasted 300 horsepower. The decade also saw the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3. This full-size sedan went from zero to 60 in under seven seconds, distinguishing itself as the quickest luxury car is its day.
The 1970s saw the birth of the brand's storied S-Class line of vehicles, opulent sedans and coupes that coddled passengers with powerful engines and a long list of luxury features. The decade also saw Mercedes continuing on the cutting edge of safety technology, by being the first to offer antilock brakes in its vehicles.
Daimler-Benz's safety advancements continued in the 1980s. Its cars were the first to offer airbags and traction control. The manufacturer also raised the bar in terms of ride comfort and handling when it introduced multilink rear suspension. The technology debuted on the compact Mercedes-Benz 190 E, and it remains a vital component of the company's chassis engineering to this day.
Mercedes-Benz vehicles got an extra dose of power and performance in the 1990s, thanks to the manufacturer's partnership with AMG, a performance and tuning shop that was eventually purchased by the company to help produce ultra-high-performance versions of some of its vehicles. The first AMG model offered in the U.S. was the sporty C36 AMG in 1995; since then, Mercedes has gone on to offer an AMG-tuned version of almost all of its vehicles.
The company's current lineup is the most comprehensive in its history. With a variety of sedans, coupes, SUVs and roadsters filling Mercedes showrooms, it seems like the only thing missing is a pickup truck. Surely, the fact that Janis Joplin's song holds as much relevance today as it did four decades ago is a strong indicator that the brand's premier status is still very much intact.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
