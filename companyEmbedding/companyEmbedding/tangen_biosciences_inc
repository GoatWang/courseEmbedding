John R. NobilePresident & ceoJohn is a co-founder of Tangen Biosciences, Inc. and has 29 years of product development experience, including 12 years designing nucleic acid research instruments, and is the lead inventor on over 40 patents.  John started his career at Pitney-Bowes in 1986.  There for 7 years, he was the lead engineer and chief architect of 7 highly successful products across 3 product lines.  For the following 9 years he was a product development consultant, where he was the lead engineer or consulting engineer on over 20 successful products in a variety of industries, including healthcare products such as endoscopic surgical tools and patient monitoring devices.  He was also a consultant to the molded plastics industry, where he provided technical solutions for the most challenging precision part designs. In 2002 John began consulting for 454 Life Sciences, where he eventually joined and became the key architect of the mechanical, fluidic, and disposable kit systems for the first commercial next generation sequencing system, the GS20, launched in 2005.  John was also the chief architect of the much improved GS FLX sequencing platform launched in 2007, and also the GS Junior.  John left 454/Roche in 2009 to go to work for Ion Torrent (acquired by Life Technologies), where he was lead mechanical engineer responsible for the design and implementation of all physical systems.  John Nobile and Dr. Davidson worked together at Life Technologies to launch PGM (Personal Genome Machine), PROTON (larger scale sequencer), and the One Touch emulsion PCR machine.  John is the inventor on over 40 patents, and is an author on multiple next generation sequencing publications.  John has a BS, Mechanical & Materials Engineering from Univ. Conn.John holds a Bachelor of Science, Mechanical and Materials Engineering, from University of Connecticut.You can reach John at john.nobile@tangenbio.com. John Davidson, phdCSOJohn, or "JD", is chief science officer and a co-founder of Tangen Biosciences, and received a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Harvard University in 2000.  Since then he has spent the last 14 years working on assays and technologies involving DNA: Mutation detection in cancer, Gene synthesis, DNA sequencing instruments.  JD joined Blue Heron Biotechnology in 2003, where he was instrumental in developing cell-free DNA error correction processes and automating gene synthesis.  JD joined Ion Torrent in April 2008, before the company had demonstrated proof of concept and prior to acquisition by Life Technologies in 2010.  JD was the Senior Director for Research and Development for the Proton DNA sequencer from Life Technologies and the Molecular Biology technical lead for developing and commercializing the One Touch automated sample prep instruments that support the sequencers.You can reach John at john.davidson@tangenbio.com. Richard Carroll, PhDVP Business Development and Regulatory AffairsDick Carroll joined Tangen Biosciences in Jan, 2015, after having been involved in diagnostics for 4 decades.  He has led the clearing of seven diagnostic related devices through the FDA.  Dick is the author of 5 patents and numerous publications in HIV and blood cell separation. While completing his Ph.D. and working at Corning, he acquired several patents for the separation of blood cells in a blood collection tube.  The technology was acquired by Becton Dickinson in 1987 and Dick developed the Cell Preparation Tube (CPT™) at BD.  Collaborations with Roche, Chiron, and Organon Teknika resulted in the Plasma Preparation Tube (PPT™) for use in each company’s gene amplification technologies: PCR, bDNA, and NASBA.  Dick collaborated extensively with Pharma companies developing anti-retroviral drugs in the 1990’s, since both tubes were essential in clinical trials after they were adapted by the NIH’s AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG).  The PPT is currently used in every blood donation in North America to screen for infectious agents.  In 1997 he joined Visible Genetics and led the development of a gene sequencing technology to detect HIV mutations associated with drug resistance.  The TruGene™ technology was cleared in 2002 as the first gene sequencing technology cleared by the FDA. Visible Genetics was acquired by Bayer. In 2002, Dick joined Millennium and was the PI in clinical trials involving metabolic studies in HIV+ individuals. The technology was acquired by Inergetics, Inc. In 2004, he joined Cascade Medical and developed a blood collection tube for blood platelet enrichment (FIBRINET™) for use in wound care and managed several clinical trials. The technology was cleared by the FDA in 2005, and Cascade was acquired by ConnMed Linvatec in 2009.In 2009, Dick joined HistoRx as VP for Clinical Research, and was responsible for establishing collaborations with Pharma by developing quantitative immunohistochemical assays.  HistoRx was acquired by Novartis in Nov, 2012.  In 2013, Dick became President of ViveBio, and was responsible for the promotion of specimen transport technology used in MDx.You can reach Dick at richard.carroll@tangenbio.com Brian chiricoVP Operations  noemi OlivoVP Quality Assurance and Compliance  Mark Holodniy, MDClinical Research Collaborator  Dr. Holodniy's research has focused on infectious diseases, specifically on evaluation of novel anti-infective compounds and diagnostics, and clinical outcome evaluation through assessment of practice patterns and epidemiology of infectious disease. Mark has overseen the conduct of over 75 clinical and diagnostic device trials since 1991 and is a co-inventor on 3 patents for HIV-1 viral load testing. Nationally, he directs the VA Office of Public Health Surveillance & Research, including the VHA Public Health Reference Laboratory (PHRL), which is responsible for biosurveillance, and lookback and outbreak investigations in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Mark's early work focused on development and validation of molecular assays that would detect and quantitate HIV viral load (VL) in blood and body fluids. These publications were the first to demonstrate the utility of quantifying HIV viral load and demonstrating reduction of VL with antiretroviral treatment.  In addition to HIV-associated laboratory work, he has conducted extensive research on HCV, influenza, and GBV-C virus.   Throughout his career, he has been involved in conducting human clinical trials for both medications and diagnostic devices. Many of these multi-center studies have been associated with the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) where he served as a coordinating center director, study chairman, and site investigator.  Sarah M. Fortune, MDScience AdviserDr. Fortune's research focus has been on the molecular basis of population heterogeneity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the extent to which differences between mycobacterial cells contribute to differences in disease and treatment outcomes.  Her work combines bacterial genetic approaches with high throughput methodologies.  Her laboratory uses techniques such as high density whole genome sequencing, RNAseq and quantitative live cell imaging to define the molecular mechanisms by which Mtb generates diversity and how this diversity enables the bacterium to survive subsequent selective forces including antibiotics and immune selection.  Her group further seeks to understand the impact of host immune responses and HIV on the interaction of Mtb with the infected host, again working at both single cell and genomic levels.  Dr. Fortune’s lab uses computational modeling to integrate diverse data sets in order to understand how these processes contribute to the course and burden of human disease.  Her work engages a broad network of collaborators including experts in technologies to assess single cell behavior at MIT and MGH, experts in sequencing methodologies at the Broad Institute and experts in human immunology at the Ragon Institute, where Dr. Fortune is Director of the TB Program.  Michael Kinch, PHDScience AdviserMichael is currently Associate Vice Chancellor & Director for the Center for Research Innovation in Business, and Professor of Radiation Oncology at Washington University in St Louis, St. Louis, MO.  Mike was formerly the Managing Director of the Yale Center for Molecular Discovery, and is also co-founder and Chair of Advisory Board for the Institute for Life Sciences Collaboration, a not-for-profit organization to encourage and enhance development of scientific innovation by joining leading Academic life sciences communities, thus addressing the need for expertise, infrastructure and applications to identify, advance and accelerate entrepreneurial opportunities in life sciences R&D.  Recently, he has become an advisor to Lewis and Clark Venture Fund.Michael was previously Chief Scientific Officer & Vice President, Research and Development at Functional Genetics, and before that was the Head of the Departments of Cancer Biology and Translational Research for MedImmune, Inc.       Tangen Biosciences, Inc.             780 East Main St, Suite 1,         Branford, CT 06405
