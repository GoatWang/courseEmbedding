About





Positive outcomes. Positive patient stories.
At Paratek, solutions are provided that enable positive outcomes and lead to positive patient stories. Paratek Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company that develops transformative solutions for patients, both in and out of the hospital, with diseases that are not responsive to current treatments.
We focus on drugs that target infectious disease and other difficult to treat conditions.
Today, we have a particularly promising antibiotic called Omadacycline for serious community acquired infections where resistance is of concern.
Four core elements serve as the foundation upon which our brand is built.  They guide how we communicate, how we act and the experiences we create for our stakeholders.
 
Paratek Pharmaceuticals is built on 4 values




Purposeful

We have a disciplined team with proven capabilities to develop and commercialize new treatment solutions for complex medical solutions.





Passionate

We have unwavering passion for bringing effective solutions to patients, persevering through obstacles and building momentum to help people, empower physicians, and generate returns for investors.







Resourceful

We use the highest caliber research and development processes to harness the power of tetracycline-based chemistry, innovating to develop new compounds for a multitude of indications.





Collaborative

We are advancing science, working together to develop new compounds, and partnering with others to bring high impact solutions to physicians and openly sharing our progress and perspectives.



Core Insight
Everybody has a story about their healthcare. Many are stories of healing – the kind of stories we work towards everyday. Yet some have unhappier endings, poor outcomes; whether it’s an unsuccessful treatment, a serious side effect or a life threatening complication, these might have been avoided. The smallest decisions tip the scales. With the right drugs, the right knowledge and the right people, we can transform those everyday decisions into everyday triumphs.
In the end, data isn’t remembered - stories are. Physicians want their patients to have the best stories possible.
 
Our Promise
To empower physicians with the tools they need to create better stories. We’re on a mission to help turn every day decisions into everyday triumphs for patients with diseases that are not responsive to current treatments.
At Paratek, we provide solutions that enable positive outcomes and lead to positive patient stories. Read what our employees have to say about working to keep this promise.
 

We all have an opportunity to make a positive impact with the advancement of Omadacycline. For me, and for the company, that’s very exciting.
Joanne Tatem, Director of Project Management

We're stepping into a new stage for anti-infectives. The passion of the leadership team and the board is truly palpable.

Developments
Paratek's lead candidate, omadacycline, is the first in a new class of tetracyclines known as aminomethylcyclines, with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and atypical bacteria. 
Omadacycline is a new, once-daily, oral and IV, well-tolerated, broad-spectrum antibiotic being developed for use as empiric monotherapy for patients suffering from serious community-acquired bacterial infections, such as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), urinary tract infections (UTI), and other community-acquired bacterial infections, particularly when antibiotic resistance is of concern.
We believe omadacycline will be used to treat patients in both the community and hospital setting.  We have designed omadacycline to overcome many of the limitations of existing antibiotics. Omadacycline has a broad spectrum of activity, including activity against commonly resistant bacteria; it is dosed once daily and has both an oral and intravenous (IV) formulation. In clinical trials omadacycline has shown a favorable safety and tolerability profile.
As resistance to older antibiotic therapy continues to cause treatment failure we believe that omadacycline will become the primary antibiotic choice of physicians for use as an empiric monotherapy for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections and other serious community-acquired bacterial infections.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted omadacycline a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and completed two special protocol assessments for its Phase 3 clinical trial program.
Our second Phase 3 product candidate, sarecycline, is a new, once-daily, oral tetracycline-derived compound for the potential treatment of acne and rosacea in the community setting. Sarecycline was designed to be a well-tolerated, once-daily, oral, narrow spectrum antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties. Paratek has licensed the U.S. rights to Allergan for the development and commercialization of sarecycline. Paratek retains all ex-U.S. rights.

To announce positive top-line results from pivotal Phase 3 clinical study


Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Phase 3 Study of Oral-Only Dosing of Omadacycline Met All Primary and Secondary FDA and EMA Efficacy Endpoints in Acute Bacterial Skin Infections
Jul 17 17
Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced positive top-line results from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study comparing its once-daily, oral investigational antibiotic, omadacycline, to twice-daily oral linezolid in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). The study met all of its primary and secondary endpoints required to support approval for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This represents the third positive Phase 3 registration study of omadacycline. The pivotal Phase 3 clinical study known as OASIS-2 (Omadacycline in Acute Skin Structure Infections Study) evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily, oral-only omadacycline compared to twice-daily, oral-only linezolid in 735 adults with ABSSSI. Omadacycline met the FDA-specified primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority (NI) in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (10% NI margin, 95% confidence interval) compared to linezolid at the early clinical response (ECR), 48 to 72 hours after the first dose of study drug. The ECR rate for omadacycline was 87.5% compared to 82.5% for linezolid. Additionally, omadacycline met statistical NI compared to linezolid for the EMA-specified co-primary endpoints at the post therapy evaluation (PTE), 7 to 14 days after completion of therapy in the mITT and the Clinically Evaluable (CE) populations. Clinical success rates at PTE in the mITT population for the omadacycline and linezolid arms were 84.2% vs. 80.8%, respectively; and in the CE population were 97.9% vs. 95.5%, respectively. Omadacycline demonstrated high clinical success rates for infections caused by the most common ABSSSI pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

	Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.


	On April 21, 2017, Paratek Bermuda Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, “Paratek”), and Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“Zai”) entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”).


	 


	Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Paratek granted Zai an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and

	commercialize

	omadacycline in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (the “Territory”) for all human therapeutic and preventative uses, other than biodefense. Zai will be responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the licensed product in the Territory, at its sole cost with certain assistance from Paratek.


	 


	Zai will pay Paratek an upfront license fee of $7.5 million and potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments. Zai will also pay Paratek tiered royalties at a low double digit to mid-teen percent on net sales of the licensed product in the Territory.


	 



	The Collaboration Agreement will continue on a region-by-region basis until Zai’s payment of all its payment obligations, unless earlier terminated according to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party, or an insolvency event of the other party.



	 



	If Zai terminates the Collaboration Agreement due to Paratek’s material breach, or the Collaboration Agreement is terminated by either party after regulatory approval of the licensed product, Paratek will pay to Zai royalties on net sales of the Licensed Product in the Territory at a rate to be determined by the parties’ good faith negotiations. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, upon termination of the Collaboration Agreement, all rights to


	omadacycline will revert back to Paratek.



	 



	The foregoing description of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Collaboration Agreement, a copy of which Paratek intends to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.





	 






	Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure.



	On April 24, 2017, Paratek and Zai issued a joint press release announcing entrance into the Collaboration Agreement. A copy of the joint press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.




	The information contained in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished and shal


	l not be deemed to be “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.









	Item 8.01  Other Events.


	 



	As previously disclosed, in October 2015 and March 2017, Paratek established at-the-market equity offering programs pursuant to which Paratek may from time to time sell shares of its common stock at then current market prices of up to $50.0 million under each program through Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., as sales agent. Since January 1, 2017, Paratek has received $69.2 million, net of commissions paid, in proceeds pursuant to these programs from the sale of 3,829,644 shares of its common stock.






	Based upon Paratek’s current operating plan, Paratek anticipates that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the remaining $10.0 million line of credit from Paratek’s Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, with Hercules Technology II, L.P., Hercules Technology III, L.P., certain other lenders and Hercules



	 




	 



	Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (as agent) and anticipated upfront and milestone payments from Paratek’s Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Allergan, plc and the Collaboration Agre

	Paratek Pharmaceuticals and Zai Lab Announce Collaboration, Development and License Agreement for Omadacycline in China


	 


	BOSTON, April 24, 2017

	--


	Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRTK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies based upon tetracycline chemistry,


	today announced that it has entered into a collaboration with Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., a biopharmaceutical company based in China, to support the development and commercialization of omadacycline for patients in China.



	 


	Under the agreement, Paratek has granted to Zai Lab an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline for the greater China territory, specifically the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan markets.  The companies will establish a joint steering committee to review and oversee all development, manufacturing, and commercialization plans. Paratek will receive a $7.5 million upfront payment in connection with the signing of the agreement and is eligible for additional milestone payments related to development, regulatory, and commercial milestones.  In addition, Paratek will be eligible to receive royalty payments on sales of omadacycline in the territory.


	 


	"Our successful Phase 3 efficacy studies in both skin infections and pneumonia demonstrate the potential of omadacycline to be a promising new therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with serious bacterial infections," said Michael Bigham, Chairman and CEO of Paratek. "This agreement with Zai Lab further validates that potential, and represents an exciting step toward making omadacycline available to the many patients in the greater China territory where there is a proven need for a new, effective, well-tolerated, IV and once-daily oral, broad-spectrum antibiotic, particularly when resistance is of concern."

	                                                

	Samantha Du, Chairman and CEO of Zai Lab, added, "We are very pleased to partner with Paratek to potentially bring omadacycline to Chinese patients. It is estimated that per capita use of antibiotics in China is significantly higher than that in the United States. Consequently, antibiotic resistance is becoming an increasing and severe problem for China. Based on the data generated by Paratek to date, we believe omadacycline has the potential to be a valuable new tool for physicians in China as they try to combat the growing antibiotic resistance problem."


	 


	Omadacycline is a new, once-daily oral and intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic being developed for use as empiric monotherapy for patients suffering from serious community-acquired bacterial infections, such as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract

	infections, and other community-acquired bacterial infections, particularly when antibiotic resistance is of concern to prescribing physicians.

	Omadacycline has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation and Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the target indications.

A Phase 3 registration study in ABSSSI comparing once-daily oral-only dosing of omadacycline to twice-daily oral-only dosing of linezolid was initiated in August 2016. Top-line data from this study are expected as early as the end of June. The Company plans to submit its new drug application (NDA) in the U.S. as early as the first quarter of 2018 with an EMA submission later in 2018.


	 


	In addition to its Phase 3 program for omadacycline, a Phase 1B study in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) was initiated in May 2016 and positive top-line PK proof-of-principle data was reported in November 2016. The Company plans to begin enrolling patients in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of omadacycline in acute pyelonephritis, the most common subset of complicated urinary tract infections, as early as December 2017.


	 


	In October 2016, Paratek announced a research agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to explore the utility of omadacycline against pathogenic agents causing infectious diseases of public health and biodefense importance including plague and anthrax.


	 


	Paratek's second Phase 3 product candidate, sarecycline, is a well-tolerated, once-daily oral, narrow spectrum tetracycline-derived antibiotic with potent anti-inflammatory properties for the potential treatment of acne and rosacea in the community setting. Allergan owns the U.S. rights for the development and commercialization of sarecycline. Paratek retains all ex-U.S. rights. Allergan and Paratek reported positive results from two identical Phase 3 registration studies of sarecycline for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in March 2017. Allergan has publicly announced plans to submit an NDA in the U.S. in the second half of 2017.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

BOSTON, June  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRTK) today announced that Evan Loh, MD, President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Medical Officer, will participate in a panel discussion at the JMP Securities Life Science Conference on Wednesday, June 21. The panel titled Antibiotics will begin at 12:30 p.m. ET. The conference is being held at the St. Regis New York in New York City. Paratek is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies based upon tetracycline chemistry.About ParatekParatek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies based upon its expertise in novel tetracycline chemistry. Paratek's lead product candidate, omadacycline, when approved, will be the first in a new class of tetracyclines known as aminomethylcyclines, with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and atypical bacteria. Omadacycline is a new, once-daily oral and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic being developed for use as empiric monotherapy for patients suffering from serious community-acquired bacterial infections, such as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and other community-acquired bacterial infections, particularly when antibiotic resistance is of concern to prescribing physicians. Omadacycline has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation and Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the target indications. In June 2016, Paratek announced positive efficacy data in a Phase 3 registration study in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) demonstrating the efficacy and general safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) to once-daily oral omadacycline compared to linezolid. In April 2017, Paratek announced positive efficacy data in a Phase 3 registration study in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) demonstrating the efficacy and general safety and tolerability of IV to once-daily oral omadacycline compared to moxifloxacin. A Phase 3 registration study in ABSSSI comparing once-daily oral-only dosing of omadacycline to twice-daily oral-only dosing of linezolid was initiated in August 2016. This study completed enrollment in May 2017 and top-line data are expected in mid-July. The Company plans to submit its new drug application (NDA) in the U.S. as early as the first quarter of 2018 with an EMA submission later in 2018. In addition to its Phase 3 program for omadacycline, a Phase 1B study in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) was initiated in May 2016 and positive top-line PK proof-of-principle data was reported in November 2016. The Company plans to begin enrolling patients in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of omadacycline in acute pyelonephritis, the most common subset of complicated urinary tract infections, as early as December 2017. In October 2016, Paratek announced a research agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to explore the utility of omadacycline against pathogenic agents causing infectious diseases of public health and biodefense importance including plague and anthrax. In April 2017, Paratek Bermuda Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company granted Zai an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize omadacycline in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, for all human therapeutic and preventative uses, other than biodefense. Paratek's second Phase 3 product candidate, sarecycline, is a well-tolerated, once-daily oral, narrow spectrum tetracycline-derived antibiotic with potent anti-inflammatory properties for the potential treatment of acne and rosacea in the community setting. Allergan owns the U.S. rights for the development and commercialization of sarecycline. Paratek retains all ex-U.S. rights. Allergan and Paratek reported positive results from two identical Phase 3 registration studies of sarecycline for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in March 2017. Allergan has publicly announced plans to submit an NDA in the U.S. in the second half of 2017.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.
