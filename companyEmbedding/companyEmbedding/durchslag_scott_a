At Motorola, he was also part of the team that enabled Motorola's market share to double, launched its then leading RAZR product and created strategic partnerships with other technology leaders, including Google and Microsoft. Earlier, Mr. Durchslag worked at software startups in Silicon Valley, one of which was Grand Central Networks that was later purchased by Google. A former McKinsey & Company partner, Mr. Durchslag possesses more than 20 years of experience in the technology industry and has served technology clients in the U.S., Greater China and South Asia. He is one of the youngest partners ever elected at McKinsey, achieving this distinction in only four years. Mr. Durchslag graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago and received a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School. We believe Mr. Durchslag is qualified to serve on our Board due to his strategic and managerial experience as well as his in-depth knowledge of the Company's business and operations.

September 08, 2015 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Angie’s List (NASDAQ:ANGI) today announced that Scott Durchslag has been 
      appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the 
      company’s Board of Directors, effective September 8, 2015.
    


      Mr. Durchslag is a proven executive with more than 20 years of 
      experience leading e-commerce and technology businesses at companies 
      serving both consumers and businesses. He joins Angie’s List having most 
      recently served as President, Global e-Commerce and Marketing at Best 
      Buy. In that role, held until last year, he led the transformation of 
      the company's global e-commerce business and was responsible for a $3 
      billion P&L. He also had responsibility for developing Best Buy’s retail 
      multichannel experience, the My Best Buy credit card/loyalty program and 
      corporate-wide marketing initiatives. During his tenure, Best Buy 
      accelerated online revenue growth from 11% in the fiscal fourth quarter 
      of 2013 to 26% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 and improved 
      customer satisfaction scores, while moving to a new integrated 
      multichannel platform. He enhanced marketing effectiveness by increasing 
      digital’s share of the marketing mix, better using more digital 
      channels, optimizing organic search and deploying new software and tools.
    

      Prior to joining Best Buy, Mr. Durchslag was President of Expedia 
      Worldwide, a leading global online travel agency where he was 
      responsible for managing the overall strategy, product development, 
      marketing and operations of its 27 sites around the world with a focus 
      on increasing Expedia’s global footprint and driving innovation to gain 
      share. During his tenure, he launched the Expedia 3.0 turnaround 
      strategy that reignited product innovation, including introducing a new 
      platform which has been a significant contributor to the company’s 
      growth. Previously, Mr. Durchslag was Chief Operating Officer at Skype 
      Global S.à r.l., a worldwide provider of software and mobile 
      communications services. Under his leadership as COO, the company 
      introduced new products and services, including Skype for Mac, Skype’s 
      first mobile products and Skype for Business. During his tenure, Mr. 
      Durchslag oversaw substantial growth in registered users, which 
      increased from 217 million at the beginning of 2008 to 474 million by 
      the end of 2009, and revenues doubled from an annualized run rate of 
      $400 million to $800 million.
    

      “Scott is an action oriented executive who understands how to leverage 
      technology platforms to engage consumers and drive profitable growth,” 
      said Angie’s List Chairman John Chuang. “His experience in operations, 
      marketing, product development and engineering makes him particularly 
      well-suited to lead Angie’s List as we work to fortify our position as a 
      leading platform in the $800 billion local services marketplace.”
    

      Mr. Chuang continued, “The company conducted an extensive CEO search and 
      interviewed a number of highly qualified candidates. Scott distinguished 
      himself as our top choice, having the broad range of experience and 
      skills with both consumers and technology that we believe will take the 
      company into its next phase of growth and value creation.”
    

      “I am thrilled to be joining Angie’s List,” Mr. Durchslag said. “The 
      company has set the bar for delivering a great local services experience 
      for consumers and service providers alike. Now it’s time to raise that 
      bar, and I’m confident that we will. Angie’s List benefits from a highly 
      recognized brand, strong value proposition, extensive data and 
      reputation for quality. These differentiators have enabled Angie’s List 
      to grow quickly and establish a sizeable, loyal base of customers and 
      service providers. I am excited by the opportunity to build upon the 
      company’s strong foundation and accelerate its success.”

      marketing and customer care. At Motorola, he was also part of the team 
      that enabled Motorola's market share to double, launched its then 
      leading RAZR product and created strategic partnerships with other 
      technology leaders, including Google and Microsoft. Earlier, Mr. 
      Durchslag worked at software startups in Silicon Valley, one of which 
      was Grand Central Networks which was later purchased by Google.
    

      A former McKinsey & Company partner, Mr. Durchslag has more than 20 
      years in the technology industry and has served technology clients in 
      the U.S., Greater China and South Asia. He is one of the youngest

Industry Q&A: Scott Durchslag, Angie's List

	Angie’s List recently launched LeadFeed, a new service aimed at converting visitors who do not have an account with the website into new leads for service providers. We spoke with Scott Durchslag, Angie’s List president and CEO, about the new offering.


	First, how did LeadFeed come about?

Durchslag: LeadFeed came into being when I first came to Angie’s List and looked at our analytics information. Each year we have more than 100 million unique visitors, but 85 percent of them are not members. So they were coming to the site then leaving, and we weren’t doing anything with them.

	The thought behind LeadFeed was a very simple one. Why not ask these non-members what it is they were looking for and how urgently they needed it? By answering those questions, they become a new source of leads for our service providers.
	 

	Can you tell us a little more about what visitors to the site would be filling out?

Durchslag: In its essence, we ask the person to select what category of work they want to get done. We have them tell us a little more about the job and get some indication of its urgency. We then pass that information on to our qualified service providers, and that person’s mobile phone will be ringing pretty quickly.
	 

	In a release announcing the new program, your company stated that LeadFeed will initially be offered in “approximately 25 categories.” Is flooring one of those categories?

Durchslag: Yes, it is. I’m excited about this category particularly. It’s one of those areas where, when you have the need, you want to make sure the person who is going to come into your home understands the right products and the right look. Flooring is not a “quick fix,” but requires experts who can react quickly. So I think the LeadFeed program lends itself particularly well to this category.


	If visitors to your site can be routed to providers through this program, what is their incentive to become members?

Durchslag: There are a lot of benefits to membership. Members can see all of the reviews posted. They’ll be covered by the Fair Price Guarantee and Service Quality Guarantee. We also find that once visitors to the site have a positive experience with one of our service providers, they usually become members.


	Anything else you’d like to add?

Durchslag: The LeadFeed program is us looking at different ways to make our service available to non-members because we get so many of them, while also being a big benefit to our service providers. Service providers will pay per lead, along with a platform fee of $499 per year, or $49.99 a month for those who want to get that experience at a lower initial cost. A background check is also required.
