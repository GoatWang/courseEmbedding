				Floating Rate Fund

Investor Class
PRFRX

Invests primarily in institutional floating-rate bank loans and other floating-rate debt securities with below investment-grade credit ratings. Broadly diversified across 125–150 credit facilities, with strict exposure limits to manage risk. 
The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds. This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

Benefits & Risks
The floating-rate feature virtually eliminates interest rate risk.Bank loans typically rank higher in the capital structure for repayment.Low historical return correlations with other asset classes, including high-yield bonds, make bank loans a diversifier for equity and fixed-income portfolios.The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds.This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.



Investor Profile
Suitable for an investor seeking high levels of current income.Appropriate for an investor seeking the diversification benefits that high-yield securities offer equity and investment-grade bond portfolios.

Sources for Fund Credit Quality Diversification: Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's (S&P); split ratings (i.e. BB/B and B/CCC) are assigned when the Moody's and S&P ratings differ. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency. Short-Term holdings are not rated. Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets. 







The source of credit quality for the S&P/LSTA Performance Loan Index is Standard & Poor's.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

				Real Estate Fund

Investor Class
TRREX

Invests at least 80% in the equity of securities of companies that derive at least 50% of revenue or profits from, or commit at least 50% of assets to, real estate activities. The fund is likely to maintain a significant portion of assets in real estate investment trusts (REITs).
Narrow sector focus entails more volatility than funds with a broader scope. As with all stock funds, this fund’s share price can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a particular industry, or specific holdings.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 1.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Investment Objective
The fund seeks to provide long-term growth through a combination of capital appreciation and current income.
Strategy
To invest at least 80% of net assets in the equity securities of real estate companies. The fund's definition of real estate companies is broad and includes those with a minimum of 50% of revenues or profits derived from, or assets committed to, real estate activities. Up to 20% of fund assets may be invested in companies deriving a substantial portion of revenues or profits from servicing real estate firms, as well as in companies unrelated to the real estate business. The fund can invest up to 25% of its total assets in foreign securities.







							Risk/Reward Potential**
						


						Click on the risk/reward spectrum below to view the funds in that category
					









Higher
Moderate
Lower






















This fund offers long-term capital growth potential through a combination of appreciation and current income. This fund is widely diversified within the real estate universe and could complement a stock and bond portfolio because real estate does not closely track the performance of the broad markets. The fund also invests in many companies that pay dividends, which are always a positive component of total return.Due to its concentration in the real estate industry, the fund�s share price could be more volatile than that of a fund with a broader investment mandate. Trends perceived to be unfavorable to real estate, such as changes in the tax laws or rising interest rates, could cause a decline in share prices.

					**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.

Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis.  A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. 
If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. 
When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.


Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.

When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.

All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.  Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk.  Please consult the funds' prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds' risks.

				Real Estate Fund - I Class

I Class
TIRRX

Invests at least 80% in the equity of securities of companies that derive at least 50% of revenue or profits from, or commit at least 50% of assets to, real estate activities. The fund is likely to maintain a significant portion of assets in real estate investment trusts (REITs).
Narrow sector focus entails more volatility than funds with a broader scope. As with all stock funds, this fund’s share price can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a particular industry, or specific holdings.

*Ratings displayed with hollow stars represent Morningstar Extended Performance Ratings.  Morningstar provides adjusted historical returns and an Extended Performance Rating for some mutual fund share class that don't have a 1, 3-, 5-, or 10-year performance history.  These hypothetical Morningstar Ratings are based on the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted for fees and expenses.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







*The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, The I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 1.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

   Source   for performance: T. Rowe Price. Fund performance is calculated using the   official NAV with dividends reinvested, if any. The value of an investment   and any income from it can go down as well as up. Investors may get back less   than the amount invested. It will be affected by changes in the exchange rate   between the base currency of the fund and the subscription currency, if   different. Sales charges (up to a maximum of 5% for the A Class), taxes and   other locally applied costs have not been deducted and if applicable, they   will reduce the performance figures. Past   performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

Hedged share classes (denoted by 'h') utilise investment techniques to mitigate currency risk between the underlying investment currency(ies) of the fund and the currency of the hedged share class. The costs of doing so will be borne by the share class and there is no guarantee that such hedging will be effective.






   Please   note that no management fees are charged to the Z, S and J share classes. No   administration agent fees are charged to the J class. No expenses or any   other fees are charged to the Z class. Fee arrangements for the Z, S and J   classes are made directly with the investment manager. Please see the   prospectus for further information.



   Where   the base currency of the fund differs from the share class currency, exchange   rate movements may affect returns.

The portfolio recorded strong gains in July. Helped by a recovery in Paris office real estate, our overweight position and holdings in France made the largest contribution to relative performance. Stock selection in the U.S. also added good value. A New York City office REIT, which benefited from improved property revenue during the second quarter, was chief among the contributors here. Having no exposure to Germany weighed on relative performance meanwhile. We largely avoid Germany as much of the country’s publicly-listed real estate is residential-focused and we have a preference for investments in commercial real estate.

We invest primarily in developed markets and seek to have broad geographic exposure while avoiding large country bets. We are diversified across property types, although given our bottom-up approach, we may be over- or underweight particular subsectors at any given time. We believe that high-quality assets in high-barrier-to-entry markets run by skilled management teams drive superior performance within the real estate space over the long term. Because real estate cycles occur over long periods, we employ a long-term orientation to allow for the compounding of value for our clients. We believe that fundamental research is the key to identifying attractive long-term risk/reward opportunities.United States The largest absolute weight in the portfolio and benchmark is in the United States, the largest and most mature market within commercial real estate. In the U.S., leasing pipelines remain active, and occupancy rates and rents are increasing in many markets across a range of property types. We believe that commercial real estate should benefit from constrained new supply in conjunction with moderate demand growth. We hold a diverse range of U.S. commercial real estate companies, with our largest allocations in regional mall companies Simon Property Group and General Growth Properties, and apartment REIT AvalonBay Communities. Simon Property Group is the largest REIT and maintains a dominant U.S. mall portfolio. High barriers to entry, network effect advantages, long-term leases, and high occupancy rates have combined to produce robust and predictable cash flows. The company has a strong management team that has skillfully reinvested cash flow. During the quarter, we added to Equity Residential, the largest publicly traded apartment REIT in the U.S. The company's holdings have evolved into a portfolio of high-quality bi-coastal assets with an urban focus. We also added to lodging REIT Sunstone Hotel Investors, which owns a focused portfolio of hotels located in urban areas, Urban Edge Properties, which owns necessity-oriented shopping centers mainly concentrated in the northeast U.S., and Boston Properties, which owns office properties in leading urban markets. We trimmed Federal Realty Investment Trust, an owner of shopping centers in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, on strength. We also reduced Douglas Emmett, which owns office and multifamily properties in California and Hawaii.Japan We have a significant weighting in Japan, where we believe our holdings are well positioned to benefit from economic recovery and a reversal of deflationary pressures. Our largest holding is Mitsui Fudosan, which manages numerous office, housing, and retail properties throughout Japan. The company appears well positioned for cash flow growth in a recovery. We also have a sizable position in Mitsubishi Estate, which develops and manages a portfolio located in primarily high-barrier markets. The company owns a substantial concentration of assets in the Marunouchi district in Japan adjacent to the Imperial Palace. During the period we added to Mori Hills, which owns office assets within Central Tokyo. We believe the planned acquisition of sponsor company Mori Buildings' pipeline should support external growth. We eliminated our position in Invincible Investment, a lodging J-REIT, on strength.Hong Kong We also maintain a substantial weighting in Hong Kong, where we focus our efforts on those companies with high-quality properties in attractive locations. The lack of available land for commercial and residential construction should benefit operating fundamentals over the long run. Our largest exposure is to Cheung Kong Property Holdings, which owns well-located office buildings in Central Hong Kong, as well as a low-cost land bank for residential use, and an attractive hotel portfolio. We also hold positions in Hongkong Land Holdings and Wharf Holdings.Australia We have a significant weighting to Australia, where we focus on companies benefiting from a solid retail environment, driven by low oil prices, low interest rates, and a surge in tourism. Our largest exposure is to Scentre Group, which owns, operates and develops a portfolio of Westfield-branded shopping centers in Australia. We believe the company owns great retail assets in the best locations and should benefit from its strong management team and favorable retail environment. We also hold a position in Vicinity Centres, which also owns various shopping centers in Australia.Additional AllocationsAdditional weightings include France and the United Kingdom. During the period we purchased UNITE, the largest owner and developer of student accommodations in the U.K. With an improving balance sheet and high-quality assets in supply-constrained locations, we view UNITE as a secular growth opportunity. We added to Great Portland Estates, which redevelops office assets in London's supply-constrained West End. We sold U.K.-based Hammerson, a retail property owner. In France, we added to Klepierre, which owns shopping center properties throughout continental Europe.

Investments in the U.S. continue to dominate the portfolio, accounting for around half of the Fund’s country allocation. Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, France, and the UK are also significantly represented. During the month, we continued to add to investments where we feel valuations underestimate the durability of growth or turnaround potential within a company. These were in varied segments and countries, including two multifamily residential REITs in the U.S., a student housing real estate developer in the UK, and a regional mall REIT in the U.S.

	    Nina Jones,
	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



AvalonBay Communities, which holds apartment properties, dipped during the period, as decelerating rent growth fueled concerns around new supply deliveries. We believe the company's competitively-advantaged development franchise, combined with a well-located portfolio of multi-family assets, excellent management team, and solid balance sheet should allow it to grow per-share value faster than its peers over the cycle.Shares of Great Portland Estates and Derwent London declined following the Brexit referendum. We used the share decline to add to both companies, as they own prime West End London office real estate, have good management teams, and solid balance sheets. While there is real risk to property values in London, we believe that the market's current haircut represents an attractive entry point. Given the increased uncertainty, however, we are likely to add slowly over time.Iguatemi Empresa de Shopping Centers remained on an upward path. We believe the stock offers exposure to a high-quality portfolio of shopping malls with a significant concentration in São Paulo.Nippon Accommodations Fund is the second largest residential REIT in Japan, with properties primarily in central Tokyo. Shares moved up early in the period, as the company's ability to increase rents within its portfolio has begun to strengthen.

	    David J. Eiswert,
	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



We expect the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a slow but steady pace. If President Trump is able to move ahead with tax reform and is successful in getting some of his proposed infrastructure stimulus through Congress, we think inflationary factors could drive markets higher. However, if the agenda stalls, secular stagnation could persist. Ultimately, we want our investments to work regardless of the broader external environment and will continue to buy quality companies where we have specific insights that should lead to improving economic returns in the future.

Diverse economic and corporate fundamentals across regions, countries, and sectors have led to increased complexity and volatility in equity markets. While this presents challenges for most investors looking for clear winners, we feel we have a significant advantage through our fundamental analysis, sound analytical framework, and focus on durable and high-quality growth companies.

We believe the market is approaching a new long-term average for the price of oil in the $40 to $50 per barrel range, despite the higher price levels that many market participants expect. We are heartened that opportunities for new investments remain, in part driven by the volatility in the space.

Emerging Markets Equity

In emerging markets, identifying winners can be profitable; but avoiding losers is critical. Investing in the region since 1985, we believe there is no substitute for proprietary, fundamentally-driven research. That’s why today we have one of the industry’s deepest emerging and frontier markets equity research platforms.

The high yield market has enjoyed a significant rally in recent months. However, ongoing macro factors and negative headlines will likely cause volatility in risk assets, including high yield bonds. Our estimates for fallen angels - issuers downgraded from investment-grade to high yield - have been nearly met and absorbed into the market, but energy and metals issuers will continue to drive the market default rate higher through 2016 into 2017.

We believe the start of the European Central Bank's (ECB) corporate bond buying programme in June is likely to be a near-term focus for the asset class. More broadly, upcoming risk events, such as the UK's referendum on European Union membership could cause volatility to rise across financial markets, which could feed through into investment-grade corporate bonds. That said, we believe that from a medium-term perspective, fundamentals in the asset class are reasonable as Europe is in a credit-friendly part of the economic cycle with inflation low and growth moderate.

While we are reasonably sanguine about the outlook for the market, we retain a defensive bias. We suspect that, at current spreads, the market is already pricing in much of the European Central Bank's (ECB) bond buying programme. Although further gains are unlikely to be as strong as April’s, we believe there will be some limitation of downside risk as long as the ECB continues to fuel demand for yield.

We believe that long-term fundamental drivers in emerging markets debt remain sound, with solid sovereign balance sheets and higher growth profiles relative to developed markets. Furthermore, from a relative value perspective, yields are more attractive in emerging market local debt than developed markets where a growing number of securities are trading with negative yields.

The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is

				Global Real Estate Fund

Investor Class
TRGRX

Invests primarily in stocks of real estate companies throughout the world, providing exposure in at least five different countries, including the United States. 
Changes in tax or zoning laws, overbuilding, environmental issues, changes in interest rates, the quality of property management (REITs), and other factors could hurt the fund. Real estate is affected by general economic conditions. When growth is slowing, demand for property decreases and prices may decline. Rising interest rates, which drive up mortgage and financing costs, can restrain construction and buying and selling activity and may reduce the appeal of real estate investments. Since the fund can invest substantially in foreign securities, it will also be subject to the risks inherent in non-U.S. issues.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

				Floating Rate Fund

Investor Class
PRFRX

Invests primarily in institutional floating-rate bank loans and other floating-rate debt securities with below investment-grade credit ratings. Broadly diversified across 125–150 credit facilities, with strict exposure limits to manage risk. 
The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds. This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

Benefits & Risks
The floating-rate feature virtually eliminates interest rate risk.Bank loans typically rank higher in the capital structure for repayment.Low historical return correlations with other asset classes, including high-yield bonds, make bank loans a diversifier for equity and fixed-income portfolios.The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds.This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.



Investor Profile
Suitable for an investor seeking high levels of current income.Appropriate for an investor seeking the diversification benefits that high-yield securities offer equity and investment-grade bond portfolios.

Benchmark: S&P/LSTA Performing Loan Index




Sources for Fund Credit Quality Diversification: Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's (S&P); split ratings (i.e. BB/B and B/CCC) are assigned when the Moody's and S&P ratings differ. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency. Short-Term holdings are not rated. Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets. 







The source of credit quality for the S&P/LSTA Performance Loan Index is Standard & Poor's.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.

Workers Compensation 


State Fund and All Workers Compensation Carriers


Who needs Workers Compensation Coverage?
California law requires employers to have Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Even out-of-state employers may need Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage if an employee is regularly employed in California or a contract of employment is entered into here. All California employers must provide Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits to their employees under California Labor Code Section 3700. There are five basic types of Workers’ Compensation Insurance benefits – medical care, temporary disability benefits, permanent disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation services, and death benefits. In California, all employers, whether large or small, are required to have coverage for their employees with Workers’ Compensation Insurance. An employee does not have to be full-time, or employed by only one employer for any number of months or days. In addition, there is no need for a written employment contract and employees can include legal and illegal aliens, minors and prisoners. Under certain circumstances; i.e., a home owner, you may be required to have workers’ compensation if you hire someone to perform gardening, maintenance, house cleaning, etc.


What does a Workers Compensation Policy Cover?
Workers’ Compensation coverage is offered under Part One of a Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy. In Part one, the insurance company agrees to promptly pay all benefits and compensation due to an injured worker. Employers Liability insurance can provide important coverage in addition to Workers’ Compensation Insurance. Employers Liability is offered under Part Two of a Workers’ Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance policy. Employers Liability Part Two protects the employer against instances where an employee’s injury or disease is not considered work related.


Who’s exempt from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Only corporate officers or limited liability company (LLC) owners in the construction industry with at least a 10 percent stock ownership in the corporation or LLC can elect to exempt themselves from Workers’ Compensation coverage. No more than three per corporation or LLC are allowed to be exempt. This new law will curb the tide of costly and dangerous practices by those construction employers looking to make a fast buck, while exposing employees and consumers to financial and physical harm.


Can a sole proprietor or individual exempt themselves from Workers Compensation Insurance?
Sole Proprietors and partners are not required to cover themselves, but can elect to be covered. Corporate officers are covered but those who own at least 10% of the corporation’s stock may elect to be exempted from coverage. If you work for yourself or own a business, you may not be required to carry Workers’ Compensation Insurance coverage. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under a policy. If, the employer hires employees, the employees must be covered even if the owner is not. Sole proprietors, partners, and officers of closely held corporations are generally not considered employees unless specifically listed under the business Workers’ Compensation Insurance policy.


What do you consider a Sub-Contractor or Independent Contractor vs. an employee?
Independent contractors and subcontractors are considered employees of their clients unless they meet certain very specific criteria for independence and both parties have their own Work Comp Policies.
