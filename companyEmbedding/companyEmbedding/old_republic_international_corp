Old Republic International Corporation

























 
							





Old Republic manages its business through some 134
                        corporate entities, of which 27 are insurance
                        subsidiaries covering all 50 states, three US territories, and all ten Canadian providences. Old
                        Republic's companies market, underwrite, and provide
                        risk management services for a multitude of coverages,
                        predominantly in the general (property and casualty)
                        and title insurance arenas. A small
                        life and accident insurance business is also conducted in
                        the U.S. and Canada, principally as an adjunct to the
                        Company's general insurance operations. The
                        breadth of coverages ensures wide diversification and
                        dispersion of risks. Additionally, Old Republic's
                        companies focus only on carefully selected major sectors
                        of the American economy that are not uniformly exposed
                        to the same business cycles. Old Republic operates in a
                        decentralized manner that emphasizes specialization by
                        type of insurance coverage, as well as industries and
                        economic sectors served.
Old Republic publishes an Annual Review that is
                        widely distributed to agents, brokers, customers,
                        employees, and others interested in the Company's
                        business objectives and product offerings. The most
                        current Annual Review is downloadable in the Investors
                        section of this Website.
Old Republic's business segments are
                        described below.





»
							
							Old Republic General Insurance Group






This group of companies is the largest of Old
                        Republic's business segments. It offers a wide variety
                        of property and casualty insurance coverages and
                        related services, predominantly to commercial customers. The majority of coverages are
                        liability and workers compensation insurance products.
                        Old Republic does not have significant exposure to
                        property types of coverages. The predominant share of the General
                        Insurance Group's business is produced through independent
                        agency and brokerage channels.
 

                        The following chart reflects the Old Republic General Insurance
                        Group's sources of premium volume distributed among the major sectors of the American economy it serves.


















                        Old Republic's major subsidiary operating centers are listed
                        below together with their main areas of focus. The
                        percentage included parenthetically after each operating
                        company's name indicates its approximate contribution to
                        the General Insurance Group's current gross premium
                        volume. The letters shown parenthetically after each
                        company's name represent the most recent
                        financial ratings awarded by independent agencies in the
                        following order: A. M. Best, Moody's, and
                        Standard & Poor's. A dash (-) in the ordered space
                        indicates that the rating agency in question either does not
                        rate the particular Old Republic company, or that such
                        company has not sought a rating.  Where groups are referenced,
                        the ratings provided pertain to the primary risk bearing insurers
                        within that underwriting operation.

                        underwritten consist of workers' compensation,
                        commercial automobile, general liability, and commercial
                        multi-peril. Independent agents produce most of BITCO
                        business volume.

Old Republic manages its business through some 134
                        corporate entities, of which 27 are insurance
                        subsidiaries covering all 50 states, three US territories, and all ten Canadian providences. Old
                        Republic's companies market, underwrite, and provide
                        risk management services for a multitude of coverages,
                        predominantly in the general (property and casualty)
                        and title insurance arenas. A small
                        life and accident insurance business is also conducted in
                        the U.S. and Canada, principally as an adjunct to the
                        Company's general insurance operations. The
                        breadth of coverages ensures wide diversification and
                        dispersion of risks. Additionally, Old Republic's
                        companies focus only on carefully selected major sectors
                        of the American economy that are not uniformly exposed
                        to the same business cycles. Old Republic operates in a
                        decentralized manner that emphasizes specialization by
                        type of insurance coverage, as well as industries and
                        economic sectors served.
Old Republic publishes an Annual Review that is
                        widely distributed to agents, brokers, customers,
                        employees, and others interested in the Company's
                        business objectives and product offerings. The most
                        current Annual Review is downloadable in the Investors
                        section of this Website.
Old Republic's business segments are
                        described below.





»
							
							Old Republic General Insurance Group






This group of companies is the largest of Old
                        Republic's business segments. It offers a wide variety
                        of property and casualty insurance coverages and
                        related services, predominantly to commercial customers. The majority of coverages are
                        liability and workers compensation insurance products.
                        Old Republic does not have significant exposure to
                        property types of coverages. The predominant share of the General
                        Insurance Group's business is produced through independent
                        agency and brokerage channels.
 

                        The following chart reflects the Old Republic General Insurance
                        Group's sources of premium volume distributed among the major sectors of the American economy it serves.


















                        Old Republic's major subsidiary operating centers are listed
                        below together with their main areas of focus. The
                        percentage included parenthetically after each operating
                        company's name indicates its approximate contribution to
                        the General Insurance Group's current gross premium
                        volume. The letters shown parenthetically after each
                        company's name represent the most recent
                        financial ratings awarded by independent agencies in the
                        following order: A. M. Best, Moody's, and
                        Standard & Poor's. A dash (-) in the ordered space
                        indicates that the rating agency in question either does not
                        rate the particular Old Republic company, or that such
                        company has not sought a rating.  Where groups are referenced,
                        the ratings provided pertain to the primary risk bearing insurers
                        within that underwriting operation.

                        underwritten consist of workers' compensation,
                        commercial automobile, general liability, and commercial
                        multi-peril. Independent agents produce most of BITCO

                        targeted growth through a specialized agency force.

What Home Warranty Has To Offer To A HomeownerYou just purchased your dream house along with the all the perfect décor that turns your dream house into your dream home. It has been a few months and everything is unpacked and placed in their designated spot within your new home. So you turn your attention to rebuilding your savings account since it was depleted from the biggest and most important purchase of your life. However, within a few months of living in your dream home you experience a quite costly unexpected expense when your heater grows out during the winter.With a new mortgage payment and a limited amount in savings, you are looking at numerous financial options on how to pay for this unexpected expense. Fortunately, you purchased a home protection plan that will cover this expense as well as any major systems and appliances that may need repair or replacement in your home.What Does a Home Warranty Include?Home warranties typically include coverage the following major appliances and systems: • Central Air Conditioning Systems • Central Heating Systems • Humidifiers • Interior Electrical Systems • Refrigerators • Ranges, Ovens, and Cooktops • Dishwashers • Built-In Microwaves • Water Heaters • Plumbing Systems  • Garbage Disposals • Washers and Dryers • Garage Door Openers • Roof LeaksWhen Do You Need A Home Warranty?Home warranties are offered to all homeowners whether they are new or existing. Typically, home warranty plans are offered to the home-buyer when they are purchasing a new home. However, if the buyer decides not to purchase home warranty insurance simultaneously with their home purchase, then they can secure a home protection plan at a later date. There is not time restricts as to when a homeowner can decide to purchase a warranty plan.Cost Involved with a Warranty For Your HomeTypically, a home warranty cost a couple hundred dollars, which can be paid in a lump sum amount during the purchase of a new home. This lump sum payment would be collected at the time closing costs are due for their newly purchased home. However, the seller of the home, real estate agent or a family member or friend can purchase home warranties on behalf of a home-buyer. If a home appliance insurance claim is filed then the homeowner may be responsible for paying a service fee or deductible that typically ranges from $50 to $100.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
