UFP Technologies' applications include custom components, products, commodity packaging, and specialty packaging primarily for the medical, automotive, aerospace, defense, electronics, consumer, and industrial markets.. The manufacturing division uses a variety of materials, such as foam (cross-linked polyethylene, reticulated, melamine, specialty foam), woven and non-woven fabric, molded pulp, plastics (rigid, rubber, corrugated), natural fibers, films and adhesives.[4]
The Company has also developed a line of standard products that are trademarked and branded, including:

FlexShield - Medical device pouch for protecting small instruments and tools[5]
BioShell - Pharmaceutical bag protection system[6]
T-Tubes - Tube and pipe insulation for clean room environments[6]
Tri-Covers - Prevent particle migration and provide impact cushioning for stainless steel ends[7]
Controlclean - Absorbent wipes used to clean surfaces within controlled environments [8]
Wine Packs - Wine shipping solutions made from molded fiber[6]
Pro-Sticks - Sanitary solution for nail care services [6]

In 2014, UFP Technologies developed a customizable insulated shipping container for its BioShell Suspension Pack for protecting single-use biopharmaceutical bags during storage, handling, and shipping.[9]
Corporate History[edit]
UFP Technologies, formerly known as United Packaging Corporation, was founded in 1963 by William H. Shaw, Robert W. Drew, and Richard L. Bailly in Woburn, MA. Within one year the company expanded operations and moved its factory headquarters to Georgetown, MA. In 1967, the company changed its name to United Foam Plastics Corporation to reflect a broader market capability. On December 17, 1993 the company completed its initial public offering and formally changed its name to UFP Technologies, Inc.[10][11]
Awards[edit]
UFP Technologies was named to the Fortune Small Business 100 list of the fastest-growing, publicly held small companies in the U.S. in 2009 and 2008, with a rank of 47th and 75th, respectively.[12][13]
UFP Technologies was named to the Forbes 100 Best Small Companies in America in 2011 and 2010 with the rank of No. 64 and No. 12, respectively.[14][15]

In 1993, the Company acquired Moulded Fibre Technologies, which focused on recycling old newspapers into molded fiber packaging for light industrial goods, electronics, and health and beauty products.[17][18]
On February 4, 1997, UFP Technologies acquired the assets of FCE Industries Inc., formerly known as Foam Cutting Engineers, a supplier of foam plastics for industrial and consumer applications.[19]
UFP Technologies acquired Pacific Foam Inc., a producer of specialty foam products for the health and beauty industry, in December 1998.[20]
In 2000, UFP Technologies acquired Simco Industries Inc., a full-service supplier of automotive trim components.[21]
UFP Technologies acquired three companies in 2009: Advanced Materials Group, a foam fabricator based in Rancho Dominguez, California,[22] Foamade Industries Inc., a manufacturer of foam products and industrial machinery[23] and E.N. Murray, a designer, converter, and distributor of foam plastic products, specializing in technical polyurethane foams.[24]
In January 2013, UFP Technologies acquired Packaging Alternatives Corporation, a full service designer, converter, and distributor of foam plastic products, specializing in technical polyurethane foams principally for the medical market.[25]
Investments[edit]
In September 2013, UFP Technologies spent approximately $550,000 to build its sixth clean room, aiming to expand further into the medical device field.[26][27]
In August 2014, UFP Technologies expanded its Georgetown, Mass., operation with the addition of a clean room and high volume equipment to support the production of components made from medical grade thermoplastic polyurethane.[28]
UFP Technologies expanded its North American operations for molded fiber packaging with a new location in El Paso, Texas in November 2014.[29]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Foam



Foam: Polyethylene, Polyurethane & Specialty Materials


As one of the largest foam fabricators in North America, UFP Technologies has access to materials from the top suppliers from across the globe. We act as an extension of your in-house research, engineering and manufacturing teams, collaborating with you to determine the best materials for your application.
Choosing the proper foam material for your packaging or component product can be a very challenging task. Not only do different foams have varying cell structures and characteristics, but foams from the same material family can also be made with vastly different density and firmness specifications that will greatly affect their performance. We'll work with you to determine the characteristics you need to make your component, packaging or product successful.
UFP Technologies has access to an array of polyethylene foams, cross-linked polyethylene foams, polyurethane foams, reticulated polyurethane foams, and specialty foams:
Polyethylene
From packaging fragile electronics to providing comfort and support for sporting goods, polyethylene foam offers the durable, lightweight, closed-cell characteristics you need. It combines excellent vibration dampening and insulation properties with high resistance to chemicals and moisture. Because cross-linked polyethylene adds the ability to protect Class "A" surfaces, it is often used in the packaging of medical devices and equipment.
Polyurethane
This popular family of foams is ideal for a broad range of applications, from liquid delivery in a medical device, to air filtration in a lawn mower, to sound management in automobiles. Polyurethane foam is a resilient open-celled material which offers superior cushioning and protection properties. Specialty controlled porosity sized foams can be reticulated offering higher tensile, tear, and elongation characteristics.
Specialty Foams
There's virtually no limit to the types of specialty materials we work with, or the creative ways we combine them to deliver the qualities you need - anti-static, breathable, conductive, hydrophilic, static-dissipative, and more. Whether it's a high-performance application or a relatively simple one, we'll identify the right material for the job.
