Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Are We Right For you? 































We build and manage diversified equity and fixed income strategies which are suitable for clients of varying age, risk tolerance, objectives and liquidity. All strategies revolve around the selection of securities based on our research and analysis of individual companies, industries, and long-term social, demographic and economic trends. By contrast, an increasing number of firms pursue market-exposure based strategies --- asset allocation models using "bundled" securities such as ETF's or other structured synthetic securities; such models tend to be built on backward-looking analysis and may involve risks that are less clear than for individual securities. Our approach is based on certain beliefs:  

Using primarily individual, unbundled securities is an important aspect of controlling risk and achieving the best potential return for a given level of risk. 
As an equity investor, understanding your risk tolerance in advance is essential because individual stocks and equity account values can fluctuate substantially as prices react or over-react to temporary changes in the business and economic outlook, and to intangibles such as market confidence, investor perception and emotional bias. 
Over a long period of time, intangibles have minimal impact while investment returns primarily reflect the success and value of the underlying businesses in relation to purchase price. 
Owning businesses that are managed for the long-term financial success of their shareholders, are competitively well-positioned in their industry and provide products and services for which demand is sustainable and growing is an enduring strategy to achieve long-term investment results.

 Career History



Operations Manager

                                    Current                


Messner & Smith Theme Value Investment Management Ltd.


                  MSIM pursues a value based investment philosophy based on the belief that superior equity investments are those whose current market valuations do not reflect adequately the present or future operating potential of the underlying business. They believe that mid- and small-cap companies represent ground that is more fertile because they generally receive less Wall Street attention.The firm's non-linear investment identification process and their fundamental research have 8 phases, all of which are executed for every company on the firm's buy and candidate lists. These phases are: idea generation, 'incubation' period on candidate list or elimination from consideration, fundamental balance sheet and accounting analysis, identification of a niche product or process to drive earnings, contact with company management, competitors and suppliers, strategic analysis to assess market, industry, company and portfolio risk, analysis of liquidity/trading patterns and position on buy list for purchase across all relevant strategy portfolios.A number of proprietary screens are used. Examples of screening criteria are price movement, price-to-book, limited institutional ownership, limited Wall Street coverage and positive cash flow.MSIM portfolios are managed on a team basis and formal committee meetings are held weekly or more often when warranted. Additionally, committee members interact daily, digesting, analyzing and discussing market and company specific information. When a company gains a position on the buy list, all committee members' radar is alerted with regard to direct or inferential information that might affect the company's business or its stock performance.Once an investment decision has been made by the committee, a specific price or price range is established based on internally developed models/forecasts.  Having identified a good business and reached a consensus on its merits, the firm has the patience to wait for their price, and constantly monitor the balance or risk and reward relative to industry, market and economic conditions.MSIM's sell discipline includes both absolute and relative measurements. Holdings are trimmed, reevaluated or sold as they approach or reach their target price. In addition, holdings may be sold (or reduced) should they become overvalued in relation to their peers. Positions may be sold in order to accommodate a new investment if the investment committee believes the new investment has greater potential. Finally, stocks are sold when a company fails to meet the firm's investment expectations, the initial investment thesis has changed or there are unanticipated negative events, including management credibility issues.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
