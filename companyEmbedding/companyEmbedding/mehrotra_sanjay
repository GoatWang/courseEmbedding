FAQs
Q. Why was the search for a new CEO initiated? 
A.  Mark Durcan had discussed with the board of directors his desire to retire from Micron when the time and conditions were right for the company. As a result, the board formed a special committee to oversee the selection process for the position of CEO and, with the assistance of a leading global executive search firm, initiated a search to identify and vet candidates.
 Q.  Why was Sanjay Mehrotra chosen? What strengths does he bring to Micron?
A.  Sanjay Mehrotra was selected because his track record of business success, exceptional knowledge of the memory and storage industry and experience in markets ranging from consumer to enterprise make him uniquely qualified to lead Micron into the future. As a co-founder of SanDisk, Mehrotra led the company from start-up in 1988 until its eventual sale in 2016. Additionally, he served as SanDisk’s president and CEO from 2011 to 2016.   
Q.  What is the timing of the transition? Will there be overlap between Durcan and Mehrotra?
A.  The board of directors has announced that Mehrotra will join Micron effective May 8 as the new president and CEO. Durcan will step down as CEO and from the Micron board of directors on May 8, but he will continue in an advisory role until early August to ensure a seamless and effective transition.

A.  Yes, Mehrotra will join the Micron board of directors effective May 8.  

Q.   Do you anticipate major changes in direction for Micron with the new leader?

The board continually evaluates the company’s strategy in light of the competitive landscape. By implementing a long-term succession plan, the board aims to ensure a smooth transition and position Micron for continued success in the future. 

Q.   Where will Mehrotra be located? Will Micron’s headquarters remain in Boise?

In February, Micron CEO Mark Durcan announced his retirement after three decades with the company. Durcan had previously announced plans to retire in 2012 while serving as the company's president, but the death of then-CEO Steve Appleton prompted Durcan to postpone his retirement indefinitely to serve as Micron's CEO. Micron's board of directors has now selected Sanjay Mehrotra to be the new president and CEO of Micron. Durcan will step down and be replaced by Mehrotra effective May 8, 2017.

Mehrotra's background includes co-founding SanDisk in 1988 and serving as its president and CEO from 2011 until its acquisition in 2016 by Western Digital. Prior to serving as CEO of SanDisk, Mehrotra had been the chief operating officer, head of engineering and chief of product development. Under Mehrotra's leadership SanDisk's annual revenue peaked at $6.6 billion and the company sold for $16 billion in 2016 to Western Digital. With long experience leading a major memory manufacturer, Mehrotra is one of the most highly-qualified candidates possible to take over at Micron.
Outgoing CEO Mark Durcan will be stepping down as CEO and from the board of directors effective May 8 but plans to stay on as an advisor until early August. Mehrotra plans to divide his time between Micron headquarters in Boise, Idaho and Micron's Silicon Valley offices in Milpitas, California, a few blocks from SanDisk headquarters.

ADATA Launches ISSS314 and IM2P3388 Industrial SSDs: 3D NAND, Extreme Temps
                        by Anton Shilov
   		    
6 comments



ADATA has introduced two new families of 3D NAND-based SSDs aimed at industrial applications. Dubbed the ISSS314 and the IM2P3388, these drives are designed to handle extreme temperatures as well as humidity levels, allowing them to work reliably in very tough environmental conditions. The more powerful IM2P3388 drives use a PCIe interface and offer high performance levels along with a powerful ECC engine and encryption, whereas the less speedy ISSS314 uses a SATA interface and offers very low power consumption that barely tops 2.5 W.

The IM2P3388: M.2, High Performance, Extreme Temps, Encryption, TCG Opal

The ADATA IM2P3388 is an M.2 drive that uses a NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 interface and is based on 3D MLC NAND. This specific drive is designed to withstand ESD and...
