Dane Creek Capital Wants to Fund Pet Industry Business By Pet Product News Staff
 


Published: 2016.10.21 07:00 AM




Dane Creek Capital Corp. (DCCC) in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, announced its intent to partner with new pet industry companies seeking fresh sources of funding and expert management support. Established by pet industry veterans Mark Warren and Glen Tennison, the new merchant banking venture expects to close on up to three investments by end of 2016.
DCCC’s primary focus is on up-and-coming companies serving the companion animal industry that currently generate annual revenue between $1 million and $5 million and need additional financing and management support to expand their operations, the company stated. The company also said it will fund pure startups in new market opportunities that have yet to be fulfilled.
“The pet industry has long been an exciting marketplace for new ideas and financial opportunities,” said Warren. “I have had the great fortune to experience this firsthand in my own endeavors and through Dane Creek Capital, I look forward to assisting other entrepreneurs take their businesses to new levels.”
Warren and Tennison together have more than 30 years of business experience in the pet industry. Warren is the founder and former president and CEO of Pethealth Inc., which he formed in 1998. Under his leadership, Pethealth became the world’s largest provider of companion animal microchip technology, and a leading provider of pet insurance, cloud-based software and online pet specialty retail to pet owners, veterinarians and animal welfare organizations throughout North America and the U.K., said DCCC in a statement.
Tennison, CFO at Pethealth from its creation in 1998 until it was sold, led Pethealth’s acquisitions, including that of Nestlé Purina’s pet insurance business, PurinaCare; the acquisition of Domestic and General Group Limited’s U.K. pet insurance provider, Pet Protect Ltd.; and the acquisition of VetMedsDirect.co.uk, an online retailer of pet specialty products.
“Reliable growth in the pet sector makes it the ideal place for new investments and our hands-on experience in a variety of pet industry categories, both B2B and B2C, makes Dane Creek Capital the ideal business partner for developing pet product and service companies,” said Tennison.
Within the companion animal market, DCCC said its initial focus will be on investment opportunities in pet food and treats derived from novel proteins, fresh food waste, sustainable sources, alternative models for veterinary care, bio-technology, pet insurance, pet hotels and technology applications for pet owners.
Companies interested in working with DCCC should contact Tennison at gt@danecreekcap.com or (905) 581-7412.

DANE CAPITAL – private equity investment company

We create partnerships with entrepreneurs, business owners and management teams across sectors to preserve, add value and build businesses to the next level of success


 
 
 
INTRODUCTION
DANE CAPITAL is a private investment company based in Copenhagen. We have a long investment track record in private companies and operate as a private equity pledge fund. Unlike a traditional private equity fund with committed capital in a closed-end fund structure (defined exit period) we invest our own capital alongside capital from high calibre private and institutional investors without a defined exit period.
We invest in quality companies with revenues between DKK 30-300m (EUR 4-40m) together with management and business owners to persevere and grow the business for long-term value creation. In principle, we can own our companies indefinitely and create liquidity for our investors through dividends and recapitalisations, but may decide to sell a business when time and circumstances are right.
Our investments are made on a deal-by-deal basis with an industry agnostic approach in Denmark, Sweden and Northern Germany. We typically take majority ownership but can also take minority positions at the right terms.
We want to partner with companies where we can add value as an active and engaged investor and we only invest in companies where we have a complete understanding of the business model and the risks involved.
Our investment team consist of highly experienced professionals with backgrounds from private equity, investment banking, strategy consulting and senior executive management positions across industries. We have a strong network of industrial and operational advisors to assist us in defining and executing on key value creating activities.
 
 
 
 



INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
Strong returns are created by buying the right business with the right people at the right price combined with a clear strategy. Together with our partners, we define the full potential and risks of our businesses in order to manage and optimise the opportunities while controlling and minimising the risks. This may sound elementary but nevertheless this is the most difficult challenge when buying small- and mid-cap companies (SME’s). Every situation is different and it is all about understanding the needs of all key people involved in the business pre- and post-completion. Thus, our investment approach and partnership model is just as much about the people than then numbers.
 
 
 
 




INVESTMENT CONDITIONS
All investments have different attributes, but our investments will typically include the following main characteristics:
 
 
 


Buy-out features:

SME’s with revenues between DKK 30-300 million and earnings (EBITDA or EBIT) between DKK 5-30 million
Company well positioned in its niche segment
Solid and stable cash-flow
Majority positions typically structured as leveraged buyouts (Newco structure)

 
Growth Capital features:

Proven technology growth companies with revenues and (or close to) cash-flow positive
Owners seeking new active partner with capital and knowledge to take company to the next level
Minority positions typically structured as capital increase (new shares) for defined growth initiatives

 
Investment situations: 

Owner-led or family owned businesses seeking a generational change
Corporate spin-outs
Management buyouts
Industrial niche companies
Owners seeking capital, access to large network and active partner
