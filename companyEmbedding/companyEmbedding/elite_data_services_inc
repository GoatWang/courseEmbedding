Elite Data Services Inc: Why This E-Mail Promoted Stock May Crash Hard - Elite Data Services Inc. (OTCMKTS:DEAC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Elite Data Services Inc: Why This E-Mail Promoted Stock May Crash HardJan. 7.15 | About: Elite Data (DEAC) Investor Protection Association Short onlySummaryWe have received numerous e-mails touting DEAC from various stock promoters.The timing of the emails promoting DEAC coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in price and trading volume of the stock.The recent financials, balance sheet and cash flow report of the company appear to be very bleak.We have not contacted the company regarding the claims in the article.Note: This article is about a nano-cap stock (also referred to as a "penny stock"). While all investments are risky, nano-cap stocks are among the most risky. Among microcap stocks, the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns (such as DEAC). They are also among the most illiquid stocks, usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment. Quite often, it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position. DEAC is no exception to that. DEAC is a nano-cap stock which is traded on the OTC Markets and priced well below the 5$ mark. The readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article.
Introduction
DEAC (OTCPK:DEAC) is a company trading at a price which has recently ran from a range of approximately $1.60-1.70 to a high of $2.30 during the course of just a few days. In this article, we will outline the facts which are, in our opinion, related to the sudden increase in the price and trading volume of this usually thinly-traded, low volume stock.
The Promotion
Let us analyze the recent price action and trade volume of DEAC:
The trading volume and price of DEAC have both increased slightly during December 2014. Promotional emails were sent on several occasions during that month and during the following month also. It is quite obvious that the emails being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and price of the stock are interconnected events.


The Reality: Nearly Zero Revenue, Negative/Nearly Zero Net Income, Huge Dreams?
As it often happens with aggressively promoted companies, a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture. It seems that Elite Data Services Inc is of no exception to that rule.
In our opinion, it is clear that the current price of DEAC has nothing in common with the stock's true value. If we take a look at DEAC's income statement, we would see that the company's revenue has remained nearly zero and during the entire year of 2014, while its net income has been mostly negative during that period of time:

Moreover, if we check the latest 10-Q form filed on 11/14/2014, we would see that the company is actually classified as a going concern (with all the attendant circumstances):

It is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that DEAC's current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at over-inflated prices, rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market. But why, you ask?
The Reason
Why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised? That is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock. The answer for this hides, of course, in the small print. Let us have a look at the disclaimer found in the promotional emails touting DEAC which we've received:


In simple, plain English: someone - may it be the promoter sending out the email message or a third party which had paid the promoter in cash for sending the message - is holding shares of DEAC and plans to get rid of them ("dump" them) in the open market. Therefore, our conclusion is that the promotional email's sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices, while the promoters (or third party) unload their shares upon them.
Conclusion
It is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article we hold the opinion that DEAC shares are essentially worthless. We believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock. This practice is well known and is done exclusively for one reason only - so the insiders can unload ("dump") their shares (which they had previously acquired for almost free) in the free market onto unsuspecting investors, while taking advantage of the stocks' inflated price. In view of that, we would recommend any investor who had purchased shares of the company to liquidate his entire position immediately. Even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing.
Our View
"Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man" - Friedrich Nietzsche
For longs: If you are long the stock, we believe you should consider getting out immediately. It is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stocks' price is likely to be temporary, as it will never repeat its' previous highs. We believe DEAC has a price target of around $0.01, which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks (or months at most). If you have already accrued losses on the stock, sell now so as to avoid additional losses. Do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs. Do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many. We believe DEAC stock's price will drop 90% or more in the following weeks. It may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now.

"Look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy; profit from folly rather than participate in it" - Warren Buffett
For shorts: Bearing the aforementioned facts in mind, we believe sophisticated investors will quickly apprehend the idea that shorting DEAC may be a lucrative opportunity, as we are convinced that the potential downside for DEAC is substantial. If you are able to locate borrows, we believe shorting DEAC may prove to be profitable, as its price may prove to be highly inflated.

Elite Data Services: Poor Financials, Ambiguous Business Practices And A Paid Pump - Elite Data Services Inc. (OTCMKTS:DEAC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Elite Data Services: Poor Financials, Ambiguous Business Practices And A Paid PumpJan.21.15 | About: Elite Data (DEAC) Hunter Straus Long-term horizon, Growth, long/short equitySummaryElite Data Services has under $1,600 in cash, yet claims to be operating multiple complex business lines.Current insiders own over 98% of the company's stock.The company has switched between multiple unrelated businesses over the past several years.Management filed an 8-K which confirmed that it would be engaging an "investor relations service"; promotional emails soon followed.Background
Elite Data Services, Inc. (OTCPK:DEAC), formerly Dynamic Energy Alliance Corporation has been the subject of a recent series of promotional emails. What is particularly interesting about this stock pump is that the company filed an 8-K stating that it would be engaging an investor relations service (and would be compensating them with stock) just before the first round of promotional emails went out. Furthermore, the company's 8-K detailing these conditions was not made public until after the promotional emails went out. However, the circumstances beyond the company's promotion are even more interesting -- a history of unrelated business lines and constantly changing executives are just a few of the red flags about this company.
Business
If you visit the company's website at www.edscompanies.com you are greeted with a homepage which vaguely suggests that the company is a somewhat diversified conglomerate that operates in a variety of businesses. On the left hand side of the homepage it displays,

This tells us that the company was engaged in marketing, but is now shifting its priorities towards the gaming and resorts, and is looking for a location to use its newly-acquired casino license. It sounds ambiguous and is unclear, as these businesses are quite different, but it is forgivable if the company's public filings are in order and can back up the story. Unfortunately, if you look at the company's most recent 10-Q, there is no mention of the casino business at all -- the company's stated business engagements are completely different. The only mention of the casino license transaction occurred in an 8-K that was filed on December 1, 2014.

From the company's most recent 10-Q, Elite Data Services, Inc's describes its business as follows,

Elite Data Services, Inc. changed its name from Dynamic Energy Alliance Corporation on November 4, 2013. Prior to that, we were formerly Mammatech Corporation, and were incorporated in the State of Florida on November 23, 1981 under the name Mammathetics Corp.
The Company is engaged primarily in the marketing and advertising sector pertaining to the following: classifiedride.com and autoglance.com. Launched to the public in February 2012, ClassifiedRide's platform was designed to revolutionize the selling and buying for online automotive markets. Currently, ClassifiedRide provides a classified listing platform where users can list their vehicle, truck, boat (i.e. anything that has a motor) to the Company's website (either by free or paid listing options). The main premise of the website is to aid the private seller in selling or trading their vehicle. The Company, in turn, then works as the community leader to establish relationships between buyers and sellers using social media platforms and consumer customer support incentives. These relationships are used to generate revenue from private sellers, dealerships, affiliate lead providers, and third party advertisers.
Autoglance is a search engine of used cars that prioritizes and compares inventory in individualized markets by displaying the best deals first while hiding listings that are older, more expensive, and have more mileage. Autoglance currently has a provisional patent for this method of organizing and displaying vehicles. More specifically, Autoglance's invention group's vehicles of the same make and model in a market location to determine the best price based on the market value of the vehicle. Vehicles that are deemed worse deals are hidden from the user. The user may easily see hidden cars if he/she wishes by the click of a button.

The company's 10-Q makes no mention of the casino business or plans to engage in it at all. If you poke around on the company website enough, there is a section where it mentions the company's automotive-oriented businesses, but the presentation makes it seem like a side venture.

If one does a Google search for "classified ride" the very first hit that one gets is a negative testimonial claiming that it is a scam -- not the first thing that I want to see when looking for the company. In fact, I was unable to find any positive testimonials about the website, as all sources that named the website stated that there had been sort of phishing attempt. While this could be due to unsavory individuals prowling the website in search of potential victims, it doesn't speak well to the security and operation of the website.
Preliminary research did not look that great, so I took a look at Autoglance. When one goes to www.autoglance.com and searches for anything, there are 0 results -- absolutely none. I tried a variety of zip codes and searched for any make/model at any price with any amount of miles on it and still found nothing.
So the company's "marketing and advertising" business ventures appear to have an extremely negative public perception or are simply nonexistent.
Dynamic Energy Alliance
It is important to note that the company previously engaged in completely different businesses -- if one looks up "Dynamic Energy Alliance Corp.," you will find that the company's business was described as,
"...Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Dynamic Energy Development Corporation ("DEDC"), the Company has a business plan to develop, commercialize, and sell innovative technologies in the recoverable energy sector. Specifically, it is focused on identifying, combining and enhancing existing industry technologies with proprietary recoverable production and finishing processes to produce synthetic oil, carbon black, gas, and carbon steel from discarded or waste tires waste. This process will be accomplished with limited residual waste product and significant reductions in greenhouse gases, compared to traditional processing. To maximize this opportunity, the Company has developed a scalable, commercial development strategy to build "Energy Campuses" with low operational costs and long-term, recurring revenues."

It seems interesting that the company would switch from producing synthetic oil from old tires to creating websites for searching for used cars, and then engaging in the casino/resort business...all with less than $2,000 in cash!
Prior to being Dynamic Energy Alliance, the company was Mammatech Corporation. In the company's filings it states that from 1981 through the first quarter of 2011, the Company's business was that of a marketer of tumor detection equipment. The transition from being in the medical industry for 30 years to becoming a renewable energy company is not described very clearly. I'd like a bit more detail as to why the company seemingly abruptly made this change, but it is not in the filings.
Financials
This is where things begin to vary drastically between the company's presentation and goals, and what is actually feasible. According to the company's most recent 10-Q, it has $1,571 in cash and $589,041 in intangible assets. That amount of cash doesn't seem like enough to accomplish much - but let's have a look at the notes to the financial statements to see what this $589,041 in intangibles is,
"The Company's intangible asset value and note balance to a related party were reduced to the appropriate carrying value of $589,041 as of June 30, 2014. The change was done in accordance with GAAP, ASC 805-50-30 which relates to the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the date of transfer by related parties."
That is the only description given for the company's intangibles, nothing about who the related parties were, or what they were from, or what can be done with them.
Additionally, the company has $1.38 million in current liabilities and $1.97 million in total liabilities.
In the most recent quarter it had $3,192 in revenue and net income of $100,794. While the company generated positive net income, it is important to note that $164,999 was gained on extinguishment of debt; there is no discussion on this item, as it seems like a very important part of the company's financials.

With respect to cash flow, the company's operations used $113,813; not a good sign if the company has less than $1,600 in the bank, and no surprise that it has a Going Concern clause in its most recent 10-Q,
The company has a net loss from operation of $166,816 and accumulated deficit of $6,421,451. The company currently has only limited working capital with which to continue its operating activities. The amount of capital required to sustain operations is subject to future events and uncertainties. The company must secure additional working capital through loans, sale of equity securities, or a combination, in order to implement its business plans. There can be no assurance that such funding will be available in the future, or available on commercially reasonable terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Never a good sign - the fundamentals look bleak and are inconsistent what the company presents on the surface or in its business plans.
Insider Ownership and Management
According to the company's latest 10-K filed on May 12, 2014, all officers and directors hold 98.89% of the company's common stock. Since the 10-K was filed, there have been no Form 4s or any other filings that indicate that this has changed.
Following his resignation, three new individuals were appointed for the separate roles of chief executive officer and director, chief financial officer and president. It was not made clear whether these individuals have employment agreements with the company, and their compensation was not disclosed.
The most recent 10-K states that the company has no significant employees besides its executive officers; hardly what seems necessary to execute its business strategy. Since then, it seems that the only employees are still the executive officers and directors.
Paid promotion
From the company's most recent 8-K filed on December 10, 2014 it reads:
"On December 3, 2014, Elite Data Services, Inc. ("Company"), and EraStar Inc. ("EraStar" or the "Consultant") entered into an Investor Relations Consulting Agreement (the "Agreement") to advise the Company regarding investor communications, public relations with shareholders, brokers, dealers and other investment professionals as to the Company's current and proposed activities. The duties of EraStar include, but are not limited to: advising, consulting and assisting the Company in developing and implementing appropriate plans and means for presenting the Company and its business plans, strategy and personnel to the financial community, assisting in establishing an image for the Company in the financial community, and assisting in creating the foundation for subsequent financial public relation efforts. As consideration for the services described in the Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay Consultant a one-time retainer of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) within twenty (20) business days from the signing of the Agreement and Fifteen Thousand ($15,000) per month upon signing of the Agreement. As an accommodation by the Consultant, the Company may issue stock in lieu of any cash payment if the Company is unable to fulfill their payment obligation. The Company has also agreed to issue the Consultant: (A) Eight Hundred Sixty-Nine Thousand Four Hundred Forty-One (869,441) shares of the Company's Common Stock payable as follows: Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares as a nonrefundable, non-apportionable, and non-ratable retainer, and Three Hundred Sixty-Nine Thousand Four Hundred and Forty-One (369,411) shares payable upon completion of the six month term, and (B) warrant to purchase One Million (1,000,000) shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $2.00 per share for a period of one year. Upon mutual consent by both the Company and the Consultant, the Agreement will be extended for another six (6) months, and if extended the Company will issue to the Consultant Eight Hundred Sixty Nine Thousand Four Hundred Forty One (869,441) shares of the Company's Common Stock within ten (10) business days thereafter."

So the company is paying an investor relations service to pump up the price of the stock, but is paying them in both cash AND stock. Sound fishy?
Note that the December 3 agreement date coincides with the first email advertisements which appeared on December 5, 2014 for Penny Stock Guru.com. Subsequent promotions followed from additional stock promotion sites.
Additionally, the date of the filing (December 10, 2014) would have made it impossible for the public to know that the company had initiated the services of a PR firm to pump the company's stock.
Conclusion
From a financial perspective, Elite Data Services, Inc. has a weak balance sheet and is bleeding cash -- the company needs to secure a source of financing soon, likely in the form of issuing more equity. While poor financials can be forgivable if there is something exciting in the business, it really is not clear what the company's goals are; it claims to have switched business models so many times in a short period of time. On top of that, the company filed a statement with the SEC that essentially admitted that it was engaging in a paid promotion for its stock and was paying the promoters in stock. Surely, there must be some conflict of interest there, as the company's filings indicate that insiders owns nearly all of the stock.
Beyond the company's poor financials, one of the company's businesses has been reported to be a scam or fraught with scammers from several sources (in the instance of classifiedride.com) or appears to be nonexistent or at least nonfunctional (in the instance of autoglance.com).
If you have received promotional emails claiming that Elite Data Services, Inc. is the next greatest thing, reconsider what is being advertised. Have a look at the company's public filings -- they are an amazing source of information that will let you know what lies beneath the surface.
