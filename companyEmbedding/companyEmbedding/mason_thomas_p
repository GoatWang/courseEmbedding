How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Mason Thomas P Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Mason Thomas P Jr currently holds license 110465 (Electrician, Me Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Mason Thomas P Jr



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Mason Thomas P Jr



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Mason Thomas P Jr



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

A Lords of Davenia Novel
Scoundrel by nature and master thief by trade, Mouse is the best there is. Sure, his methods may not make him many friends, but he works best alone anyway. And he has never failed a job.
But that could change.
When a stranger with a hefty bag of gold seduces him to take on a task, Mouse knows he’ll regret it. The job? Free Lord Garron, the son of a powerful duke arrested on trumped up charges in a rival duchy. Mouse doesn’t do rescue missions. He’s no altruistic hero, and something about the job reeks. But he cannot turn his back on that much coin—enough to buy a king’s pardon for the murder charge hanging over his head.
Getting Garron out of his tower prison is the easy part. Now, they must escape an army of guardsmen, a walled keep and a city on lockdown, and a ruthless mage using her power to track them. Making matters worse, Mouse is distracted by Garron’s charm and unyielding integrity. Falling for a client can lead to mistakes. Falling for a nobleman can lead to disaster. But Mouse is unprepared for the dangers behind the plot to make Lord Garron disappear.

Fun fast paced fantasy




			By Cat  on  May 7, 2017 02:05



			Lord Mouse isn't  my usual genre though on occasion I do read some fantasy. I heard so much about this one I thought I would give it a try and am glad I did. It was quite a refreshing change of pace. 
When it first came on, I couldn't believe it was Joel Leslie narrating. He sounded so different and still gave all the characters accents and personality. I don't know how he does all this with his voice, but I am impressed. I also want to say that I think if I read it I wouldn't have enjoyed it as well with all the names and village names etc. I usually stumble across those, and it slows the flow of the story. Listening to Joel tell it kept me engrossed and eager to hear more.

If you like stories of knights, noblemen, thieves, magic and a great romance to boot you will love this one.

Review of Lord Mouse




			By Davonne Burns  on  Nov 22, 2015 01:11



			ve been reading a lot of great books lately but its been a rare thing to find a book that hits all my literary kinks.
Ive been searching for well crafted fantasy with queer characters for so long I almost decided to write something myself. Then I happened upon a review by Just Love that sounded promising.
Boy did it deliver.
Lord Mouse is everything Ive been lusting after in a fantasy novel. The main character is Mouse, a tiny little badass thief and assassin, and no he doesnt have a heart of gold but he does pride himself on a job well done. If you can afford him. Hes never failed a job and when he gets a chance at a challenging job that pays more coin than hes ever seen hes not about to turn it down.
And thats exactly what gets him into trouble.
Thomas does a fantastic job at throwing you right into Mouses world and a dark, dirty, gritty world it is. Thomas takes you from the cruel criminal underbelly, up the rungs of the social ladder in a way that feels natural, but not too easy. Mouse has to work for his contacts and information and sometimes its a blade and sometimes its a bed.
As an asexual Im not a big fan of casual hook-ups but the sex scenes were never gratuitous and were mostly fade-to-black moments. This was something I appreciated. The story was about Mouses character growth, not about sexual escapades.
It was also very refreshing to read a book where being gay wasnt something to angst over. It was just treated as part of who he is, which in my opinion, is as it should be.
I loved getting to know Mouse but I sincerely wish the story had been longer and I think it should have been. The first act is spent getting Mouse into position to do this big rescue mission and then we spend the next act of the book with him trying to escape. I did enjoy it very much, but I felt the last third was rushed and would have liked to have seen Garron and Mouse get to know each other better before the end. The big reveal at the end could have packed a lot more punch had we had a chance to get to know Garron better.
Ideally the rescue could have happened by the end of the first act and the second act could have had a longer build up to the finale. I feel that a longer second act would have helped with the rushed feel to their relationship and the finale. I would have happily read 80-100K words of these two.
I was also disappointed with the copy editing and found a few instances where a side characters name was misspelled from one page to the next, which wouldnt have been a big deal but it threw me out of the story for a moment as I tried to figure out who was being mentioned.
Overall, these issues were minor and I thoroughly enjoyed the story and am eager to read anything else Thomas writes.

It has no embellishments, just basic shoe necessities brought to life with every detail, creating a juxtaposition of seriousness and playfulness. FLYKNIT ORIGINS Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners craving a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability-all in one layer-was refined.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Thomas Mason has the following 7 areas of expertise,  1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
