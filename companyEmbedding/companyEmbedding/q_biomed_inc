 Q BioMed Inc. (OTCQB: QBIO) Breaking News - April 25, 
2017


 
Q Biomed Announces Licensing Agreement for Development of 
Drug to Treat Rare Pediatric Disorder

 
New Treatment in Development Looks to Treat 
Rare Condition that Robs Approximately 20,000 US Children per Year of their 
Ability to Speak
New York, NY–(April 25, 2017)– Q BioMed Inc (OTCQB:
QBIO) and ASDERA LLC 
today announce a licensing agreement that provides Q Biomed with the worldwide 
exclusive rights to ASDERA’s ASD-002, which is being developed to treat a rare 
pediatric nonverbal disorder. Under the terms of the agreement, Q Biomed 
receives global rights to develop and commercialize the drug in the rare 
pediatric disease market. 

Among the more than 60,000 US children who develop autism spectrum disorders (ASD) 
every year, 20,000 become nonverbal or lose the ability to speak. The numbers 
are similar in Europe and this nonverbal group will have to rely on assisted 
living for the rest of their life. 

Denis Corin, CEO of Q Biomed said, “Given the severity of this disorder, and the 
immense emotional toll on these children and their families, our goal is to move 
the product forward quickly by using all the regulatory tools available to us to 
expedite the advancement of this drug candidate.” 

The cost for treatment and assisted living in the US alone can equal or exceed 
ten million dollars per patient over a lifetime. The estimated cost to the US 
healthcare system and lost productivity is estimated at 200 billion dollars 
each. Currently there is no treatment for this disorder. EEG, behavioral, and 
genetic testing can identify a very targeted population of 
children in their second year of life that we believe would respond to this 
treatment.

Research published in 2014 by Wittkowski et al in the Nature journal 
Translational Psychiatry and independently confirmed in 2015 by Gugliemi et al 
indicated that certain ion channels were not active enough in this targeted 
population. ASD-002 is designed to ameliorate this age-specific condition by 
activating these ion channels. If the second year of life treatment window is 
missed, many of these children may lose the ability to speak while others may 
never start to speak at all.

“We are very excited about the potential of ASD-002 and hopefully this will 
allow thousands of children each year to develop speech and live independent and 
productive lives,” added Corin.

“ASDERA’s mission is to focus on developing targeted therapies for diseases 
where there is a high unmet need,” said Dr. Knut Wittkowski. “We are grateful to 
be working with Q Biomed, which immediately saw the potential of ASD-002 and are 
committed to ensuring that ASD-002 reaches its intended target patient 
population.”

About This Rare Pediatric Nonverbal Disorder
Early physiological and behavioral signs of becoming nonverbal appear around 
nine months of age and include: excessive crying, abnormal eye tracking, and 
epileptiform EEG. These children may never speak or might begin speaking a few 
words and then “regress” and lose their ability to speak, while developing on 
the autism spectrum. Pathological symptoms manifest at the age of 24 months, at 
which age post-mortem scans reveal patchy regions of disorganization in cortical 
brain regions.

About ASDERA
ASDERA is a privately held biotech company, whose mission is to provide 
solutions for diseases with high unmet needs. The results leading to ASD-002 
were derived using a proprietary discovery platform that uniquely analyzes 
genetic data to identify collections of functionally related genes and, thus, 
possible drugs to modulate these functions. This platform has also been 
successfully applied to analyze clinical trials to identify targeted patient 
populations more likely to respond to therapy.

Company Uses Capital to Advance Business and 
Expand Pipeline
New York, NY–(April 10, 2017)– Q BioMed Inc (OTCQB:
QBIO), has closed on 
its final tranche of the $4,000,000 funding announced on November 30th, 2016. 
The company received $1,500,000 less fees on the final closing, bringing the 
total gross funds received to date to $4MM.

Capital from the transaction will be used to advance our business plan and 
pipeline as we commercialize our first asset, Strontium Chloride 89 injection 
(SR89). SR89 is indicated for bone pain palliation, providing long-lasting 
relief for patients suffering from debilitating bone pain due to metastatic

Q BIOMED INC. COMPLETES 2nd CLOSING ON $4,000,000 FUNDING

 
COMPANY GEARS UP FOR PRODUCTION OF CANCER PAIN PALLIATION DRUG WITH COMMERCIAL 
LAUNCH EXPECTED IN Q2 2017
New York, NY–(March 22, 2017)– Q BioMed Inc (OTCQB:
QBIO), has closed on 
its 2nd tranche of the $4,000,000 funding announced on November 30th 2016. The 
company received $1,000,000 on the 2nd closing bringing the total received to 
date to $2.5MM. We expect to receive the remaining $1.5MM upon on effectiveness 
of our recently filed registration statement on Form S-1.

In addition, we are pleased to announce that we have begun process validation 
for the manufacturing of the non-narcotic analgesic treatment for pain 
associated with metastatic bone cancer. The drug, generic Strontium Chloride 89 
injection, provides long-lasting relief for patients suffering from debilitating 
bone pain due to metastatic cancer, typically caused by 
advanced-stage breast, prostate or lung cancer. It has been proven to provide a 
long-term effect, resulting in cancer pain relief and enhanced quality of life.


There are approximately 350,000 cases of patients living with bone metastases in 
the U.S. alone. In addition, 380,000 new diagnoses of patients with breast, 
prostate and lung cancer occur every year and approximately 1 in 3 of those will 
develop bone metastases. 

The delivery of an affordable, non-narcotic pain therapy is a much needed and 
underutilized option for this patient population and coincides well with the 
recently passed 21st Century Cures Act combating opiate overuse and abuse.  
The Act, provides $1 billion in funding over the next two years for opioid 
addiction prevention and treatment programs to develop, promote and use 
non-narcotic alternative therapies. 

The commercialization of the drug allows us to deliver an effective and much 
needed alternative to hundreds of thousands of suffering patients. We are very 
pleased to offer this U.S. Food and Drug administration approved therapy to 
patients in the very near term. We are currently negotiating US based contract 
manufacturing organization (CMO) agreements and expect to have those completed 
along with the commercial launch in Q2 2017.

Q BIOMED JOINS WITH OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION AND 
RAJIV GANDHI CENTRE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP LIVER CANCER CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC
 

New York, NY–(February 7, 2017)– Q BioMed Inc (OTCQB:
QBIO), has entered into 
an agreement with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) and the Rajiv 
Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) to develop a chemotherapeutic technology 
to treat liver cancer.

The technology will utilize “uttroside B” and the compound’s derivatives as a 
chemotherapeutic agent against hepatocellular carcinoma. The preclinical 
efficacy of uttroside B, a potent saponin, against liver cancer was recently 
demonstrated in a November 3, 2016 study published in Scientific Reports, a 
Nature journal.

The compound has been isolated and characterized from the leaves of Solanum 
nigrum Linn, a plant widely used in traditional medicine. In the Scientific 
Reports study, researchers showed that in animal models, uttroside B was ten 
times more cytotoxic to the HepG2 liver cancer cell line than the only drug 
currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for liver cancer.

Uttroside B drastically shrunk tumors in mice bearing human liver cancer 
xenografts. In addition, in pre-clinical experiments uttroside B induced 
cytotoxicity in all liver cancer cell lines, irrespective of their hepatitis B 
virus status, while being non-toxic to normal immortalized hepatocytes.

Chemotherapeutic options for liver cancer are limited, and the prognosis of 
patients remains challenging. According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, it is the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, 
claiming approximately 750,000 lives each year. In the US, the American Cancer 
Society estimates that 39,000 people will be diagnosed with primary liver cancer 
in 2017 and that 27,000 will die from the disease this year.

The currently available drug has been shown to increase survival by only a short 
period of time. That drug also been reported to carry a variety of serious side 
effects, including increased blood pressure, bleeding problems, decreased blood 
flow to the heart and heart attacks.

In the Scientific Reports study, uttroside B was shown to be several times more 
potent than the currently available drug and did not cause noticeable side 
effects in vitro or in vivo. 

“We are encouraged by the preclinical results we observed in this data and look 
forward to working with our collaborators at OMRF and RGCB to carry out further 
pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of uttroside B,” Q BioMed Inc. CEO Denis 
Corin said. “Our ultimate goal is to use it as an effective chemotherapeutic 
against liver cancer, which currently has very few therapeutic options.”

The uttroside B technology is covered by a provisional patent application. To 
see the full Scientific Reports study, go to: http://www.nature.com/articles/srep36318

Q Biomed Comments on its Glaucoma Drug and Industry News in 
the Ophthalmology Space
 

New York, NY–(October 7 2016)– Q BioMed Inc (OTCQB:
QBIO), a biotechnology 
acceleration company with a glaucoma drug in development through its partner 
Mannin Research provides this update on the MAN-01 program and its relevance in 
the glaucoma market.

Over the last few weeks a number of significant deals and announcements have 
been made in the ophthalmology space. Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s shares 
soared giving the company a market cap over $1 billion after the company 
announced successful 90-day primary efficacy data from the first phase III 
registration study, Mercury 1, on Roclatan.

Roclatan (once daily) is being evaluated for its ability of lowering intraocular 
pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

Q BioMed is developing a first in class drug targeting the Schlemm's canal and 
its role in regulating IOP, one of the leading causes of glaucoma. No other 
glaucoma company is targeting the Schlemm's Canal, the main drainage pathway in 
the eye. This unique vessel is responsible for 70-90% of the fluid drainage in 
the eye. The MAN-01 drug is currently in the lead optimization stage of its 
pre-clinical testing.

The success of this Aerie trial is an indication of the importance of this 
market, and the acute need for novel drugs to treat the over 60 million 
sufferers of this disease.

In related corporate sector news, Allergan plc, a leading global pharmaceutical 
company, and AqueSys, Inc. a private clinical stage medical device company 
focused on developing ocular implants that reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) 
associated with glaucoma, announced that they have entered into an agreement 
under which Allergan will acquire AqueSys in an all-cash transaction for a $300 
million upfront payment and regulatory approval and commercialization milestone 
payments related to AqueSys' lead development programs.

Abbott Laboratories signed another multi-billion-dollar transaction that 
reaffirms growing interest in ophthalmology companies. In this deal, Abbott 
Laboratories is selling, Abbott Medical Optics to Johnson & Johnson Inc. for 
$4.325 billion in cash.

These transactions are another validation for Q BioMed and its platform 
treatment program with Mannin Research. The industry heavyweights are actively 
looking for, and acquiring innovative products in this space. We are also 
looking at additional indications and products to fit within our ophthalmology 
vertical.

Q BioMed Closes Licensing Agreement for FDA Approved Drug
 
Cancer palliation drug expected to start generating revenue 
in less than 12 months 

New York, NY–(September 8, 2016)– Q BioMed Inc (OTCQB:
QBIO), a biotechnology 
acceleration company is pleased to announce the closing of an exclusive license 
and option agreement for a FDA approved generic drug, Strontium Chloride 
("SR89").

This licensed radiopharmaceutical agent is indicated for the treatment of pain 
associated with metastatic bone cancer. SR89 provides long lasting relief for 
patients suffering from bone pain due to metastatic cancer, typically caused by 
advanced-stage breast, prostate or lung cancer. The drug is preferentially 
absorbed in bone metastases, it has been proven to provide a long-term effect 
resulting in non--narcotic cancer pain relief and enhanced quality of life.

Our immediate efforts and resources will focus on the material procurement and 
manufacturing process as well as preparing the marketing plan and distribution 
strategy. This drug is expected to be 
revenue ready within a short time frame and we aim to generate sales within the 
first year.

We will make every effort to make this drug as widely available as possible and 
ensure that the drug will be priced competitively at a cost to patients that is 
lower than what they are currently paying. In the current environment of 
skyrocketing drug and medical costs, we believe this is a welcome deviation from 
the recent headlines.

There are approximately 300,000 new cases of bone metastases in patients with 
breast and lung cancer per year in the U.S. alone. Approximately 80% of patients 
using SR89 have reported experiencing a substantial decrease in pain, an 
increase in physical activity and a reduction in the need for opiate analgesics, 
such as morphine.

Further, we believe there is an opportunity to invest additional resources into 
the program to grow the revenue potential significantly. We look forward to 
making additional details available as soon as practical.

Denis Corin, CEO of Q BioMed Inc. said, "We are very excited about the potential 
for this drug and look forward to bringing it to market as quickly as possible, 
delivering significant value to all stakeholders, including current and future 
patients. The revenue we hope to realize will be a significant milestone for us 
and substantially derisks our business. However, over and above the near term 
revenue, we are particularly enthusiastic about the opportunities for growth to 
increase the potential revenue exponentially. "

Q BioMed Inc. News:  SeeThruEquity Initiates Coverage on 
Q BioMed with a Price Target of $3.85
 
Q BioMed Inc. is to be featured on CEO Clips on The 
Documentary Channel as well as Thomson Reuters Insider Network at
http://reut.rs/29TZ6Th - CEO Clips, a 
series which profiles the most innovative publicly traded companies in North 
America, will feature QBIO on The Documentary Channel in August, Monday through 
Friday, throughout the day and evenings.
 New York, NY–(July 27, 2016)– SeeThruEquity, the leading independent 
equity research firm focused on smallcap and microcap public companies, today 
announced it has initiated coverage on Q BioMed Inc (OTCQB:
QBIO) with a price target 
of $3.85.

The report is available here:

http://www.seethruequity.com/#!qbio/cxnb. 

QBIO is focused on identifying, acquiring and licensing attractive biomedical 
assets from small private companies and academia, which lack the resources and 
experience to bring their programs to market on their own. QBIO believes it can 
add considerable value to its investments by providing strategic capital, 
industry resources and experience in order to accelerate the development and 
commercialization of life science assets. QBIO’s initial program is MAN-01, a 
small molecule designed to treat glaucoma, an eye disease which affects 60mn 
people globally, and is expected to affect over 100mn people by 2020E. The 
glaucoma market is a $5 billion annual market opportunity, for which no new 
drugs have been approved in approximately 20 years. The company acquired an 
exclusive license to MAN-01 from Mannin Research, Inc. The technology platform 
is based on the research of Dr. Susan Quaggin, Chief Scientific Officer of 
Mannin Research. Broadly, Dr. Quaggin's research demonstrates a unique approach 
to treating a host of vascular diseases including glaucoma, cystic kidney 
disease, influenza, ebola, and others. These additional indications are part of 
the exclusive license agreement with Mannin. In addition to the Mannin Research 
platform technology, QBIO has announced its intention to acquire 2-3 
additional programs over the next twelve months.

“In our view the experience and quality of management should a crucial role in 
the successful execution of the biomedical accelerator model. Indeed, the core 
value promised by QBIO is that it will be able to identify, develop, and support 
value-creating programs harvested from small private biomedical companies and 
academia, providing a conduit which would otherwise be difficult to access or 
unavailable to pubic company investors – and then provide strategic capital and 
other valuable resources to these companies to help them reach commercialization 
and/or a value-creating event. QBIO is led by CEO Denis Corin, who brings a 
wealth of experience in the biomedical field at both large pharmaceutical firms 
and small innovative firms in the biotech space,” stated Ajay Tandon, CEO of 
SeeThruEquity. “We see serval potential catalysts for the company in coming 
months, including the pending acquisition of a new cancer palliation drug. We 
are initiating coverage with a price target of $3.85.

Highlights from the report are as follows:

Promising initial program targeting glaucoma
QBIO’s initial asset is MAN-01, a preclinical small molecule designed for the 
treatment of glaucoma, an eye disease that affects 60mn people globally and 
represents a $5 billion annual market, according to the World Health 
Organization. Significantly, no new drugs for glaucoma have been approved in 20 
years, despite the current standard of care being effective at stopping the 
progression of glaucoma but not providing a cure. MAN-01 is a pre-clinical asset 
which QBIO has licensed from Mannin Research, and we expect the companies to 
provide details of the clinical study in 2017, with the first-in-human 
proof-of-concept clinical trial executed in 2018. 

New acquisitions on the horizon, with revenue a possibility
Beyond MAN-01, QBIO management is looking to make 2-3 acquisitions over the next 
year, including at least one with short-term revenue-generating potential. On 
June 1, 2016, QBIO announced that it entered into an agreement to exclusively 
license a “revenue ready,” FDA-approved drug indicated for pain care associated 
with metastatic bone cancer. QBIO has stated that the new program is expected to 
provide $1mn+ in revenues in the first year following the close of the deal with 
a goal of $10mn+ in annual sales within 3-5 years. The deal offers QBIO an 
attractive entry point to access to a cancer palliation drug undergoing label 
expansion to therapeutic, which management expects to result in a target market 
opportunity of approximately $1 billion per year within 36 months of the 
acquisition’s close.

Q BioMed Inc. Advisor and Mannin Research Inc CSO Dr Susan 
Quaggin Elequently Discusses Glaucoma and Man-01 with Eye on Vision Radio
 
Media Alert - Radio and Podcast Interview with Eye on 
Vision WYPL-FM 89.3
 NEW YORK, - July 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Q BioMed Inc (OTC:
QBIO), partner Mannin 
Research Inc. CSO Dr. Susan Quaggin discusses glaucoma, treatment options, and 
her novel findings on the relationship between Tie2/TEK signaling, Schelmm's 
Canal and glaucoma with Eye on Vision. In the interview Dr. Quaggin explains 
intraocular pressure (IOP), one of the major causes of glaucoma and her research 
into understanding Tie2/TEK signalling and its relationship with Schlemm's Canal 
function and regulation of intra-ocular pressure.

Mannin's researchers have received the first of several drug candidates for 
testing. Once finalized, the lead candidates will be formulated for clinical 
testing in a topical application in the form of an easy to administer eye drop. 
This is a key differentiator for Mannin and aims to solve the compliance 
problems and invasive procedures currently available to patients suffering from 
glaucoma.

In October 2015 Q BioMed Inc. entered into an agreement with Mannin Research to 
exclusively license, with an option to acquire, the platform technology assets 
of Mannin Research, the developer of a new class of vascular therapeutics 
including the technology discussed here.

Q BioMed Inc. Reports on Current and New Potential Assets
 
New Near Term Revenue Asset Deal Pending and MAN-01 Drug 
Candidate Optimization and Selection Progressing on Schedule
 NEW YORK, - June 1, 2016  /PRNewswire/ -- Q BioMed Inc (OTC:
QBIO), a biotechnology 
acceleration company is pleased to report on new potential asset 
license/acquisition and an update on Man 01 development.

We are pleased to announce that we have entered into a definitive agreement to 
exclusively license a FDA approved drug from a private U.S. Company focused on 
the development of generic pharmaceuticals.

The drug is indicated for the treatment of pain associated with metastatic bone 
cancer. As a result, this asset is expected to generate revenue within the first 
year post-closing. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain 
conditions being met to our satisfaction by the closing date, which we hope will 
be by the end of June.

We look forward to making additional details available as soon as practical.

Denis Corin, CEO of Q BioMed Inc. said, "We are very excited about the potential 
of this deal and look forward to bringing this transaction to fruition and 
thereby delivering significant value to all stakeholders, including the patients 
in need of this drug." 

In addition, Mannin Research Inc. our technology partner company focused on the 
discovery, development, and commercialization of first-in-class therapeutics for 
vascular diseases, provides an update on its drug development program, MAN-01 
for treatment of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG).

Mannin's primary indication, MAN-01 for treatment of POAG has initiated 
pre-clinical lead candidate optimization of a small molecule for topical 
application. Lead candidate selection is progressing on-time and on-budget. The 
topical application in the form of an easy to administer eye drop is a key 
differentiator for Mannin and aims to solve the compliance problems and invasive 
procedures currently available to patients suffering from glaucoma.

In addition, Mannin is continuing its focus on research and discovery on the 
biology of Tie2/TEK signalling and its relationship with Schlemm's Canal 
function and regulation of intra-ocular pressure. Additional data sets and IP 
have been developed around this novel mechanism of action. Mannin is evaluating 
strategic partnerships opportunities to grow its intellectual property portfolio 
within the Tie2/TEK signalling market, and is seeking complementary technologies 
to 
strengthen its product pipeline.

Mannin and Q BioMed executives will be attending the BIO International 
Convention (BIO 2016) from June 6-9 in San Francisco. BIO attracts over 15,000 
biotechnology and pharma leaders where Mannin will explore new opportunities and 
promising partnerships.

Mannin is currently in the third month of the Canada-Chicago Mentorship Program 
(C2MP) which is a part of the Chicago Innovation Mentors (CIM@MATTER) incubator. 
The mentorship team has provided valuable feedback on the MAN-01 program, as 
well as providing advice on Mannin's partnering approach and general business 
strategy.

"We are pleased with the progress our research teams have achieved over the past 
three months. We look forward to advancing our corporate and strategic goals as 
it relates to our lead candidate for treating Primary Open Angle Glaucoma," said 
George Nikopoulos, Mannin's CEO.

Dr. Susan Quaggin, Mannin's CSO added, "Recent work in the lab underscores the 
essential role of Angpt-Tie2/TEK signalling for development of the anterior 
chamber of the eye - which contain the structures needed to maintain safe levels 
of intraocular pressure. We are excited to begin to test compounds in 
preclinical studies." 

Lastly, Q BioMed has been conducting due diligence on several potential assets 
for other indications with the goal of expanding our pipeline and enhancing 
shareholder value.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.

Q BioMed Inc (OTCMKTS:QBIO) Shares Rise on Announcement of Cancer Drug Production

By Michael Luke -  June 12, 2017 455 




Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter











The last time we reported on Q BioMed Inc (OTCMKTS:QBIO), the stock was running sharply up the chart, as the company closed a massive round of funding, to the tune of $4M,.
This didn’t sit particularly well with the investment community, as shares of QBIO have been in a general downtrend since that time. But recently, that’s changed with a key revelation coming out of the QBIO camp regarding the production launch of a non-narcotic cancer pain treatment.
Q BioMed Inc (OTCMKTS:QBIO) announced that it had initiated production of Strontium-89 Chloride, a radiopharmaceutical indicated for the analgesic treatment of metastatic breast and prostate cancer bone pain.
To give a little background on how it works– Following intravenous injection, soluble strontium compounds behave like their calcium analogs, clearing rapidly from the blood and selectively localizing in bone mineral. Uptake of strontium by bone occurs preferentially in sites of active osteogenesis; thus primary bone tumors and areas of metastatic involvement (blastic lesions) can accumulate significantly greater concentrations of strontium than surrounding normal bone. Strontium-89 Chloride is retained in metastatic bone lesions much longer than in normal bone, where turnover is about 14 days.
Strontium-89 is a pure beta emitter and Strontium-89 Chloride selectively irradiates sites of primary and metastatic bone involvement with minimal irradiation of soft tissues distant from the bone lesions. Clinical trials have examined relief of pain in cancer patients who have received therapy for bone metastases (external radiation to indexed sites) but in whom persistent pain recurred.
Denis Corin, CEO of the Company said, “This is a major milestone in our short history. We are very excited to bring this product to market less than one year after finalizing the licensing agreement. There is an acute demand for an affordable and effective alternative to opiate based drugs in this patient population. We know this proven drug is effective and well tolerated with limited side-effects. We look forward to making it available as widely as possible and as quickly as possible. We believe there is significant opportunity to build this franchise and expand the revenue opportunity associated with it.”


Approximately 70% of patients with advanced breast and prostate cancer metastases will develop bone metastases, an extremely painful condition. Bone metastases occur in most tumor types but are most prevalent in cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung. These bone lesions can cause serious skeletal complications, including spinal cord or nerve root compression, hypercalcemia of malignancy, pathologic fractures, and severe bone pain which can significantly compromise quality of life and may negatively affect survival. Palliation of pain, prevention of skeletal complications, and maintenance of quality of life are the primary objectives in managing patients with metastatic bone disease.
AB-Rated Strontium Chloride Sr89 Injection USP (Sr89) can be used in combination with or to reduce the need for opiate based drugs, as well as in combination with cancer therapeutic drugs. After administration, pain relief can occur in as little as one to two weeks and can last several months, when another dose can be administered with minimal side effects. (Source: PR Newswire)
It’s an exciting revelation for the company, and to go along with the kicking off of Strontium-89 production, QBIO stock itself has been rebounding off of its lowest PPS since 2016. For those reasons, we’ll be interested to tracking this play moving forward. Follow along with us very easily; Just stay locked to Street Register for updates, and we’ll be sure to deliver important developments on QBIO should anything come along.

(QBIO), a biotechnology acceleration and development company will present at the  9th Annual Biotech Showcase™ 2017 being held January 9-11, 2017 at the Hilton San Francisco Union Square, California. Taking place during one of the industry's largest annual healthcare investor conferences, this investor and partnering conference attracts pharmaceutical executives from around the world focused on investment and business development opportunities in the life sciences industry.Conference Presentation Details: Presenter: Denis Corin - CEOWhere: Hilton San Francisco Union Square, 333 O'Farrell Street, San Francisco, CA 94102  When: Tuesday, January 10, 2017Time: 8:00 AMRoom: Room 3 - Ballroom Level  Webcast: https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1130761 live and replay 2hr after the event.Conference Website:  Biotech Showcase 2017Q BioMed management will host one-on-one meetings with investors at the conference between January 9-11, 2017. To meet with us, please submit a meeting request via the PartneringOne scheduling system.In addition we provide this update to those unable to attend.2016 was essentially our inaugural year, being our first full calendar year pursuing innovative opportunities in the biotechnology space. It was a very busy year as the Company established itself in the space and commenced its effort to find innovative technologies and management teams with inherent, yet unrealized, value. By adding strategic resources to accelerate the development of those technologies, we hope to realize that value.We closed 2016 with two pipeline technologies under the 'Q' umbrella; essentially bookends of the multi-asset business model we are building. One early stage, opportunity in the highly sought after glaucoma space and one FDA approved, drug for bone cancer palliation. In addition, we recently secured the funding to allow us to execute on the near term milestones to advance our business.Over the course of the next several months we will continue performing due diligence on additional attractive assets with the goal of adding one or more to our pipeline in calendar 2017.Review of Strontium Chloride 89 Injection (SR89): In September 2016 we licensed an FDA approved drug that provides relief for patients suffering from debilitating bone pain due to metastatic cancer, typically caused by advanced-stage breast, prostate or lung cancer. It has been proven to provide a long-term effect resulting in cancer pain relief and enhanced quality of life.Revenue from sales of our non-narcotic pain palliative drug will be a major catalyst for Q BioMed and we look forward to providing additional guidance on the timing of this in the near future.Review of Man-01 our glaucoma asset licensed from Mannin Research Inc:  The MAN-01 asset for treatment of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), is continuing to progress in its pre-clinical lead candidate optimization of a small molecule for a topical application.Mannin will continue with preclinical research and development activities for 2017 before progressing into IND enabling studies, expected in 2018 to be followed by first in human proof-of-concept clinical trials.Our efforts in establishing research and development partnerships with commercial partners, as well as government organizations to provide technical and financial support for the development of MAN-01 for POAG is ongoing. To this end, Mannin is continuing strategic partnership discussions with companies and technologies that will strengthen its intellectual property portfolio in the Tie2/TEK mechanism of action market.Thank you for your interest in Q BioMed and we hope you continue following our progress.Happy New Year and may it bring you good health, happiness and prosperity!Please visit our website http://www.qbiomed.com to sign up for regular updates and stay up-to-date with our progress. http://www.qbiomed.comAbout Q BioMed Inc. Q BioMed Inc."Q" is a biomedical acceleration and development company.

Finalizes License Agreement With Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology for Novel Liver Cancer TreatmentPR NewswireJune 15, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Q BioMed Inc. (QBIO), is very pleased to announce their entry into a final license agreement with The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB). Under the agreement QBioMed has the global exclusive rights to develop and market a novel chemotherapeutic drug to treat liver cancer.The compound was isolated and characterized from the leaves of Solanum nigrum Linn, or black nightshade, a plant widely used in traditional medicine.In animal models, the compound, called uttrocide B, was shown to be 10 times more cytotoxic to HepG2 liver cancer cells than the only drug currently on the market for the condition."Our ultimate goal is to use uttrocide B as a chemotherapeutic against liver cancer, which has very few therapeutic options," said Q BioMed, Inc., CEO Denis Corin.RGCB researchers identified the therapeutic effect of the compound and then entered into collaboration with OMRF to further develop and commercialize it. In animal models, uttrocide B was shown to be more potent than the currently available drug for the disease and caused no noticeable side effects."We are excited at the prospect of developing a drug that could address a significant unmet medical need and benefit patients", said Dr. M.R.Pillai, Director of RGCB.Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and claims approximately 750,000 lives each year. The American Cancer Society estimates that 39,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with primary liver cancer in 2017 and that 27,000 will die from the disease this year."This is truly an unmet need in liver cancer," said OMRF Vice President of Technology Ventures, Manu Nair. "To find a plant-based treatment for a condition like liver cancer can open the door to a wide variety of other natural products for treating human disease."Please visit http://www.qbiomed.com for more information and sign up to receive regular updates.

About us
A Few words to understand QBioMed













  Welcome to Q!



Q BioMed Inc. is a biomedical acceleration and development company. We are dedicated to acquiring and providing strategic resources and expansion capital to innovative healthcare companies that strive to provide much needed healthcare and related products to patients in need.
By partnering with exceptional entrepreneurs we aim to help to create market-leading products and companies in the biomedical and healthcare sector. As entrepreneurs and investors with operational and technical expertise we embrace a collaborative approach to capital formation and business development.




     





          Pipeline



We have identified several targets that could provide a substantial pipeline of innovative and high value assets. Q intends to maximize risk-adjusted returns by focusing on clinical stage and innovative products where the technical, regulatory, and commercial risks have been mitigated or major valuation inflections are imminent.




Growth



Q and its investors are positioned to benefit from early investment in illiquid and unknown private assets with multiple potential products in their development cycle and capitalize on valuation growth as they move forward.




          We expect success to be shared as multiple assets mature at different times in their development cycle passing on value to the Q BioMed shareholders."           Innovation



Q BioMed investors will have the opportunity to realize the value created from our strategic investment of resources into innovative bio-medical products that they may never have known about. These technologies are vetted by analysts, industry KOLs and experts. As a public company, Q BioMed gives investors public company liquidity without being tied up in a private company or a single biotech asset with unknown exit strategy and uncertain value inflection milestones. Q BioMed plans to mitigate risk by licensing or acquiring multiple assets across a broad spectrum of healthcare related products, companies and sectors. We expect these assets to be developed to provide significant cash returns via organic cash flow or out-licensing, sale or be spun out into new public companies.

The right firm
Q focuses exclusively in the biotechnology and healthcare sectors, targeting a broad spectrum of biomedical products and healthcare solutions. Q’s expertise is in business & product development and the capital formation required for phased advancement of products.


The right solution
Our team aims to assist companies by utilizing our investment partners and network of experts to provide public market access to private company assets.  80% of biomedical start ups lack capital and resources to transition from incubation to development and beyond.


The right strategy
Q expects to maximize risk-adjusted returns by focusing on value driven assets from early stage to near revenue businesses where the technical, regulatory, and commercial risks have been mitigated or where major valuation inflections are imminent.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
