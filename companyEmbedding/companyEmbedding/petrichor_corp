Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the
full $50,000 as anticipated.

Gross proceeds                 $25,000   $37,500   $50,000
Offering expenses            $   8,000 $   8,000 $   8,000
Net proceeds                 $  17,000 $  29,500 $  42,000
Purchase of office equipment $   2,000 $   2,500 $   3,000
Website development          $   4,000 $   4,000 $   5,000
Marketing and advertising    $   1,500 $  12,000 $  22,000
SEC reporting and compliance $  10,000 $  10,000 $  10,000
Miscellaneous expenses       $     500 $   1,000 $   2,000

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Liudmila Shokhina, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the
proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business
plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin
Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms. Shokhina will not be paid any compensation
or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Ms. Shokhina. Ms. Shokhina will be repaid
from revenues of operations if and when we generate significant revenues to pay
the obligation.


Petrichor Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to
date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many participants in
the business of human translation service. Many established, yet well financed
entities are currently active in the business of providing such services. Nearly
all Petrichor Corp.'s competitors have significantly greater financial
resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than Petrichor Corp.
We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide
such services and become a successful company in the web-based human translation
service. Therefore, Petrichor Corp. may not be able to establish itself within
the industry at all.

While we have plans for marketing and sales, there can be no assurance that such
efforts will be successful. There can be no assurance that our proposed services
will gain wide acceptance in its target market or that we will be able to
effectively market our services. Additionally, we are a newly-formed,
development stage company with no prior experience in our industry. We are
entirely dependent on the services of our sole officer and director, Liudmila
Shokhina, to build our customer base. Our company has no prior experience which
it can rely upon in order to garner its first prospective customers to use our
cervices.


Company Description
Petrichor Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 14, 2014.
We have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are a 
development-stage company formed to commence operations in the business of 
web-based human translation. As of today, we have registered our


 company, 
developed our business plan and registered a domain name for our web site. 

Petrichor Corp. hopes to position itself to take full advantage of the fast
growing Internet industry. It is our intent to have our web site completed
within the next 12 months after completing our public offering. It is our desire
to represent web-based human translation service on our website. Our concept
would allow anyone who has a mobile devise or computer and access to the
Internet to send us documents for translation from different languages. However,
there is no assurance that our website and our business will be ever developed
and our potential customers will use our human translation service.
---

Petrichor Corp. is online-only translation company. We plan to provide on-demand
human-translation services to businesses, individuals, and enterprises.
Web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals
that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent
inaccuracy of machine translations, we believe that human translation remains
the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available. While not
instantaneous like its machine counterparts such as Google Translate and Yahoo!
Babel Fish, web-based human translation has been gaining popularity by providing
relatively fast, accurate translation for business communications, legal
documents, medical records, and software localization. Web-based human
translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers.

To process any translation, human or automated, the meaning of a text in the
original (source) language must be fully restored in the target language, i.e.
the translation. While on the surface this seems straightforward, it is far more
complex. Translation is not a mere word-for-word substitution. A translator must
interpret and analyze all of the elements in the text and know how each word may
influence another. This requires extensive expertise in grammar, syntax
(sentence structure), semantics (meanings), etc., in the source and target
languages, as well as familiarity with each local region. With the emergence of
many PC and web-based translation applications, commonly known as Machine
Translation, it is no longer difficult to translate documents or websites from
one language into another. However, just because something is easy does not
necessarily make it the best option. Most of the world’s languages have evolved
over time, and as such there are occasions when an exact conversion of a single
word or phrase from one language to another is not possible. It is in these
circumstances that the machine translation software will fall short, using rules
rather than judgment, or equations instead of expertise.

We intend to build our freelancer translation team to be able to translate
different languages both from English and into English. To insure quality
translation, we plan to hire translators that worked as a professional
translator for over 5 years. Our goal is using technology to offer quality,
speed, and value translation of different documents from different languages.
Our planed turnaround time for translation is 24-48 hours depending on the
language and page count. We plan to develop our website in 3rd-5th month after
completion of this offering. Our website will allow our potential customers to
choose the languages for translation, upload the files for translation and pay
the order online. After the order is placed the document is reviewed and a
translator with relevant expertise will begin carefully working on the order.
The work will be then double checked for accuracy and the final product will be
sent back in an email.

We maintain our statutory registered agent's office at 2360 Corporate Circle, 
Suite 400, Henderson, Nevada 89074. Our business office is located at 18801 
Collins Ave., Ste. 102-252, Sunny Isles Beach, FL 33160. Our telephone number 
is (702) 605-0610.

Why Petrichor?

The idea started from a family farm in Africa within a landlocked country, relying on imports to operate a successful agricultural business. 
                     
                     In 2008 we purchased the first machine from an auction in the USA.
                      Complications of shipping and importing was a yet to come, but that was the challenge. Persistence paid off and the first mission was successful. Producing a product that was of the best quality and a fraction of the price compared to the used market prices in the area. 

An opportunity for the unknown route was created; thus from this family of farmers PETRICHOR was established.
                      Through being part of various trade mission and visits to the USA, we were introduced to leading dealers and have established very secure connections resulting in a solution found! 
Petrichor truly understands the challenges of communication and connection and we respect the importance of support, reliable sources and timing. Whether looking for something specific or in general, we help you find it.
