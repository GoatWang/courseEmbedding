Willie's Distillery







The Northern Rodeo Association is proud to welcome their newest partner, Willie’s Distillery.  Robin & Willie Blazer are the owners and founders of Willie’s Distillery, Inc. located in Ennis, MT.  They offer a diverse product line, Moonshine, Honey Moonshine, Whiskey, Brandy and Liqueurs.  Their ingredients are simple:  Montana grains, carefully selected yeast, pure, clean Montana water, and a good dose of heart and soul.  Sometimes they use Wild Montana Honey or Native Berries and Botanicals.  Clean, simple, perfect.  They use a copper pot still made specially for them by Bavarian Holstein Stills from Germany.  They knew they wanted to make whiskies and brandies, and a few specialty spirits, so they sought out one of the finest small batch stills in the world. Their still is handcrafted out of copper, and hand-hammered to create more surface area to react with their spirits vapors. Since they specialize in whiskey which has a lot of flavor to it, copper was an important element to the design, as it reacts with unpleasant tasting compounds, allowing the better flavor to shine through.  Willie’s Distillery’s mission is to make world class spirits for world class individuals.

          Willie's Distillery


Willie’s Distillery is a small batch distillery located on Main street in picturesque Ennis, Montana, on the banks of the fabled Madison River. Our mission is to make World Class Spirits for World Class Individuals.
We use fresh mountain water straight from the source, and find our grains and ingredients from small Montana farms and growers ranging from a local apiary to the barley fields of the Montana Highline. Each bottle is handled and filled with care.
They say the smaller the town, the more time slows down. We’re ok with that because you just can’t rush perfection.

                  About 


Our ingredients are simple:  High quality grains, carefully selected yeast, pure Montana water, and a good dose of heart and soul.  Sometimes we use wild Montana honey or native berries and botanicals.  
Clean, simple, perfect.

Robin grew up on a wheat farm near Toston, Montana, and Willie hails from Western North Carolina, in the heart of Appalachian moonshining country. Together, they searched for the perfect place to craft their spirits and settled on Ennis. They figured a more perfect place doesn’t exist. They wanted to live in a place most people only dream of – somewhere with pure, cold well water, a swiftly running fly-fishing stream, and surrounding majestic mountain ranges.
Robin & Willie Blazer are the owners and founders of Willie’s Distillery, Inc.

We use a copper pot still made specially for us by Bavarian Holstein Stills from Germany.
We knew we wanted to make whiskies and brandies, and a few specialty spirits, so we sought out one of the finest small batch stills in the world. Our still is handcrafted out of copper, and hand-hammered to create more surface area to react with our spirits vapors. Since we specialize in whiskey which has a lot of flavor to it, copper was an important element to the design, as it reacts with unpleasant tasting compounds, allowing the better flavor to shine through.

          Willie's Distillery


Willie’s Distillery is a small batch distillery located on Main street in picturesque Ennis, Montana, on the banks of the fabled Madison River. Our mission is to make World Class Spirits for World Class Individuals.
We use fresh mountain water straight from the source, and find our grains and ingredients from small Montana farms and growers ranging from a local apiary to the barley fields of the Montana Highline. Each bottle is handled and filled with care.
They say the smaller the town, the more time slows down. We’re ok with that because you just can’t rush perfection.
