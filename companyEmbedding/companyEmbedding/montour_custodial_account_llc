of 68results123NextMap ViewTips & AdviceWhat is a child custody schedule?A child custody schedule pertains to visitation rights, and might go into great detail as a court-ordered breakdown of when a child lives with and spends time with each parent. It is not uncommon for child custody schedules to be broken down by the hour, established months in advance.What is primary custody?Primary custody is the classification for the parent with whom the child spends the majority of their time in unequal joint physical custody distributions.What is joint custody?The legal definition may vary somewhat by state, but joint custody generally refers to a dynamic in which both parents retain physical custody rights after a divorce. This typically means the child spends time at two homes and, technically, has two different addresses.Can a child custody ruling be reversed?Yes, but in most states and jurisdictions, the “bar” for so-called abuse of discretion is high. In order to overturn a custody decision, the guardian in question must be proven to have violated specific terms of the agreement in a manner so egregious that the child was endangered or otherwise put at serious risk.What are the primary factors taken into consideration during custody cases?The foremost consideration is almost always a suitable living space for the child. Social services might inspect a home to ensure it meets certain standards for public health, in addition to providing a positive and loving environment. Beyond that, the court will look at the custodian in question’s less tangible connections with the child, particularly in third-party cases, to ensure they are providing the best possible care. Work history, income, personal health and any official legal records will all be taken into account. The opinions of the children, or child, also might be taken into account.Can someone other than a parent get custody of a child?Yes, in circumstances where neither parent is alive, available, or otherwise fit to care for the child, a relative or other legal guardian can win full custody, provided they display to the court “legal standing.” For a third party, that entails not only a suitable living space, but also sufficient connection to and involvement in the child’s life.What is the difference between the legal and physical custody of a child?Physical custody means the child lives, either full or part-time, with that parent. In essence, a parent with legal but not physical custody rights will have visitation privileges as well as a right to be involved in decisions directly affecting the child, such as where they go to school.How much does it cost to file for child support?Child support payments are generally dictated by the net income of the non-custodial parent, but in conjunction with the earnings of the custodial parent. The payment model will then determine the non-custodial parent’s obligation based on their percentage of the total earnings. For example, if a non-custodial parent earns about $2,000 per month out of $4,500, the court might use an economic table based on average child-raising costs to determine the former’s payments to be around $1,000 per month.How much does it cost to hire a child custody attorney?Different attorneys and their firms will structure billing differently, but if they’re charging a flat fee, it usually starts at around $3,000 and can cost as much as $6,000. Hourly fees range anywhere from $100- $400. Some firms might ask for a retainer, and still others might work out alternative payment plans for families with fixed incomes. It’s worth noting a lower fee does not necessarily indicate lower quality service, but rather a representation of what the attorney expects the case to cost them in time and resources.What type of attorney handles child custody cases?Most child custody lawyers specialize in that area of expertise, but some might position themselves more broadly as family litigators. What’s most important is for the client to seek answers to the questions pertaining directly to their case, and feel comfortably with the attorney’s qualifications, experience and ability to address their specific needs.See more Tips & AdviceSponsoredDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glass

  Give a gift for the future  Learn more about how custodial accounts can help provide a simple solution to transfer and invest money for a child’s future. 





A custodial account can be a simple route to a future goal. Custodial accounts let parents, grandparents, and others transfer and invest money for a minor. The accounts offer tax benefits and the flexibility to use funds for educational or non-educational expenses.  What is a custodial account?

 For children younger than age 19 (or 24 for a full-time student), the first $1,000 of earnings qualifies for the standard deduction.  The next $1,000 in earnings is taxed at the minor’s tax rate.  If the dependent child’s account earns more than $2,000, the excess is taxed at the higher of the parents’ top marginal rate or the child’s own rate.  These “kiddie tax” rules do not affect children who are 18 or older and provide more than half of their own support (based on their own earned income).    Investment and Insurance Products:  Are Not insured by the FDIC or any other federal government agency Are Not deposits of or guaranteed by a Bank May Lose Value   Brokerage products and services are offered through Wells Fargo Advisors.

        Commentary: Beware of legal and tax complications
    















By

                                        BillBischoff







Parents set up custodial accounts for children for various reasons, some legitimate and some not. Aunt Gertrude gives $10,000 to little Johnny: set up a custodial account to hold the money. Parents want a tax shelter for little Stephanie’s college savings fund: set up a custodial account to invest the dough until college time. Single Mom wants to hide some cash so she can qualify for financial aid and go back to school: move the money into a child’s custodial account and take it back later. You get the idea. The problem: many parents fail to recognize that custodial accounts have significant legal and tax implications. Here are the five most important things to understand.  1. That Money Isn’t Yours Anymore 




Irina Schmidt / Shutterstock.com





When funds are transferred into a minor child’s custodial account at a financial institution or brokerage firm, the funds now irrevocably belong to that child. While the parent can, and usually does, function as the custodian (manager) of the account, the money can legally be used only for expenditures that benefit that child. In other words, parents are legally forbidden from using custodial account money for expenditures that benefit themselves (like a new car). And you can’t take money from one kid’s custodial account and use it to open up or supplement an account for another kid. Obviously, it can be a fine line between expenditures that benefit the child and those that benefit other family members. And I’ve never personally heard of a parent getting into legal hot water for raiding a custodial account. That said, staying on the right side of the law is the right thing to do.   2. Your Kid Will Gain Control at a Young Age  A minor child’s custodial account must be established under your state’s Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA). Under applicable state law (most states have UTMA regimes these days), your child will gain full legal control over the account once he or she ceases to be a minor. This will happen somewhere between age 18 and 21 (in most states it’s 21). Remember: nice little kids can turn into obnoxious teenagers, and young adults are not necessarily much better. So consider the possibility of future “UGMA or UTMA regret” before taking the irrevocable step of putting money into a child’s custodial account.   3. Your Kid May Have to File Tax Returns and Pay Taxes  Any income from your child’s custodial account belongs to the child. If that income exceeds $1,000 (for 2013), a separate federal income tax return generally must be filed for the child using Form 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ. The child will probably owe some tax, and the Kiddie Tax rules may make it higher (see below). A state income tax return may be required too.  Exception: If all of your child’s income consists of interest, dividends, and mutual fund capital gains distributions, you may qualify to simply include the income on your Form 1040 and pay the resulting extra tax with your return. For details on this simplifying option, see IRS Form 8814 (Parents’ Election to Report Child’s Interest and Dividends) at www.irs.gov.   4. The Kiddie Tax Could Bite 







It would be swell if children with substantial custodial accounts were allowed to pay the same tax rates on investment income as other unmarried individuals. If that was allowed to happen, a child’s 2013 ordinary income would typically be taxed at a federal rate of only 10% or 15%, and a 0% rate would typically apply to long-term capital gains and dividends. Unfortunately, our beloved Congress created the so-called Kiddie Tax to prevent such happy outcomes. Under the Kiddie Tax rules, a minor child’s investment income above $2,000 (for 2013) may be taxed at the parent’s higher rates. So the federal rate on a child’s interest income could be as high as 39.6%, and long-term gains and dividends could be taxed at up to 20%. The Kiddie Tax is calculated on IRS Form 8615 (Tax for Certain Children Who Have Investment Income of More Than $2,000) or on the aforementioned Form 8814 (when allowed).  Bottom Line: In the good old days, a custodial account could function as an efficient tax shelter because the income was taxed at the child’s low rates. These days, the Kiddie Tax rules make it difficult for custodial accounts to deliver meaningful tax savings.   5. There Might Be Gift Tax Consequences  For 2013, you can take advantage of the annual federal gift tax exclusion to move up to $14,000 into a custodial account for each of your children. So can your spouse. You can do the same thing next year, and the year after that, and so on. Gifts up to the $14,000 annual limit don’t reduce your lifetime $5.25 million federal gift tax exemption. That’s good! However if you transfer more than $14,000, you must file a gift tax return on IRS Form 709 (United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return). You probably won’t actually owe any gift tax (thanks to the $5.25 million exemption), but you still have to file the form.   The Last Word  Custodial accounts are not as simple as advertised, and there’s even more to the story than I’ve told you here. For example, a healthy custodial account balance can reduce college financial aid awards. One good source for additional info is www.fairmark.com/custacct/.

About Us - Montour Industrial Supply












































1-800-970-0694412-262-7460



Proudly Calling Pittsburgh Home Since 1948 
















About Us Since 1948, The Montour Group has been providing exceptional customer service to thousands of customers in the Tri-State area and across the country. The company was originally founded as a retail hardware store in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. As our modest company grew over the next five decades, individuals and corporations alike began to depend on the extensive inventory and dedicated service we provided.
In 1995, recognizing a need to drastically expand our capabilities into the world of industrial pipe, valves and fittings, Montour Industrial Supply opened a separate facility. The immediate response was so positive that within four years we moved into our current location with a 100,000 square foot fully enclosed warehouse and expanded the inventory to fill the building and customer needs. With the warehouse we are able to stage and tag orders to customer specifications. Since establishing residence in the Second Avenue facilities in 1999, Montour Industrial Supply has flourished. With the combined inventories of Montour Industrial Supply and Montour Hardware we are more than the average supply house. Montour is a full service supply house for all aspects of your construction projects.
The goal of our dedicated outside sales staff is to leave no stone unturned in any industrial, mechanical or institutional account in the Tri-State area. The full-time members of our inside sales team have the full support of the clerical staff striving to satisfy every customer’s requests. The warehouse management, staff, and drivers are an intricate part of the organization, ensuring that each and every customer’s needs are met. This includes local delivery to your job site or door step in Southwestern Pennsylvania, Northern West Virginia, or Eastern Ohio. Montour takes pride in 100% customer satisfaction from the minute you make your first call to the office until your job is complete. No job is too big or too small.
Working with the support of our established vendors, Montour Industrial Supply has and will always be able to furnish your material needs, either from our inventory or manufacturing a custom designed product to suit your needs. It is important to us to include our vendors and manufacturers in our daily functions. We feel it is vital for our success as a distributor that quality products and exemplary service be provided to our customers as a package.
Contact us for information about vendor stocking of products, as well as “lunch & learn” opportunities that we host with manufacturer representatives.

Tab Two

Why a custodial  account may be right for you 
The Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) are custodial accounts that allow you to invest in a college education or any other expense that benefits a child. Funds in the account are considered an irrevocable gift that becomes a child's assets once they reach vesting age.
 






What are the benefits of a custodial account?


Funds can be used for any purpose as long as it benefits a child (no penalty if the assets aren't used for college)
You can pass money to a child once they reach the vesting age
Can be funded with cash or securities
Anyone can contribute on behalf of a child




What are the tax advantages of a custodial account?

In 2017, the first $1,050 of a child's income generally is tax-exempt, the next $1,050 of unearned income generally is taxed at the child's tax rate, and unearned income over $2,100 generally is taxed at the parent's tax rate if the child is under age 19 (or is a full-time student under age 24) at the end of the year.


What are the investment choices for a custodial account?

Access a full range of investments choices, including: stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bonds and thousands of well-known mutual funds. 


Who controls a custodial account?

The account is owned by a custodian until the child inherits the assets upon vesting age. Beneficiaries cannot be changed because contributions into the account are considered an irrevocable gift.


How much can I contribute to a custodial account?

There's no limit to the amount you can contribute. And there's no age limit for making contributions and withdrawals, but account ownership will be transferred to the minor upon vesting age. You can contribute up to the annual gifting limits of $14,000 (or $28,000 for couples) annually gift tax-free.


Can anyone else contribute to a custodial account?

Anyone can contribute to a custodial account, including family members and friends.


How will this account type impact financial aid?

Custodial accounts are treated as a child's asset and can reduce their ability to get financial aid.  The impact is less favorable than that of assets held in a Section 529 or Coverdell Education Savings Account.

Neither Merrill Lynch nor any of its affiliates or financial advisors provide legal, tax or accounting advice. You should consult your legal and/or tax advisors before making any financial decisions.  
1 Other fees may apply. Sales are subject to a transaction fee of between $0.01 and $0.03 per $1,000 of principal. There are costs associated with owning ETFs. To learn more about Merrill Edge pricing, visit merrilledge.com/pricing.  
2 For 2017, contributions can be made up to the federal gift-tax exclusion limit of $14,000 per beneficiary per year ($28,000 for married couples) without incurring federal gift taxes or generation-skipping transfer tax. You can take advantage of a forward gifting provision that allows you to contribute up to $70,000 ($140,000 for married couples filing jointly) per beneficiary in a single year without incurring gift tax. Contributions between $14,000 and $70,000 ($28,000 and $140,000 for married couples filing jointly) made in one year can be prorated over a five-year period without subjecting you to gift tax or reducing your federal unified estate and gift tax credit. If you contribute less than the $70,000 ($140,000 for married couples filing jointly) maximum, additional contributions can be made without you being subject to federal gift tax, up to a prorated level of $14,000 ($28,000 for married couples filing jointly) per year. Gift taxation may result if a contribution exceeds the available annual gift tax exclusion amount remaining for a given beneficiary in the year of contribution. For contributions between $14,000 and $70,000 ($28,000 and $140,000 for married couples filing jointly) made in one year, if the account owner dies before the end of the five-year period, a prorated portion of the contribution may be included in his or her estate for estate tax purposes. Please consult your tax and/or legal advisor for such guidance.  
3 Merrill Edge Roadmap® participation requires a Merrill Edge Advisory Center™ account.  
4 You have choices for what to do with your employer sponsored retirement plan. Depending on your financial circumstances, needs and goals, you may choose to roll over to an IRA or convert to a Roth, roll over to an employer sponsored plan from a prior employer to an employer sponsored plan at your new employer, take a distribution or leave the account where it is. Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments. These are complex choices and should be considered with care. Visit http://www.merrilledge.com/retirement/rollover-ira or call a Merrill Edge rollover specialist at 1.888.637.3343 for additional information about your choices.
