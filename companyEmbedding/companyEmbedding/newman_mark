                            Mark Newman, interior designer and artist started his residential home furnishings collection in 1991 as Newman Studio. 
                            In 2012, on his company's 20 year anniversary, Newman Studio became Mark Newman, Inc. with a new look and 20 new products.

                            Originally conceived as a 'To The Trade' only product line, Mark Newman furniture can now be purchased by anyone. All products are made to order. Please allow 10-12 weeks to complete your order.

                            Mark brings his unique esthetic to interiors and product design evolving over the past two decades. Drawing from a passion for art, design and architecture, Mark produces an ever changing collection of original bench made furniture with the right scale, detailing, function and quality that comes with years of design experience.

Our group conducts research on the structure and function of networks,
particularly social and information networks, which we study using a
combination of empirical methods, analysis, and computer simulation.  Among
other things, we have investigated scientific coauthorship networks,
citation networks, email networks, friendship networks, epidemiological
contact networks, and animal social networks; we've studied fundamental
network properties such as degree distributions, centrality measures,
assortative mixing, vertex similarity, and community structure, and made
analytic or computer models of disease propagation, friendship formation,
the spread of computer viruses, the Internet, and network navigation.

Our recent work on generalized communities in networks was featured on the cover of
Physical Review Letters.



 My book
Networks: An Introduction was published in 2010 by Oxford University
Press.  Information about it is here.  The Amazon
page is also a good place to look for info.



With Daniel Dorling and Anna
Barford, we have a new book of maps available, The Atlas of the Real
World, containing 366 cartograms showing all kinds of different
features of the world today.



Our work on
density-equalizing map projections appeared on the cover of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.



The web site accompanying my book Computational Physics is here.
The Worldmapper Project collection of cartograms is here.
A collection of network data sets from various sources is here.  Data sets
include the Zachary karate club and US college football networks that have
been widely used as tests for community structure algorithms, and a number
of coauthorship networks.

Description
By far the rarest reference of all Daytonas, the 6240 is a transitional model that introduced the screw down chronograph pushers case. While the later screw down pusher references 6263 and 6265 abound, the 6240 is a very rare watch. This watch ups the ante with its original two color “Panda” Paul Newman dial. Further still, this is the rare Mark 1 dial and the case has its original fat pushers. Original case is stainless steel with dimensions of 37.5mm diameter by 12.5mm thick. Acrylic crystal. First series oversized original screw down chronograph pushers. Original winding crown. Original bezel has “Units per Hour” scale from ‘50’ to ‘200’. Inside caseback is stamped ‘6240’.Serial number 1439XXX dates production to 1965. Original untouched two color Paul Newman “Panda” dial is white with contrasting black subdials. Original dial and hands are in perfect condition. Original movement is the manual winding Rolex Caliber 722 with 17 jewels. This caliber features column wheel construction – by far the superior chronograph caliber construction ever made. Movement is in great condition and is running strong. Bracelet is Rolex Oyster 78350 with 12 links. This is an all original and rare first series vintage Rolex Cosmograph Daytona 6240 with original Mark I two color Paul Newman dial. Watch is in mint+ condition and guaranteed original.
