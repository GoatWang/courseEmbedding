Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Municipal Bond Trust’s (BBK) (the 'Trust') investment objective is to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax. The Trust
seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal bonds exempt from regular federal income taxes (except that the interest may
be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax). The Trust invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its assets in municipal bonds that
are investment grade quality. The Trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

Missing calendar year returns data 






The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.






Growth of Hypothetical $10,000 The growth of hypothetical $10,000 chart reflects a hypothetical $10,000 investment and assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses were deducted.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Portfolio Characteristics 

 
Portfolio Characteristics 



Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

as of 21-Jul-2017



8.55%




Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

as of 30-Jun-2017

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

Ratings

 Ratings



Morningstar Rating

Overall Municipal Bond Trust received a Morningstar Rating of 4 stars for the 3-year period, 4 stars for the 5-year period and 4 stars for the 10-year period, rated against 64, 60 and 56 Muni National Long Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust ("BBN" or the "Trust") investment objective is to seek high current income, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Trust invests at least 80% of its managed assets in taxable municipal securities, which include Build America Bonds. The Trust also has the ability to invest up to 20% of its managed assets in securities other than taxable municipal securities. Such other securities include tax-exempt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities and corporate bonds issued by issuers that have, in the investment adviser's view, typically been associated with or sold in the municipal market, such as bonds issued by private universities and hospitals, or bonds sold to finance military housing developments. No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Premium/Discount
The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Portfolio Characteristics 



Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Maryland Municipal Bond Trust’s (BZM) (the 'Trust') investment objective is to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
taxes and Maryland personal income taxes. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in municipal bonds exempt from
federal income taxes (except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax) and Maryland personal income taxes. The Trust
invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its assets in municipal bonds that are investment grade quality at the time of investment. The
Trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.


 
The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted, and numbers may reflect small variances due to rounding. Standardized performance and performance data current to the most recent month end may be found in the Performance section.

Premium/Discount
The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's Portfolio - BlackRock Build America Bond Trust (NYSE:BBN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's PortfolioJul.20.17 | About: BlackRock Build (BBN) David Hsu Special situations, long only, bonds, Deep ValueSummaryBlackrock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust is the largest closed-end mutual fund specializing in Build America Bonds.Public sources, including CEFConnect, Morningstar, and BlackRock, have confusing data about key portfolio characteristics such as yield to maturity, duration, and bond price.I calculate the yield to maturity, bond price, and effective duration for each of the 134 bonds in BBN's portfolio and provide a worksheet.BlackRock Taxable Municipal America Bond Trust (BBN) is the largest and highest-yielding closed-end mutual fund that specializes in Build America Bonds, a special class of taxable municipal securities issued pursuant to the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In an earlier article (“Build America Bonds: the Impact of Yield Chasing”), I warned about the potential risks to these funds due to low net asset value discount and high interest rate sensitivity. In this article, I show that for the average investor, finding disclosure about some of the key bond-related metrics can be confusing due to the rather limited and non-standardized disclosures required of closed-end bond funds. So let’s see what different data sources report on key risk and yield metrics for BBN. CEFConnect And Morningstar First, let’s look at CEFConnect. Under the tab “Portfolio Characteristics,” it reports an Average Coupon of 10.60%, Average Maturity of 34.36 years, but sadly no YTM. Interestingly enough, neither Average Coupon nor Average Maturity look right, which we’ll get to later. 

 Source: CEFConnect website. Next, let’s try Morningstar. Under the “Portfolio” tab, we can see a weighted average coupon of “7” (sorry, folks, no decimals reported here), and weighted average bond price of $119. Sadly, there is no mention of yield to maturity.
 

 For duration, they report an unadjusted duration of 7.30 years, and a leverage adjusted duration of 11.62 years. So these are starting to look more plausible, but let’s investigate further. 

Source: Morningstar BlackRock BlackRock provides a fact sheet and a website summary. First, at their website, we found the following as of July 19. Here, they show YTM of 6.51%, average coupon of 10.17%, weighted average maturity of 32.24 years, and effective duration of 11.07 years. 

Source: Blackrock website BlackRock’s latest fact sheet is from March 2017 and can be found at this link. The second page shows portfolio characteristics including yield to maturity of 6.85%, effective duration of 10.97 years, and weighted average life [WAL] to worst of 24.23 years (it looks like they mistakenly labeled this as a percentage). 


 Below is my summary of what the various data sources list for maturity, duration, and YTM:   Source Maturity (NYSE:Y) Duration (Y) YTM (%) Coupon (%) Bond Price   CEFConnect 34.36     10.60     Morningstar 34.36 11.62   7 119   BlackRock website 32.24 11.07 6.51       BlackRock factsheet 24.23 10.97 6.85       Deep Dive Into BBN Holdings After reading these different data sources, something didn’t look right to me. First, CEFConnect’s coupon looked too high. In the 2008-2009 time period when the BABs were being offered to the market, most were paying coupons in the 6% to 7% range at issuance. There were a few higher rate, but those would not have been enough to move the average coupon over 10%. Second, the yield to maturity looked high. A quick scan of some Build America Bond CUSIPs indicated that individual bond YTMs were clustered in the high 4s to low 6s, so I didn’t think that a weighted average portfolio of these type of bonds could reach 6.85%. Two phone calls to BlackRock did not help clarify matters, as the phone representatives read from a script along the lines of: Yield to maturity is calculated as the discount rate that sets the present value of the bond’s future cash flows equal to its market price. For bonds that are callable, we used the yield to worst. I have to say, they train them for consistency at BlackRock, as I got the same speech from both representatives. Unfortunately, they were unable to answer questions about how a portfolio YTM could be higher than the component bond YTMs. So I decided to verify this for myself. As the different data sources varied, I figured the only way to convince myself of the YTM and duration was to look at each of the 134 individual holdings listed in their portfolio. I used the latest semiannual report from January 31, 2017, as the main data source. In that report, they helpfully report details about the issuer, coupon rate, maturity, par value, and market value for each of the 134 distinct bond holdings in the BBN portfolio. An example follows below:
 

 Source: Sample information from Blackrock BBN semi-annual report. Armed with this information, one can calculate duration and YTM. The bond’s yield to maturity can be calculated using Excel’s YIELD function, and the duration can be calculated using the MDURATION function. So I entered all 134 holdings into excel and calculated the price, YTM and duration for each of their holdings. The results are pictured below, and I make my excel sheet available on my OneDrive. 

Source: BBN semi-annual report January 31, 2017 and author’s calculations. Using market-value-based weightings (par value and duration weightings are very similar), I get an average coupon of 6.47%, WAL of 24.8 years, average bond price of $118, YTM of 5.19%, and a duration of 12.6 years. These numbers look more in line with the current prices and yields in the Build America Bond market. Analysis of BBN Distributions The current gross income of the BBN portfolio is $110 million a year. This is calculated using the average coupon rate of 6.41% times' par value of $1.726 billion. The net asset value is $1.3 billion ($2 billion in gross market value less $704 million in short-term loans), which means the gross investment income yield is 8.52%. Management fees are $12.6 million (0.91% of NAV), and interest expense is running at about $7 million (0.54% of NAV). This results in net investment income of $91 million a year, or about 7%, which compares very favorably to the 7.06% distribution in their factsheet.
 

 Future Amortization Of Premium Due to the lower interest rate environment compared to 2009-2010, most of the bonds in BBN’s portfolio are selling at a premium. I calculated a weighted average premium of 18%. Assuming that this premium is amortized over the weighted average life of 24.8 years, this is an erosion of 0.72% in the gross bond value every year. Because of the 35% leverage, this translates to a 1.12% a year decline in the NAV as these bonds will trend towards par as they approach maturity. Interest Rate Risks And Impact Of Leverage If the true YTM of the portfolio is 6.85%, then this looks like a low-risk and sustainable distribution. But the portfolio is not really a $1.3 billion portfolio of bonds with a 6.85% YTM. BBN is actually $2 billion of bonds with a 5.2% YTM and a $700 million loan, which is currently costing them 1%. Consider a scenario where long-term rates stay the same (so the value of the municipal bonds doesn’t change) but short-term cost of borrowing increases from 1% to 3%. Now the interest cost goes to $21 million or 1.62% of NAV. Now the distributable net income rate is 5.92%. This drop in income can happen in a situation where there is no change in long-term bond rates, where all the rising rates are on near-term debt (illustration below). 

 Finally, let’s consider a case of a 50bp increase in long-term rates, which leads to a decline in value of the overall bonds of 6.3% (using my calculated 12.6 year duration). In this illustration, there is no change in income, as the short-term rates have been kept constant at 1%, and only long-term rates increased by 0.5% leading to a price impact. This leads to a 6.3% drop in the gross value of the portfolio, which is a 9.7% drop in the NAV.
 

 Call Risk Though I am not an expert on the call characteristics of the individual bonds in BBN’s portfolio, a commenter on my other article pointed out several Build America Bonds that had been called. This is an additional risk to BBN, as premium bonds that are called are only paid their par value. BlackRock reports that 33% of their bonds are callable in the next 5 years, with a total of 40% of the bond portfolio subject to calls anytime in their lifetime. 

 Conclusion Bonds are complicated, and closed-end bond funds such as BBN even more so. Unfortunately, mandatory disclosures by closed-end funds are not particularly effective at communicating the risk characteristics of their portfolio in ways that are easily understood. Closed-end bond funds disclose data on net asset value, NAV discount, and distribution yield in fairly reliable and standardized formats. However, for closed-end funds that specialize in bonds, the disclosure about key variables of yield to maturity, bond premium, and duration has not been effectively standardized in the industry, so it can be more challenging to understand the risk characteristics of the bond fund. In the specific case of BBN, the largest Build America Bond closed-end mutual fund, we can see that the reported Yield to Maturity is much higher than the weighted average yield to maturity of the individual bonds. This is likely to do with how BlackRock deals with leverage, though I must admit that the specifics of their math escapes me.
 In terms of what this means for my investment thesis on BBN, I reiterate the views of my earlier article as follows:  Built-in slow but steady drag on NAV due to amortization of bond price premium, price risk due to long duration and leverage, no buffer from discount to NAV, and  potential distribution cut due to rising short-term borrowing rates (this is a new bonus worry after my deep-dive analysis).  Now, I want to make a point that I think that BlackRock has done a fine job with the construction of BBN's portfolio, paying a manageable distribution from net investment income, and providing pretty good information about the details of their portfolio. I know, because I owned BBN from late 2013 to last week and received lots of high distributions (started at almost 9% if I remember correctly) and a capital gain of 27% as a nice bonus. Where there is room for improvement is for more disclosure on the bond premiums, gross yield to maturity and duration (before leverage), and cost of leverage and hedging practices. This information can provide more insight, especially in markets where interest rate markets are starting to turn.

 Source: CEFConnect website. Next, let’s try Morningstar. Under the “Portfolio” tab, we can see a weighted average coupon of “7” (sorry, folks, no decimals reported here), and weighted average bond price of $119. Sadly, there is no mention of yield to maturity.
 

 For duration, they report an unadjusted duration of 7.30 years, and a leverage adjusted duration of 11.62 years. So these are starting to look more plausible, but let’s investigate further. 

Source: Morningstar BlackRock BlackRock provides a fact sheet and a website summary. First, at their website, we found the following as of July 19. Here, they show YTM of 6.51%, average coupon of 10.17%, weighted average maturity of 32.24 years, and effective duration of 11.07 years. 

Source: Blackrock website BlackRock’s latest fact sheet is from March 2017 and can be found at this link. The second page shows portfolio characteristics including yield to maturity of 6.85%, effective duration of 10.97 years, and weighted average life [WAL] to worst of 24.23 years (it looks like they mistakenly labeled this as a percentage). 


 Below is my summary of what the various data sources list for maturity, duration, and YTM:   Source Maturity (NYSE:Y) Duration (Y) YTM (%) Coupon (%) Bond Price   CEFConnect 34.36     10.60     Morningstar 34.36 11.62   7 119   BlackRock website 32.24 11.07 6.51       BlackRock factsheet 24.23 10.97 6.85       Deep Dive Into BBN Holdings After reading these different data sources, something didn’t look right to me. First, CEFConnect’s coupon looked too high. In the 2008-2009 time period when the BABs were being offered to the market, most were paying coupons in the 6% to 7% range at issuance. There were a few higher rate, but those would not have been enough to move the average coupon over 10%. Second, the yield to maturity looked high. A quick scan of some Build America Bond CUSIPs indicated that individual bond YTMs were clustered in the high 4s to low 6s, so I didn’t think that a weighted average portfolio of these type of bonds could reach 6.85%. Two phone calls to BlackRock did not help clarify matters, as the phone representatives read from a script along the lines of: Yield to maturity is calculated as the discount rate that sets the present value of the bond’s future cash flows equal to its market price. For bonds that are callable, we used the yield to worst. I have to say, they train them for consistency at BlackRock, as I got the same speech from both representatives. Unfortunately, they were unable to answer questions about how a portfolio YTM could be higher than the component bond YTMs. So I decided to verify this for myself. As the different data sources varied, I figured the only way to convince myself of the YTM and duration was to look at each of the 134 individual holdings listed in their portfolio. I used the latest semiannual report from January 31, 2017, as the main data source. In that report, they helpfully report details about the issuer, coupon rate, maturity, par value, and market value for each of the 134 distinct bond holdings in the BBN portfolio. An example follows below:
 

 Source: Sample information from Blackrock BBN semi-annual report. Armed with this information, one can calculate duration and YTM. The bond’s yield to maturity can be calculated using Excel’s YIELD function, and the duration can be calculated using the MDURATION function. So I entered all 134 holdings into excel and calculated the price, YTM and duration for each of their holdings. The results are pictured below, and I make my excel sheet available on my OneDrive. 

Source: BBN semi-annual report January 31, 2017 and author’s calculations. Using market-value-based weightings (par value and duration weightings are very similar), I get an average coupon of 6.47%, WAL of 24.8 years, average bond price of $118, YTM of 5.19%, and a duration of 12.6 years. These numbers look more in line with the current prices and yields in the Build America Bond market. Analysis of BBN Distributions The current gross income of the BBN portfolio is $110 million a year. This is calculated using the average coupon rate of 6.41% times' par value of $1.726 billion. The net asset value is $1.3 billion ($2 billion in gross market value less $704 million in short-term loans), which means the gross investment income yield is 8.52%. Management fees are $12.6 million (0.91% of NAV), and interest expense is running at about $7 million (0.54% of NAV). This results in net investment income of $91 million a year, or about 7%, which compares very favorably to the 7.06% distribution in their factsheet.
 

 Future Amortization Of Premium Due to the lower interest rate environment compared to 2009-2010, most of the bonds in BBN’s portfolio are selling at a premium. I calculated a weighted average premium of 18%. Assuming that this premium is amortized over the weighted average life of 24.8 years, this is an erosion of 0.72% in the gross bond value every year. Because of the 35% leverage, this translates to a 1.12% a year decline in the NAV as these bonds will trend towards par as they approach maturity. Interest Rate Risks And Impact Of Leverage If the true YTM of the portfolio is 6.85%, then this looks like a low-risk and sustainable distribution. But the portfolio is not really a $1.3 billion portfolio of bonds with a 6.85% YTM. BBN is actually $2 billion of bonds with a 5.2% YTM and a $700 million loan, which is currently costing them 1%. Consider a scenario where long-term rates stay the same (so the value of the municipal bonds doesn’t change) but short-term cost of borrowing increases from 1% to 3%. Now the interest cost goes to $21 million or 1.62% of NAV. Now the distributable net income rate is 5.92%. This drop in income can happen in a situation where there is no change in long-term bond rates, where all the rising rates are on near-term debt (illustration below). 

 Finally, let’s consider a case of a 50bp increase in long-term rates, which leads to a decline in value of the overall bonds of 6.3% (using my calculated 12.6 year duration). In this illustration, there is no change in income, as the short-term rates have been kept constant at 1%, and only long-term rates increased by 0.5% leading to a price impact. This leads to a 6.3% drop in the gross value of the portfolio, which is a 9.7% drop in the NAV.
 

 Call Risk Though I am not an expert on the call characteristics of the individual bonds in BBN’s portfolio, a commenter on my other article pointed out several Build America Bonds that had been called. This is an additional risk to BBN, as premium bonds that are called are only paid their par value. BlackRock reports that 33% of their bonds are callable in the next 5 years, with a total of 40% of the bond portfolio subject to calls anytime in their lifetime. 

 Conclusion Bonds are complicated, and closed-end bond funds such as BBN even more so. Unfortunately, mandatory disclosures by closed-end funds are not particularly effective at communicating the risk characteristics of their portfolio in ways that are easily understood. Closed-end bond funds disclose data on net asset value, NAV discount, and distribution yield in fairly reliable and standardized formats. However, for closed-end funds that specialize in bonds, the disclosure about key variables of yield to maturity, bond premium, and duration has not been effectively standardized in the industry, so it can be more challenging to understand the risk characteristics of the bond fund. In the specific case of BBN, the largest Build America Bond closed-end mutual fund, we can see that the reported Yield to Maturity is much higher than the weighted average yield to maturity of the individual bonds. This is likely to do with how BlackRock deals with leverage, though I must admit that the specifics of their math escapes me.
 In terms of what this means for my investment thesis on BBN, I reiterate the views of my earlier article as follows:  Built-in slow but steady drag on NAV due to amortization of bond price premium, price risk due to long duration and leverage, no buffer from discount to NAV, and  potential distribution cut due to rising short-term borrowing rates (this is a new bonus worry after my deep-dive analysis).  Now, I want to make a point that I think that BlackRock has done a fine job with the construction of BBN's portfolio, paying a manageable distribution from net investment income, and providing pretty good information about the details of their portfolio. I know, because I owned BBN from late 2013 to last week and received lots of high distributions (started at almost 9% if I remember correctly) and a capital gain of 27% as a nice bonus. Where there is room for improvement is for more disclosure on the bond premiums, gross yield to maturity and duration (before leverage), and cost of leverage and hedging practices. This information can provide more insight, especially in markets where interest rate markets are starting to turn.

A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's Portfolio - BlackRock Build America Bond Trust (NYSE:BBN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»A Deep Dive Into BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust's PortfolioJul.20.17 | About: BlackRock Build (BBN) David Hsu Special situations, long only, bonds, Deep ValueSummaryBlackrock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust is the largest closed-end mutual fund specializing in Build America Bonds.Public sources, including CEFConnect, Morningstar, and BlackRock, have confusing data about key portfolio characteristics such as yield to maturity, duration, and bond price.I calculate the yield to maturity, bond price, and effective duration for each of the 134 bonds in BBN's portfolio and provide a worksheet.BlackRock Taxable Municipal America Bond Trust (BBN) is the largest and highest-yielding closed-end mutual fund that specializes in Build America Bonds, a special class of taxable municipal securities issued pursuant to the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In an earlier article (“Build America Bonds: the Impact of Yield Chasing”), I warned about the potential risks to these funds due to low net asset value discount and high interest rate sensitivity. In this article, I show that for the average investor, finding disclosure about some of the key bond-related metrics can be confusing due to the rather limited and non-standardized disclosures required of closed-end bond funds. So let’s see what different data sources report on key risk and yield metrics for BBN. CEFConnect And Morningstar First, let’s look at CEFConnect. Under the tab “Portfolio Characteristics,” it reports an Average Coupon of 10.60%, Average Maturity of 34.36 years, but sadly no YTM. Interestingly enough, neither Average Coupon nor Average Maturity look right, which we’ll get to later. 

 Source: CEFConnect website. Next, let’s try Morningstar. Under the “Portfolio” tab, we can see a weighted average coupon of “7” (sorry, folks, no decimals reported here), and weighted average bond price of $119. Sadly, there is no mention of yield to maturity.
 

 For duration, they report an unadjusted duration of 7.30 years, and a leverage adjusted duration of 11.62 years. So these are starting to look more plausible, but let’s investigate further. 

Source: Morningstar BlackRock BlackRock provides a fact sheet and a website summary. First, at their website, we found the following as of July 19. Here, they show YTM of 6.51%, average coupon of 10.17%, weighted average maturity of 32.24 years, and effective duration of 11.07 years. 

Source: Blackrock website BlackRock’s latest fact sheet is from March 2017 and can be found at this link. The second page shows portfolio characteristics including yield to maturity of 6.85%, effective duration of 10.97 years, and weighted average life [WAL] to worst of 24.23 years (it looks like they mistakenly labeled this as a percentage). 


 Below is my summary of what the various data sources list for maturity, duration, and YTM:   Source Maturity (NYSE:Y) Duration (Y) YTM (%) Coupon (%) Bond Price   CEFConnect 34.36     10.60     Morningstar 34.36 11.62   7 119   BlackRock website 32.24 11.07 6.51       BlackRock factsheet 24.23 10.97 6.85       Deep Dive Into BBN Holdings After reading these different data sources, something didn’t look right to me. First, CEFConnect’s coupon looked too high. In the 2008-2009 time period when the BABs were being offered to the market, most were paying coupons in the 6% to 7% range at issuance. There were a few higher rate, but those would not have been enough to move the average coupon over 10%. Second, the yield to maturity looked high. A quick scan of some Build America Bond CUSIPs indicated that individual bond YTMs were clustered in the high 4s to low 6s, so I didn’t think that a weighted average portfolio of these type of bonds could reach 6.85%. Two phone calls to BlackRock did not help clarify matters, as the phone representatives read from a script along the lines of: Yield to maturity is calculated as the discount rate that sets the present value of the bond’s future cash flows equal to its market price. For bonds that are callable, we used the yield to worst. I have to say, they train them for consistency at BlackRock, as I got the same speech from both representatives. Unfortunately, they were unable to answer questions about how a portfolio YTM could be higher than the component bond YTMs. So I decided to verify this for myself. As the different data sources varied, I figured the only way to convince myself of the YTM and duration was to look at each of the 134 individual holdings listed in their portfolio. I used the latest semiannual report from January 31, 2017, as the main data source. In that report, they helpfully report details about the issuer, coupon rate, maturity, par value, and market value for each of the 134 distinct bond holdings in the BBN portfolio. An example follows below:
 

 Source: Sample information from Blackrock BBN semi-annual report. Armed with this information, one can calculate duration and YTM. The bond’s yield to maturity can be calculated using Excel’s YIELD function, and the duration can be calculated using the MDURATION function. So I entered all 134 holdings into excel and calculated the price, YTM and duration for each of their holdings. The results are pictured below, and I make my excel sheet available on my OneDrive. 

Source: BBN semi-annual report January 31, 2017 and author’s calculations. Using market-value-based weightings (par value and duration weightings are very similar), I get an average coupon of 6.47%, WAL of 24.8 years, average bond price of $118, YTM of 5.19%, and a duration of 12.6 years. These numbers look more in line with the current prices and yields in the Build America Bond market. Analysis of BBN Distributions The current gross income of the BBN portfolio is $110 million a year. This is calculated using the average coupon rate of 6.41% times' par value of $1.726 billion. The net asset value is $1.3 billion ($2 billion in gross market value less $704 million in short-term loans), which means the gross investment income yield is 8.52%. Management fees are $12.6 million (0.91% of NAV), and interest expense is running at about $7 million (0.54% of NAV). This results in net investment income of $91 million a year, or about 7%, which compares very favorably to the 7.06% distribution in their factsheet.
 

 Future Amortization Of Premium Due to the lower interest rate environment compared to 2009-2010, most of the bonds in BBN’s portfolio are selling at a premium. I calculated a weighted average premium of 18%. Assuming that this premium is amortized over the weighted average life of 24.8 years, this is an erosion of 0.72% in the gross bond value every year. Because of the 35% leverage, this translates to a 1.12% a year decline in the NAV as these bonds will trend towards par as they approach maturity. Interest Rate Risks And Impact Of Leverage If the true YTM of the portfolio is 6.85%, then this looks like a low-risk and sustainable distribution. But the portfolio is not really a $1.3 billion portfolio of bonds with a 6.85% YTM. BBN is actually $2 billion of bonds with a 5.2% YTM and a $700 million loan, which is currently costing them 1%. Consider a scenario where long-term rates stay the same (so the value of the municipal bonds doesn’t change) but short-term cost of borrowing increases from 1% to 3%. Now the interest cost goes to $21 million or 1.62% of NAV. Now the distributable net income rate is 5.92%. This drop in income can happen in a situation where there is no change in long-term bond rates, where all the rising rates are on near-term debt (illustration below). 

 Finally, let’s consider a case of a 50bp increase in long-term rates, which leads to a decline in value of the overall bonds of 6.3% (using my calculated 12.6 year duration). In this illustration, there is no change in income, as the short-term rates have been kept constant at 1%, and only long-term rates increased by 0.5% leading to a price impact. This leads to a 6.3% drop in the gross value of the portfolio, which is a 9.7% drop in the NAV.
 

 Call Risk Though I am not an expert on the call characteristics of the individual bonds in BBN’s portfolio, a commenter on my other article pointed out several Build America Bonds that had been called. This is an additional risk to BBN, as premium bonds that are called are only paid their par value. BlackRock reports that 33% of their bonds are callable in the next 5 years, with a total of 40% of the bond portfolio subject to calls anytime in their lifetime. 

 Conclusion Bonds are complicated, and closed-end bond funds such as BBN even more so. Unfortunately, mandatory disclosures by closed-end funds are not particularly effective at communicating the risk characteristics of their portfolio in ways that are easily understood. Closed-end bond funds disclose data on net asset value, NAV discount, and distribution yield in fairly reliable and standardized formats. However, for closed-end funds that specialize in bonds, the disclosure about key variables of yield to maturity, bond premium, and duration has not been effectively standardized in the industry, so it can be more challenging to understand the risk characteristics of the bond fund. In the specific case of BBN, the largest Build America Bond closed-end mutual fund, we can see that the reported Yield to Maturity is much higher than the weighted average yield to maturity of the individual bonds. This is likely to do with how BlackRock deals with leverage, though I must admit that the specifics of their math escapes me.
 In terms of what this means for my investment thesis on BBN, I reiterate the views of my earlier article as follows:  Built-in slow but steady drag on NAV due to amortization of bond price premium, price risk due to long duration and leverage, no buffer from discount to NAV, and  potential distribution cut due to rising short-term borrowing rates (this is a new bonus worry after my deep-dive analysis).  Now, I want to make a point that I think that BlackRock has done a fine job with the construction of BBN's portfolio, paying a manageable distribution from net investment income, and providing pretty good information about the details of their portfolio. I know, because I owned BBN from late 2013 to last week and received lots of high distributions (started at almost 9% if I remember correctly) and a capital gain of 27% as a nice bonus. Where there is room for improvement is for more disclosure on the bond premiums, gross yield to maturity and duration (before leverage), and cost of leverage and hedging practices. This information can provide more insight, especially in markets where interest rate markets are starting to turn.

2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

State of munis if corporate tax rates were cut
06/27/2017

If corporate tax rates were reduced to, say, 25%, do you think the municipal bond market would be OK in terms of demand?



Why did Fed rates rise and muni rates ease?

After the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by .25% last week, why are municipal bond rates off .15% across all maturities and credit ratings?



An opportunity during muni redemptions
06/12/2017

I have a laddered portfolio of California municipal bonds, many of which were purchased in 2007 at or around par. Most have coupon rates of 5.00% and are being redeemed this month. In order to reinvest in similar munis, I had to pay a 16% to 20% premium. In your article, “Summer Forecast: A Muni Redemption Flood, Supply Drought,” you said investors can often enhance their tax-free income when bonds are redeemed. With regard to these 2007 bonds, I don't see how redemptions aren't an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my tax-free income. In the decreasing-rate environment that has been in place for around 30 years, shouldn't investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed?



Why trust the muni bond rating agencies?
05/18/2017

Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s proved their fallibility in 2008 and before.Their ratings are useless.Why should I trust them now?



How can Puerto Rico bonds have AA rating?
05/17/2017

Regarding your article, (Bondholders After Puerto Rico’s Bankruptcy Filing), I noticed you are still selling Puerto Rico bonds with an AA listing.Is there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones I own?How do they get such a great rating?



Determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond
04/28/2017

In your recent article (Muni Investors Succeed by Defying the Odds), you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first, then yield. How should I base my determination of quality? Ratings? If so, which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market?



What to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker
04/28/2017

We have a “prudent-investor” broker with another firm who put over $1 million into Puerto Rico bonds. We almost "killed" him when we found out what he did. Now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return. Any advice? We have about $2 million still invested. We understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in Puerto Rico, which is very slow to react.



Premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal
03/14/2017

I have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium: If I buy, for example, a 10-year face-value muni bond with a 5% coupon for $1,000 par and pay a 10% premium over par, I pay $1,100 to buy the bond. When the bond matures, I get back $1,000 and earn the stated yield-to-maturity when I purchased the bond. Assume that I can roll over a maturing $1,000 bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at $1,100. To obtain the $100 premium, assume I go into my checking account.Isn't the upfront $100 premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment? That is, isn't repayment of the $100 premium simply a return of my investment ($100), not a return on my investment ($100)?



Medicare Part B and tax-exempt income
09/30/2016

I can sign up for Medicare soon and just learned that my rate for Part B could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my tax-exempt interest to my income. This is very unfair. Has your company, and others that sell bonds, been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed?



Too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds
08/18/2016

I live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments. We have a $2 million bond portfolio that she manages. She buys all five-year, high yield (4.00% to 5.00% in today's 1.00% market) munis with stiff premiums. A recent purchase was a $50,000 par value 4.90% California muni with a five-year maturity (we live in CA) for which she paid over $58,000. The whole portfolio is like that. Please explain why she shouldn't buy premium bonds; she won't listen to me. Or call me crazy and tell me it's OK to rack up $80,000 in premiums in this portfolio.
