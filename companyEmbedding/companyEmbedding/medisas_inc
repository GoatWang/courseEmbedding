Meet Medisas, the company that saves people's lives


 Forbes 
                    •
                    April 24, 2014
                
When English-educated doctor and software engineer Gautam Sivakumar founded Medisas, he set out to solve a problem he faced in the workforce. Frustrated by the lack of usable software at his hospital, he built a solution to his biggest pain point: doctor to doctor patient care communication. The result was a cloud-based tool that allowed doctors and nurses to safely transfer patient care between shifts, a process known as the ‘handoff’.

Job Description



A planner by day, a copywriter by night, you take pride in your ability to create something (of measurable value) from nothing through careful research, organized outreach, and meticulous wordsmithing. Whether it’s content marketing or in-person events, your primary responsibility is to drive category development, brand awareness, and revenue growth. You’ll be working closely with sales, design, and our CEO to educate and evangelize our philosophy around hospital collaboration, technology, and how Medisas helps. 
What does success look like? 
+ Multichannel approach to drive awareness of hospital collaboration, technology, and Medisas among C-level executives as well as front-line clinical staff
+ Track and report the success of various traditional, experimental, and account-based marketing efforts
+ Targeted content creation, refinement, and delivery
+ Work closely with sales to achieve target ARR objectives
Why you will succeed:
+ 7-9 years of marketing experience, mainly B2B enterprise marketing to traditional industries (e.g., healthcare, finance, education, government) with longer sales cycles
+ Experience with account-based marketing (ABM)
+ Proven success organizing and executing traditional marketing initiatives (e.g., conference / tradeshow events, speaker / panel opportunities, on-site and in-person events)
+ Comfortable with technology tools and concepts (e.g., executing drip campaigns)
+ Exceptional verbal and visual communication skills

What We're Building




Healthcare is broken and underserved by technology. Hospital software is too complicated, too convoluted, and too disconnected. Doctors spend more time clicking through prompts than checking in on patients, and the quality of care suffers as a result.
Our product helps doctors and nurses easily transfer critical patient information between team members, a process that is responsible for 80% of all serious medical errors and kills over 60,000 patients annually. Today, this information exists on paper or in memory, making it difficult to access and update. We're changing that, and have done so for the care teams of half a million patients.
