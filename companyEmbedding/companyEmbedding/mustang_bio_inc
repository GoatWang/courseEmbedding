MB-101



Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain and central nervous system (CNS) cancer, accounting for 15.1% of all primary brain tumors, and 55.1% of all gliomas. There are an estimated 12,120 new glioblastoma cases predicted in 2016 in the U.S.  Malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and the most common cancer occurring among 15-19 year olds in the U.S.  While GBM is a rare disease (2-3 cases per 100,000 person life years in U.S. and E.U.), it is quite lethal with 5-year survival rates historically less than 10%.   Chemotherapy with temozolomide and radiation are shown to extend mean overall survival from 4.5 to 15 months, while surgery remains the standard of care.  GBM remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.
Immunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments.  IL13Rα2 is an attractive target for CAR T therapy as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is over-expressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBM’s.  CAR T cells are designed to express membrane-tethered IL-13 receptor ligand (IL-13) with high affinity for IL13Rα2 and reduced binding to IL13Rα1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting.
We are developing an optimized CAR T product incorporating enhancements in CAR design and T cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and T cell persistence. We include a second generation hinge optimized CAR containing mutations in the IgG4 linker to reduce off target Fc interactions as well as the 41BB (CD137) co-stimulatory signaling domain for improved survival and maintenance of memory T cells as well as extracellular domain of CD20 as a selection/safety marker. In order to further improve persistence, central memory T cells (TCM) are isolated and enriched. The manufacturing process limits ex vivo expansion in order to reduce T cell exhaustion and maintain a TCM phenotype.
In collaboration with the COH, we have an on-going phase I clinical study to assess the feasibility and safety of using TCM enriched IL13Rα2-specific CAR engineered T cells and are currently treating patients with recurrent/refractory GBM. We will assess the T cell persistence and determine the potential immunogenicity of the cells to determine a recommended phase II dose.

About Us



Overview
Mustang Bio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies based on the ground breaking Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) research of Dr. Stephen Forman and Dr. Christine Brown of City of Hope, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Mustang was formed to help bring this pioneering CAR research to as many patients as possible. Mustang, through a research agreement with COH, will develop CARs across multiple cancers, including for AML and Brain Cancer. Both of the lead programs are in phase I clinical trials.
Mustang believes that harnessing the body’s own immune system to treat cancer is the next generation of cancer care that may prove curative across tumor types that have proved resilient to standard pharmacological and biological treatments.  CAR-T uses the patient’s own T-cells to engage and destroy specific tumors.  The process involves selecting specific T-cell subtypes, genetically engineering them to express chimeric antigen T-cell receptors and placing them back in the patient where they recognize and destroy cancer cells.
Mustang’s exclusive license and sponsored research agreement at the COH encompasses specific chimeric T-cell constructions and enabling process technologies including linker technology improvements.   This agreement covers the discovery, manufacturing and clinical development of novel Chimeric Antigen Receptor engineered T-cells (CAR-T) along with specified rights to any and all inventions.
Two of the CAR-T’s from our collaboration with the COH are already in phase I clinical development.  The first is a proprietary engineered Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells targeting interleukin 13 Receptor α2 which is overexpressed on the surface of glioblastoma (GBM) cells.
The second is a proprietary CAR-T targeting of CD123, which is overexpressed on the surface of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cells.
Mustang also has a sponsored preclinical research agreement in place with COH to develop additional CAR-T cell products.

 MUSTANG BIO, INC. (NASDAQ:FBIO) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.01.




Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.




The information set forth under Item 3.02 of this Current Report
on Form 8-K regarding the Transaction Documents (as such term is
defined in Item 3.02 below) is incorporated herein by reference.




Item 3.02.


Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.




On November 30, 2016, Mustang Bio, Inc. (the Company) completed a
third closing of the private placement (the Transaction)
previously reported by the Company in its Current Report on Form
8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October
6, 2016 (the Prior 8-K), which is incorporated by reference
herein. In this third closing, the Company sold 190.02 Units to
certain accredited investors (the Units) to a Unit Purchase
Agreement (each a Purchase Agreement). As described in the Prior
8-K, each Unit consists of 10,000 shares of the Companys common
stock, $0.001 par value per share (the Common Stock) and warrants
(the Warrants) exercisable immediately for 2,500 shares of Common
Stock for five years at an exercise price of $8.50 per share, for
a purchase price of $65,000 per Unit. The Units sold in the third
closing are comprised of 1,900,215 shares of Common Stock and
Warrants to purchase 475,053 shares of Common Stock for aggregate
gross proceeds of $12,351,397.50.


In connection with the third closing, the Companys placement
agent, to the Placement Agent Agreement dated August 3, 2016 (the
Placement Agent Agreement), received a cash fee of $1,235,139.75
and a warrant to purchase 190,021 shares of Common Stock (the
Placement Agent Warrant).


Also, on December 6, 2016, the Company and the Placement Agent
entered into an Amendment to the Placement Agent Agreement (the
Amendment to the Placement Agent Agreement) in order to extend
the period for subsequent closings of the Transaction to January
31, 2017 and, in connection therewith, revised the form of
Purchase Agreement to reflect such extension (Amended Purchase
Agreement and, collectively with the Purchase Agreement,
Warrants, Placement Agent Warrant, Placement Agent Agreement, and
Amendment to the Placement Agent Agreement, the Transaction
Documents). The Amendment to the Placement Agent Agreement did
not change any other material terms of the Placement Agent
Agreement and no other terms of the Purchase Agreement, except
the termination date, were changed in the Amended Purchase
Agreement.


The Units, Warrants and Placement Agent Warrant were offered and
sold in a private placement to exemptions from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
Securities Act), afforded by Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506 of
Regulation D promulgated thereunder. To the extent that any
shares of Common Stock are issued in connection with the
Transaction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States
absent registration or the availability of an applicable
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act.



The foregoing descriptions of the Transaction Documents are
subject to the full and complete terms of each such Transaction
Document and the form of Purchase Agreement, form of Warrant, the
Placement Agent Warrant and the Placement Agent Agreement which
were filed with the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 2016,
and the Amendment to the Placement Agent Agreement and form of
Amended Purchase Agreement which will be filed with the Companys
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.


The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K is
not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any
securities of the Company.
