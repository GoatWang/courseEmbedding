 Educational Background



 


University of California -  Los Angeles

                  UCLA's primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society. To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from intolerance. In all of our pursuits, we strive at once for excellence and diversity, recognizing that openness and inclusion produce true quality. These values underlie our three institutional responsibilities.

Learning and teaching at UCLA are guided by the belief that undergraduate, graduate and professional school students and their teachers belong to a community of scholars. This community is dedicated to providing students with a foundational understanding of a broad range of disciplines followed by the opportunity for in-depth study in a chosen discipline. All members of the community are engaged together in discovering and advancing knowledge and practice. Learning occurs not only in the classroom but also through engagement in campus life and in communities and organizations beyond the university.

The UCLA Foundation

                    Through The UCLA Foundation, generous donors participate with building, sustaining and advancing the University.

While there was a time when state funds covered almost every dollar UCLA needed to operate, today only 7 percent of the University’s total budget is paid for through the state’s general fund. Private philanthropy provides the resources UCLA requires to continue growing its stature as a global leader in the creation, sharing and application of knowledge.

Specifically, The UCLA Foundation:

    Receives contributions made by alumni, friends, private foundations and corporations on behalf of UCLA’s many schools, units and departments
    Disburses the contributions according to the expressed wishes of the donor
    Invests and manages the contributions to protect and enhance their value
    Actively promotes philanthropy across the campus
