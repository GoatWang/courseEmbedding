Habitat for Humanity Project
One of the greatest
opportunities and challenges in professional forestry lies in communicating positively
with the public. We have much that is positive to communicate! We are proud of
Michigans vast healthy forests....the largest dedicated state forest system in the
country, three national forests, and over 10 million acres in private and corporate
forests. We are proud as well of our role as forest stewards helping to manage this
resource for a myriad of uses and resource outputs.
The Michigan Society of American Foresters (MISAF), in preparing to host
the 1998 National SAF Convention, has formed a partnership with the Traverse City Habitat
for Humanity program to build a home. We feel this offers foresters and forest industry
alike a tremendous opportunity to showcase our forest resources with a very direct and
specific outcome...a home for a family. Under the guidance of certified builders, we will
physically build the home at the convention site during the convention. Hundreds of SAF
volunteers will be involved in this week-long house raising effort.
Our outreach project does not stop there. We will use video, photo and
live interviews to graphically illustrate the connection between the wood products in the
home and the resource where they are managed. Building materials will be linked to the
private, industrial, state and federal lands where they originated. Each site will be used
to illustrate stewardship and land management for resource outputs.
A documentary is planned in partnership with a local television station.
The story of our home will be used to feature how Michigan forestry provides a healthy and
productive forest resource. The focus will be on the people who plant the trees, manage or
own the land, harvest a renewable resource, produce forest products, and finally, utilize
the forest products. Most importantly, this home building effort will demonstrate how
families rely on the many wood products used in everyday living. The documentary will also
focus on the environmental advantages of wood over other products, its low energy cost to
produce, its renewability, and its abundance. Lastly, it will highlight the most recent
Michigan resource facts such as Michigans timber volume has increased more than a
third since 1980. 
We want this to be a media EVENT! We hope to draw national attention as
well as day to day local media coverage. The public will watch as the "drama"
unfolds from a managed forest to a pile of wood at the start of the convention to a home
for a family at convention close. It will be a vivid representation tying the natural
resource to the homes people build.
This is your invitation to participate. The success of this outreach
depends on support from MISAF members and the forestry community. We have an excellent
opportunity to accomplish something that we have been talking about doing for quite some
time - communicate to the public about forestry and about SAF. A core group of about a
dozen MISAF members led by Bill Sterrett
(616-824-9080; sterretw@state.mi.us)
is seeking financial and material support; working with the National SAF; contracting
professional video services; and seeking a significant national spokesperson to champion
our efforts. We expect involvement from many as this project evolves. Convention attendees
will have the opportunity to pound a few nails too! Were excited about the project
and its tremendously positive attributes. This will be the largest gathering of
professional foresters in the world for 1998. Please join us!

Forestry Assistance for
Non-Industrial Private Landowners

Editors note: This is a position paper 
    submitted by the CDFC which represents 
    Conservation District Foresters across the state.


The significance of non-industrial private forestlands here in Michigan
is well documented. It has been reported that forestland acreages have increased 6 percent
since 1980. It is also significant that individual ownership of private forestland is
increasing. That is, there are more people who own forested acres than ever before. Of the
18.5 million acres of forestland in the state, non-industrial private forest (NIPF)
landowners hold approximately 55 percent of this land2. In addition,
Michigans forest economy continues to grow, increasing the demand for wood products
from NIPF landowners.
Private land management objectives are diverse and constantly changing.
More often than not, private ownership goals revolve around other forest benefits such as
wildlife, aesthetics, and recreational uses. Producing forest products is rarely the
reason for ownership of NIPF lands. Landowners often have difficulty balancing
multiple-use issues on their acreages and often succumb to poor management advice. The
lack of sound advice causes many landowners to withdraw their acreages from any management
recommendations or activities.
The delivery of sound, unbiased technical assistance is the cornerstone
of the educational process. Assisting landowners in resource planning as well as the
implementation of planned practices is a huge responsibility. Mistakes in land management
activities are often long term and have far reaching consequences. 
The offering of unbiased technical assistance in forestry has been well
received throughout the state. Requests for assistance cover the full gamut of
forestry-related subjects. Areas of assistance considered extremely significant or
important are as follows:

On-the-ground technical assistance to landowners
Long range resource planning
Proper harvesting and marketing referral advice
Information and educational programs
Wildlife habitat 
Reforestation 
Watershed protection 
Incentives programs; applications and implementation
Insect and disease problems
Rural development
Resource protection

The Conservation District foresters play a key role in providing
unbiased services to NIPF landowners and the protection of Michigans natural
resources. CD foresters have a unique perspective regarding private forestland activities
and have the ability to strengthen and cultivate common interests regarding forestry
issues statewide.

MISAF SPRING MEETING
by Deb Begalle and Ken Salo
A joint meeting hosted by Michigan SAF and the Michigan Chapter of the
Wildlife Society was held February 19-20,1998 at Escanaba, Michigan. This was an
appropriate site for the field workshop entitled "Lowland Conifers: Cooperative
Management of a Complex Resource", since 75% of Michigan's lowland conifers occur in
the Upper Peninsula with Delta County having the second highest lowland acreage.
Additionally, Delta County is a major deer wintering area. About 150 attendees rotated by
busloads through established demonstration stops for on-site discussions of the problems
and opportunities presented by this particular mix of forestry and wildlife management.
Thursday morning speakers provided background for afternoon and Friday
field trips. Gem Castillo, Michigan State University (MSU), displayed the composition and
distribution of three lowland conifer stands (tamarack, cedar, and black spruce) with
associated species components. He presented average stumpage prices for these species from
the 1950's to mid-1990's. There is a trend of increased prices - especially in the sawlog
category. A visit to the Rapid River Rustic Log Home manufacturer late in the day
demonstrated there is a demand for cedar posts and logs which are in short supply, thus
increasing the stumpage price of cedar.
Kurt Pregitzer, Michigan Technological University (MTU), summarized the
history and ecology of cedar. Compared to pre-European times, the occurrence of fir and
cedar has increased; whereas, tamarack has declined dramatically and spruce slightly.
Today's cedar forests are the result of logging and related disturbance in the late
1800's. Some stands re-established full stocking within 20 years of harvest while other
stands continued to gain stocking through the 1950's. Kurt stressed that, in cedar, there
may be no relationship between size and age. This was later demonstrated in the field,
where two trees of vastly different diameters that were cut were shown to be of the same
age.
Jim Hammill, Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), rounded
out the morning with remarks on use of lowland conifers by wildlife and the transition
zones between lowlands and uplands. 
In the field, Kevin Doran, U.S. Forest Service, pointed out how the
closed canopy in these stands reduces snow depth and produces a microclimate conducive to
wintering deer. Other field stops the first day included demonstrations of solar electric
and conventional fencing to exclude deer and protect cedar regeneration, lime and
fertilizer application, site preparation with heavy machinery, and cut and leave strips.
Overall, the day showed the importance and difficulty of managing lowland conifers, and
the extreme difficulty of obtaining successful cedar regeneration in areas of high deer
population. It is clear that lowland conifer management has to be a joint effort between
wildlife and forestry professionals. 
Two thoughts seemed to recur throughout day. If you believe high deer
populations are inhibiting establishment of forest regeneration, you need to express that
opinion at public meetings and elsewhere when MDNR biologists must face hunters who want
higher populations of deer. Foresters must make clear to the public the short and
long-term impacts of high deer populations on the forests, not only in winter deer yards
but in other forest types as well. A second thought was that winter feeding of the deer
only compounds the problems of high deer numbers and should be discouraged.
Friday field trips discussed actual management applications on public
and private lands. At a small clear-cut within the North Perkins Deer Yard on the Escanaba
River State Forest, speakers Craig Albright, Biologist/MDNR, Dean Wilson, Forester/MDNR,
and Mike Zuidema, retired silviculturist/MDNR, discussed problems and rationale for the
area. State policy is to cut about 40 acres per year in the cedar type for research. In
view of the long establishment period for cedar, it's slow growth, longevity, and risk of
converting to other species, this is felt to be a very conservative approach which does
not jeopardize existing cedar stands. A major drawback to thinning cedar stands by
removing short-lived species is the opening of these otherwise impenetrable stands to ATV
traffic and a host of negative issues associated with this access. Economic implications
of the state (and federal) cut-no-cedar policy are a decrease of supply, increase of
prices, and the shift of the market (and decision-making) to private landowners.
A site visit to a privately owned area for the day was a 320 acre swamp
conifer tract owned by Don Bovin, primarily managed as recreational lands. Mr. Bovin is
working with Mead Corporation forester Vic Lyberg. A 40 acre harvest is planned which
includes clearcutting areas of balm-of-gilead, and thinning cedar by cutting trees
containing at least two merchantable pieces. The objective of the harvest is to recapture
some of the investment in purchase cost of the land and taxes, while leaving most of the
acreage alone. The expected per acre return is fairly high and demonstrates why private
landowners may be more willing to permit harvest on their properties.
Attendees to this excellent field workshop left with a bibliography and
technical binder compiled by Ray Miller, Brad Bender, and Bill Cook, 5 CFE credits to
claim, and hopefully a greater appreciation of the complexities (both for biologists and
foresters) of managing lowland conifer stands in deer country.

Greatest Convention Ever!!!
By Mike Moore, General Chairman
All members of the Michigan State Society of American Foresters should
feel great pride in the substantial work carried out by their peers in preparing for the
worlds largest gathering of Foresters during 1998. As General Chair, I have been
amazed at the members from all walks of life and employment working side-by-side to
showcase the great state of Michigan. Great Lakes, Great Forests, Great Times, Great
State!
As we head for September I want to take this opportunity to thank all of
the many Committee chairs and co-chairs. The complete list is shown elsewhere in this
edition. Without exception people have gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure
that their professional society has a first rate convention!
First and foremost, I want to specifically cite Laurie Marzolo for her
leadership, creativity, and organizational skills. Along with her equally efficient
Arrangement Team co-chair, Jim Bernier, she has kept the day-to-day operations of
Convention planning running smoothly. Michigans preparation has drawn much praise
from the National Office and a good deal of this is due to Lauries hard work. Let me
say to all Michigan Society members...Laurie is the straw that stirs the drink! The
Arrangements Committee is made up of over 50 members and each has not only contributed,
they have excelled! Exhibits, public relations, entertainment, tours, facilities, room
arrangements, leisure activities, and all the rest have made me so very proud to be a
forester.
The Program Committee has also been of top-notch quality and results.
Chair Karen Potter-Witter and Co-chair Bill Rockwell have put together a first rate
program with the help of the other members from around the United States. Of particular
note are the three plenary sessions where absolute top speakers are on the agenda. Our
keynoter, William Rustem, is the Senior Vice President for Public Sector Consultants. Bill
is very interested in land use. We are very pleased with Bills participation.
Working with Karen is a pleasure, she always follows up on issues, meets deadlines and
works in a most professional manner. The National Office has also cited our Program
Committee for its outstanding and timely work!
I would be negligent if I did not mention the assistance of Diana Perl,
Manager of Conventions, National Office. She is another highly professional person. She is
ably assisted by Mike Murphy. We have an excellent relationship with our National Office
due to Dianas ability, high good humor, and management ability.
You should have received Registration materials in the mail in early
May. All that remains is for you to sign up and come to Traverse City in September!!

Showing Off Our Great Lakes
and Great Forests
by Loren B. Ford / Working Group Tour Chair
If you want to exercise bragging rights to other foresters from across
North America by showing them the forest management leadership we're proud of as Michigan
SAF members, then you'd better register early for the 1998 National Convention at Grand
Traverse Resort! Your best opportunity will be on Technical Tour Day, Tuesday, September
22. While we won't come close to showing all aspects of what makes Michigan the land of
"Great Lakes and Great Forests", some really dedicated volunteers have put
together 14 tours that will make a heck of an attempt.
The tours are
sponsored by 22 of SAF's 29 Working Groups, except for the Student Tour, which will be
hosted by Michigan State and Michigan Tech Student Chapters. With field sites almost as
varied as SAF's Working Groups, the technical tours will feature forest fragmentation,
remote sensing, Kirtland's warbler management, the Au Sable fishery, riparian buffers,
upland and wetland ecosystems of the eastern UP, non-industrial private forest management,
fire, wilderness and recreation management, products and utilization, and a visit to our
past at the CCC Museum, Hartwick Pines State Park, and the 1888 Beal Plantation. Isn't it
great working for such a broad-ranging profession? This is the opportunity to hear from
the experts about a discipline that you might not get a chance to work with on your job. 
There's no need to be a Working Group member to go on a tour. However,
there's only limited space available, and registration will be on a first-come,
first-served basis. There might still be a need for volunteers for a few specific tours to
help the volunteer guides with lunches, hand-outs, etc. Otherwise, you'll have to sign up
and pay for your tour like members from other state societies. Tours require an extra
charge beyond the convention registration fee, calculated to cover the cost of the tour.
Remember, register early. Check the convention brochure for more details, or contact me at
(517) 826-3252, or lford/r9_huronmanistee@fs.fed.us.
 
Great Expectations
by Robert DeVillez / Entertainment
Great Lakes/Great
Forests and "Great Times" at the Grand Traverse Resort in 98. Entertainment will
abound at this year's SAF National Convention. There's music in the air and your feet will
want to dance. From exhibit hall opening activities on Saturday to the Northwoods Hooetnanny on Tuesday night,
foresters and their families will delight in a variety of entertainment activities. 
The diversions at this year's convention will offer a perfect blend.
It's a resort destination that packages sports and entertainment in a relaxing atmosphere.
Professional music performances, memorable art, and sports opportunities await you.
Song of the Lakes, a musical
quartet that sings the praises of the Land and of the Lakes, will appear at the Monday
night social and banquet. They will enchant both young and old with their unique, high
energy, "new folk" sound that has captured fans from all walks of life.
A second concert will be presented on Sunday night that will surely
delight those of us who have music in our hearts. The Interlochen Center for the Arts and
the ChoralAires of the
Traverse City High School will perform an outstanding collection of music and dance.
These are just a few of the performers and artists scheduled at this
year's convention. The Entertainment Committee invites you to bring your family and enjoy
the fun!
 
Come Home To Michigan
by Mike Moore
What a great convention your professional peers have planned for
September! It is my estimation that the State of Michigan institutions of higher learning
have produced more foresters than any other state. Michigan State University, University
of Michigan, and Michigan Technological University have all graduated foresters for many
years with the two downstate universities dating back to the turn of the century.
Therefore, we have embarked on a campaign - "Come Home To
Michigan" - to bring back the graduates. We have sent individual letters to each of
the three Department Heads asking them to emphasize the Convention in their mailings to
Alumni.
We need your help also. How about inviting your summer camp roommates
back? Do you have friends that you would like to reconnect with? What an opportunity!
College days always bring back a stream of memories. Make that call to your fellow crew
member in dendrology, soils, or management class.
We plan to have the Alumni Socials for the three schools in adjoining
rooms on Sunday evening. Maybe we can replay the Paul Bunyan Liars Contest or other
Conclave activities...
 
Visit with Your
Friends 
by Joyce Angel-Ling
Plan to make the most of your trip to Traverse City! Plan a few days in
advance to allow yourself some time to make stops along the way to visit folks you
havent seen in a while. Or make the most of the fall colors on your return trip
home, and meander along the back roads to your friends place so you can catch up on
old times! Maybe you and your friends can take the time to throw a line in the stream to
catch a fish or two, or get some bird hunting in. You can also take the opportunity to do
some camping as you travel to and from Traverse City, as well as camping on the Bay at Traverse City State Park while attending the
Convention. Take the time to look through the Convention brochure and perhaps one of the
tours would be a relaxing way to catch up with a buddy while enjoying the local sights!
Another option would be to invite your friends to the convention itself.
Lets demonstrate how the forestry profession is managing their resources. As you
look through the Convention brochure, its plain to see how our rich state and its
surrounding neighbors are being showcased to the Nation along with the most current issues
facing resource managers. The discussions promise to be very challenging for any
stakeholder. So maybe there is someone you know who would want to attend this convention,
for even a day or two, just pass along the brochure. The possibilities of Great Times with
Great Friends are endless, so just get your Michigan map out and start making plans!

Exhibitors Galore!
by Bernie Carr
The exhibitor Prospectus has been sent out to potential exhibitors. The
exhibitor sub-team made a major effort to include all potential exhibitors on the SAF
mailing list in Michigan and the surrounding area. However, as with all undertakings of
this magnitude, some potential exhibitors may have been missed. If you know of anyone who
was inadvertently left off the exhibitor mailing list, please contact Roger Misiak (517)
354-2121, Susan Thiel (517)348-6371 or Bernie Carr (906) 487-2667. If you wish to
personally provide someone with a copy of the prospectus - Roger, Susan, or Bernie have
extra copies available. Copies of the prospectus can also be obtained from Jack Pilon or
Laurie Marzolo at the MDNR office in Roscommon, MI. Please check around your area to make
sure potential exhibitors have received an invitation to exhibit their product at our
national convention in Traverse City.
When you attend the convention, plan to visit the exhibit area and learn
about new products which may be useful to your career and business. While the exhibit area
will provide you with a wonderful source of new tools and information associated with the
forestry profession, it will also help the MISAF present you with a financially sound and
exiciting convention.
 
Sister Societies
MISAF Teams Up
by Mike Lanasa
Something new in 1998 is the establishment of a Sister Society
relationship between Michigan SAF and Mississippi SAF. You have probably heard of sister
cities before. Generally a city in the United States will pair up with a city in another
part of the word to gain understanding and promote friendship between the two cities.
Hopefully we can achieve similar results between SAF members in Michigan and Mississippi.
It promises to be an interesting approach to learning about forestry in another part of
the country. The two states are similar in that both have about 600 SAF members and
somewhere between 17-18 million acres of forest. On the other hand, Michigan has about 35%
public ownership of forests while 89% of Mississippi forest is in private ownership. And
while both states have a similar volume of growing stock, Mississippis growth is 50%
higher and removals are double those in Michigan. How do these differences affect the way
foresters view resource management? 
The Sister Society concept originated at the SAF National Leadership
Academy in 1997. Bob Daniels, Mississippi Chair and Mike Lanasa, Michigan Chair, wanted to
initiate a way to help foresters from their respective states get to know one another and
to learn how forestry in each state is practiced. A follow-up meeting between officers of
the two societies at the Memphis Convention quickly indicated the possibilities for
increased understanding of forestry issues and approaches to dealing with them. A lively
discussion of BMPs, forester registration and prescribed burning laws showed different
ways of approaching common situations. It was very evident to those present that the
Sister Society concept has much to offer members in both states.
In 1998, we will begin to explore this relationship and see where it
goes. We have begun by exchanging newsletters between officers in each of the states. The
Michigan Forester is being sent to Mississippi and we in Michigan are receiving The
Magnolia Forester. We will also be initiating a section in the Michigan Forester with
information provided from Mississippi SAF and vice versa. The idea being to start
communication between foresters in the two states. It has also been suggested that we plan
a social event at the National Convention for members from the two states. Other
activities may occur in the future as this concept develops. The Sister Society
relationship between Michigan and Mississippi SAF is a first for the Society of American
Foresters. It has great promise to foster and promote friendships and professional
exchange. If you have ideas on activities we should try or methods to improve the concept
please let your Executive Team know. 
 
Mississippi Forest
Industry Maturing
Reprinted from The Clarion-Ledger, October 20, 1997
Mississippis forest products have set record production values in
nine of the past 10 years, but the best word to describe the industry is
"maturing". "Mississippis forest industry is beginning to mature and
has established a firm hold on the national market," said Bob Daniels, extension
forestry specialist at Mississippi State University.
The South has net an incresed share of the nations softwood lumber
needs in the past five years, and this has benefitted Mississippis economy.
"Today our industry is more of a critical piece of the national puzzle than
ever," Daniels said. "It is even more important now for landowners to keep land
in forests, make good management decisions and boost timber production." 
About 70 percent of Mississippis forest production value is from
pine, including pulp and paper, poles, lumber and strucural panel products like plywood.
Daniels said the delivered value of pine sawlogs was almost half a
billion dollars in 1996. Pine sawlogs were 41 percent of the toal havest value.
"Trends toward more outdoor activities and the use of treated wood in construciton
have contributed to the value of pine," Daniels said. 
The bulk of the hardwood industry is lumber production, primarily red
and white oak lumber. The 1996 value of hardwood sawlogs was $ 130 million. The value of
hardwood pulpwood (pulp and paper) for 1996 was $ 139 million.
"This wood goes into chips for pulp and paper or structural panels
like oriented strandboard," Daniels said. "Mississippi exports about 10 percent
of the hardwood chips". 

Obituary: Lynn Sandberg
Lynn Sandberg, a 50-year member of SAF, died on November 19, 1997 in
L'Anse, Michigan, after a short illness.
Lynn earned his BS in Forestry from the University of Minnesota in 1947,
and became an SAF member in the same year. Prior to earning his degree, Lynn owned and
managed Sandberg Dray Line, a company which trucked mainly forest products. Following
graduation from college, Lynn joined the State of Minnesota as a Supervisor of Forestry in
the office of Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation. In 1950, he joined Lake Superior
Timber Company where he served as manager of the land acquisition company. From 1952 until
1957, Lynn was the owner and manager of his own forest products company. In 1957, he
accepted a position with Celotex Corporation in L'Anse, as manager of their 242,000 acres
of forest land. In 1969, Lynn moved to Escanaba as General Manager of Woodlands for the
Escanaba Paper Company and Mead Corporation where he oversaw management of 460,000 acres
of forest land. He retired from the Mead Corporation in 1980, and returned to the L'Anse
area where he remained active as a consultant and tree farmer.
Over the years, Lynn Sandberg was active in many forestry-related
organizations. He served as Chair of the Wisconsin-Michigan Society and was elected an SAF
Fellow. He was a member of the Michigan Forest Association and the Forest Products
Research Society. A Registered Forester, Lynn served on the State of Michigan Board of
Registration of Foresters. He also found time to serve as a Director for two different
banks, and as a member of the Michigan State Wilderness and Natural Areas Board; the Upper
Peninsula Committee for Area Progress; and the Michigan Wood Resource Development Task
Force.

Family: Married to Marge for 58 years as of next September; three
children including Barb, trained as a forester and engineer and currently a Mead mill
manager.
Career: Served with Army ROTC in South Dakota; CCC camp officer
in Illinois; active duty in the Army and Air Force for about five years in various
locations; also worked for a lumber company in Detroit when a lot of building was going
on. Moved at least 13 times within the first six years.
In November, 1945, Rueben started with Kimberly-Clark in the Duluth area
and worked most of the time out of Marquette and Iron Mountain until May, 1974 when he
retired just shy of 30 years. He recalls very interesting and fun times primarily in the
field, and lots of independence while looking over the wood supply for Kimberly-Clark's
two Wisconsin mills.
Highlights of his career included testing two large electric chainsaws
that never worked out in the Duluth area; getting approval to build the current Champion
field office west of Champion along Highway 28/41 which was prompted by a visit from a new
KC vice president who saw the poor conditions of his "old shack" of an office;
working on getting the early version of double bottom loader trucks on the road due to
poor rail service; and spearheading industry's movement to more mechanized logging systems
(feller-buncher prototypes) in the early 1970's.
SAF Involvement: (1948-1998) Rueben mentioned that the chapter
was not too active in the 1950's and 1960's. He did serve on a committee in conjunction
with MTU to get foresters registered in the state. (Sound familiar? Maybe Jim Meteer can
shed more light on this effort.)
Other Organizations: In the National Guard for 12 years; joined
the Golden Kiwanis after retirement and headed up the Iron Mountain and Escanaba clubs;
and served as an Elder in the Presbyterian Church for over 25 years.
Hobbies: Builds and flies radio-controlled model airplanes.
 
Researchers Analyze
Public Response to National Forest Issues
Reprinted from Logging News, Iron Mountain, MI
April 30, 1997
Houghton - How do you feel about your local national forest? How would
you like to see it managed? These are questions that few of us give much thought to, but
the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service is interested in trying to find the best
way to gather it.
Kathy Halverson, an assistant professor of natural resource policy at
Michigan Tecnological University, and Deborah Carr, a research social scientist with the
Forest Service, are analyzing current methods for gathering community response. "It
is hard to reach people effectively," Halvorsen said, so she and Carr are developing
and testing mechanisms for involving the community. Houghton, Hancock, St. Ignace,
Munising, Ironwood and the west Iron County area are involved in the evaluations.
In addition to learning about how to best gather information, Carr and
Halvorsen will be collecting a great deal of data during the testing, as well as learning
the dynamics of the communities. The Forest Service is interested in public opinion on
such issues as wildlife diversity and management, as well as recreation, or the amount of
time, trails and resources that are made available to the public.
Although not required to gather community input annually, Phyllis Green,
The Forest Supervisor of the Ottawa National Forest, said her agency is always interested
in peoples attitudes and concerns regarding public land management.
The Forest Service is required to involve the public every 10 to 15
years when developing their forest plan, but Green said, "We cant wait that
long between talking to people. If you want to know what your neighbors are thinking,
its best to ask them."
She said the standard methods for contacting the public involve direct
mailings, open houses, and public meetings. The public hearing model is frequently used
according to Halvorsen. 
But she said public land managers find that each method has its
strengths and weaknesses. "We are interested in figuring out what works best."
There are two other methods that are being evaluated and compared to public hearings. The
first is "focused conversations with community groups". Halvorsen and a Forest
Service employee attend meetings with groups that range from the Rotary Club and church
groups to sportsmens clubs and environmental groups. 
Halvorsen starts the conversations with general questions, aksing about
the group members feelings toward their community, later focusing the meeting to an
open discussion about forest management with the Forest Service employee.
The second method was developed as a way to make metings fun and
convenient. It is called the "family and community town supper" and it was
developed by the Wisconsin Clearinghouse for Prevention Resources in Madison. 
Community members are invited to bring their families to the supper, and
while they eat they sit around and talk about forest management. Forest Service employees
are also in attendance, observing and participating in the conversations.
In addition to the meetings, Carr is distributing a survey to seasonal
and permanent residents of the test communities. The survey is being used to gather the
same information as the meetings, and it may also be used to compare the opinions of
sesonal and permanent residents. "Although surveys are commonly used, it is rare to
try different approaches to ask the same group of people the same questions, " Carr
said. "Were hoping to be able to compare the nature of information gathered in
surveys versus face to face conversations."
Depending on the type of issue, one method may be more appropriate, or
one method may receive a better response.
The ultimate question for Halvorsen and Carr to answer is: What do
people like - how are they most comfortable discussing issues that affect the national
forests and public land?
The project is being funded by the Forest Service, as well as through
multiple funding sources from Michigan Tech.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Bergen County, New Jersey, a suburb of greater New York City,[5] and raised in Oradell, New Jersey, the only girl among three brothers,[6] Rothschild is the daughter of Annabelle (née Hewitt)[7] and John Kenneth Forester, president and owner of the General Aviation Aircraft Services, now Meridian, in Teterboro, New Jersey. She studied at Pomona College and Columbia Law School, where she volunteered for the United States Senate campaign of Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[5]
She also studied international law at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.[8]
Career[edit]
After leaving law school, she was an associate at the Simpson Thacher & Bartlett law firm for four years, before working for telecommunications billionaire John Kluge in the 1980s,[5] helping him acquire small companies that held local cellular licenses.[6]
Rothschild then invested in telecoms businesses in North America and Europe, in partnership with Motorola,[6] claiming in 2012 that by the late 1990s she was making a nine-figure salary.[9]
Rothschild became Executive Vice President for Development at Metromedia Inc from 1984–1989.[citation needed] From 1989–1995, Rothschild was the majority shareholder, Chairman and CEO, of TPI Communications International, Inc., one of the largest providers of paging, wireless data and cellular telephone service in Latin America, owned with Motorola.[citation needed]
Under her management, TPI tripled its size and per-customer revenues, and cash flow grew to three times the U.S. average.[citation needed] In addition, she expanded operations from Puerto Rico into Latin America. She sold her stake in TPI to Motorola in 1995 for a figure reportedly between $80 million and $100 million.[6]
In 1995, Rothschild founded FirstMark Communications Inc in the United States, a broadband wireless company. In 1997, she sold her US interests in order to focus on international opportunities. In 1998, she founded FirstMark Communications of Europe, with the mission of building a pan-European broadband Internet company. Having secured licenses in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Finland, she built a 20,000 klm fiber network in 15 countries. The company was sold in June 2000 in a $1 billion financing, the largest private equity placement in the history of the European competitive telecommunications sector.[citation needed]
Rothschild currently serves on the Board of Directors of Estée Lauder Companies, The Economist Group,[5] Bronfman E.L. Rothschild LP and Christies International. She has also served on the Boards of Directors of Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and General Instruments, Inc.[citation needed]
Politics[edit]
From 1993–1995, Rothschild served on President Bill Clinton's National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council. From 1998–2000, she served on the US Secretary of Energy's Advisory Committee.[8]
Rothschild has donated to all of Bill and Hillary Clinton's federal races since 1992.[10] Although Rothschild was a major fund raiser for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, she transferred her support to Republican candidate John McCain when Barack Obama beat Clinton, becoming a minor celebrity on cable television at the time for attacking Obama in a series of interviews.[5]
On June 22, 2011, she hosted a fundraiser for Jon Huntsman Jr.'s presidential campaign, an event originally planned to support Mitt Romney before she had a change of heart in the early summer of 2011.[11] In the summer of 2016, she hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.[12]
Rothschild co-chaired/founded the day-long Conference of Inclusive Capitalism in London on May 27, 2014,[13] with the aim of adjusting the working of the capitalist system to work for more people and included an opening address by Prince Charles and guest speaker Bill Clinton.[14] The second conference also took place in London on June 26, 2015
Rothschild is actively involved in policy and social issues, including micro-finance and women's rights. In 2006, she was appointed as a member of the UN Advisors Group on Inclusive Financial Services.[citation needed] She serves as Chairman of the Board for the American Patrons of the Tate Gallery, FAI, and the International Advisory Board of Columbia University School of Law.[8] In addition, she serves as a Trustee of the ERANDA Foundation (a Rothschild family foundation), the Outward Bound Trust, the Alfred Herrhausen Society of International Dialogue of Deutsche Bank and the Global Commercial Microfinance Consortium Advisory Board of Deutsche Bank.[8] She also sits on the board of the McCain Institute.[15]
She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (USA), Chatham House (UK), the Institute for Strategic Studies (UK), the International Advisory Council of Asia House (UK), and the Foreign Policy Association (USA).[8]
Personal life[edit]
Rothschild has been married three times. Her first marriage was to Alexander Hartley Platt, a doctor's son from New Jersey, took place at Brick Presbyterian Church on May 20, 1978.[16]
Her second husband was Andrew Stein (born March 4, 1945), a New York politician and son of multi-millionaire businessman Jerry Finkelstein.[17] Stein is nine years older than Forester and was Manhattan Borough President at the time of their marriage on March 12, 1983[18] and together, had two children before their divorce a decade later in 1993.[19]

Benjamin Forester Stein (b. 1985),[20] a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania (2008)[21]
John ("Jake") Forester Stein (b. 1988),[20] a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania (2010)[21]

Her third husband is Sir Evelyn de Rothschild (born August 29, 1931), whom she was introduced to by Henry Kissinger at the 1998 Bilderberg Group conference in Scotland.[22] They married on November 30, 2000 in London, England,[1] after de Rothschild divorced his wife in 2000.[23] She is his third wife.[1] On the announcement of the marriage, the Rothschild couple were invited to spend their honeymoon at the White House by the Clintons.[24] The couple divide their time between homes in New York and London, the summer home on Martha’s Vineyard and the Rothschild family's historic country estate in England. By virtue of her marriage to a knight, she is known socially as Lady de Rothschild.[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Bergen County, New Jersey, a suburb of greater New York City,[5] and raised in Oradell, New Jersey, the only girl among three brothers,[6] Rothschild is the daughter of Annabelle (née Hewitt)[7] and John Kenneth Forester, president and owner of the General Aviation Aircraft Services, now Meridian, in Teterboro, New Jersey. She studied at Pomona College and Columbia Law School, where she volunteered for the United States Senate campaign of Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[5]
She also studied international law at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.[8]
Career[edit]
After leaving law school, she was an associate at the Simpson Thacher & Bartlett law firm for four years, before working for telecommunications billionaire John Kluge in the 1980s,[5] helping him acquire small companies that held local cellular licenses.[6]
Rothschild then invested in telecoms businesses in North America and Europe, in partnership with Motorola,[6] claiming in 2012 that by the late 1990s she was making a nine-figure salary.[9]
Rothschild became Executive Vice President for Development at Metromedia Inc from 1984–1989.[citation needed] From 1989–1995, Rothschild was the majority shareholder, Chairman and CEO, of TPI Communications International, Inc., one of the largest providers of paging, wireless data and cellular telephone service in Latin America, owned with Motorola.[citation needed]
Under her management, TPI tripled its size and per-customer revenues, and cash flow grew to three times the U.S. average.[citation needed] In addition, she expanded operations from Puerto Rico into Latin America. She sold her stake in TPI to Motorola in 1995 for a figure reportedly between $80 million and $100 million.[6]
In 1995, Rothschild founded FirstMark Communications Inc in the United States, a broadband wireless company. In 1997, she sold her US interests in order to focus on international opportunities. In 1998, she founded FirstMark Communications of Europe, with the mission of building a pan-European broadband Internet company. Having secured licenses in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Finland, she built a 20,000 klm fiber network in 15 countries. The company was sold in June 2000 in a $1 billion financing, the largest private equity placement in the history of the European competitive telecommunications sector.[citation needed]
Rothschild currently serves on the Board of Directors of Estée Lauder Companies, The Economist Group,[5] Bronfman E.L. Rothschild LP and Christies International. She has also served on the Boards of Directors of Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and General Instruments, Inc.[citation needed]
Politics[edit]
From 1993–1995, Rothschild served on President Bill Clinton's National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council. From 1998–2000, she served on the US Secretary of Energy's Advisory Committee.[8]
Rothschild has donated to all of Bill and Hillary Clinton's federal races since 1992.[10] Although Rothschild was a major fund raiser for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, she transferred her support to Republican candidate John McCain when Barack Obama beat Clinton, becoming a minor celebrity on cable television at the time for attacking Obama in a series of interviews.[5]
On June 22, 2011, she hosted a fundraiser for Jon Huntsman Jr.'s presidential campaign, an event originally planned to support Mitt Romney before she had a change of heart in the early summer of 2011.[11] In the summer of 2016, she hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.[12]
Rothschild co-chaired/founded the day-long Conference of Inclusive Capitalism in London on May 27, 2014,[13] with the aim of adjusting the working of the capitalist system to work for more people and included an opening address by Prince Charles and guest speaker Bill Clinton.[14] The second conference also took place in London on June 26, 2015
Rothschild is actively involved in policy and social issues, including micro-finance and women's rights. In 2006, she was appointed as a member of the UN Advisors Group on Inclusive Financial Services.[citation needed] She serves as Chairman of the Board for the American Patrons of the Tate Gallery, FAI, and the International Advisory Board of Columbia University School of Law.[8] In addition, she serves as a Trustee of the ERANDA Foundation (a Rothschild family foundation), the Outward Bound Trust, the Alfred Herrhausen Society of International Dialogue of Deutsche Bank and the Global Commercial Microfinance Consortium Advisory Board of Deutsche Bank.[8] She also sits on the board of the McCain Institute.[15]
She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (USA), Chatham House (UK), the Institute for Strategic Studies (UK), the International Advisory Council of Asia House (UK), and the Foreign Policy Association (USA).[8]
Personal life[edit]
Rothschild has been married three times. Her first marriage was to Alexander Hartley Platt, a doctor's son from New Jersey, took place at Brick Presbyterian Church on May 20, 1978.[16]
Her second husband was Andrew Stein (born March 4, 1945), a New York politician and son of multi-millionaire businessman Jerry Finkelstein.[17] Stein is nine years older than Forester and was Manhattan Borough President at the time of their marriage on March 12, 1983[18] and together, had two children before their divorce a decade later in 1993.[19]

Benjamin Forester Stein (b. 1985),[20] a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania (2008)[21]
John ("Jake") Forester Stein (b. 1988),[20] a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania (2010)[21]

Her third husband is Sir Evelyn de Rothschild (born August 29, 1931), whom she was introduced to by Henry Kissinger at the 1998 Bilderberg Group conference in Scotland.[22] They married on November 30, 2000 in London, England,[1] after de Rothschild divorced his wife in 2000.[23] She is his third wife.[1] On the announcement of the marriage, the Rothschild couple were invited to spend their honeymoon at the White House by the Clintons.[24] The couple divide their time between homes in New York and London, the summer home on Martha’s Vineyard and the Rothschild family's historic country estate in England. By virtue of her marriage to a knight, she is known socially as Lady de Rothschild.[5]
