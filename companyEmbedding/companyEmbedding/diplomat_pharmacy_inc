The Nation’s Largest Independent Specialty Pharmacy.

Jay
Diplomat Patient








Here for you.
In 1975, we began our mission to provide personalized, high-touch care to patients with chronic and complex conditions. Today, with over 40 areas of excellence, we have expertise in oncology, immunology, hepatitis, multiple sclerosis and specialized infusion therapy, in addition to a nationwide footprint. Coordinating with the greater health care team of prescribers, payors and pharma, we provide care and support to those who need it most.
We have our internal team ready to help in every way we can—from insurance to third-party funding to just listening. If a prior authorization is needed, our dedicated benefits investigation team goes to work, leaving patients and their prescribers time to focus on more important things. If an appeal is needed, we handle that too, doing the best we can to get patients the treatments they need. If cost is an issue, our experienced funding team steps in, uncovering ways to help with copays and more.
We’re here to answers questions and address concerns. We’re here to offer a listening ear or words of encouragement. And we’re here to do whatever it takes, every day, to help our patients thrive.

Our Mission

Our Philosophy

Take good care of patients and the rest falls into place.
Dale Hagerman, Diplomat Co-founder







To us, achieving excellence means giving patients their best chance for happier lives—lives with more moments, more milestones, more memories in the making. The result isn’t just an outcome: it’s an impact. That’s why we commit to helping one patient at a time.
			






Our History


Before Diplomat, there was Ideal Pharmacy. In 1973, Dale Hagerman helped open the fourth store in the small chain in Flint, Michigan. Two years later, when his son, Phil Hagerman, graduated from college, Dale traded in his stock to buy the store. With a philosophy that focused on one patient at a time, the pharmacy expanded to a specialty pharmacy, helping patients with complex or chronic conditions. Today, Diplomat relies on its history as a company of proven innovators to set the standard for patient care. Over the years, we’ve grown to become a nationally recognized specialty pharmacy, led by Phil Hagerman, CEO and chairman, and the rest of our executive team.

About








One patient at a time. Always.
Diplomat is the nation’s largest independent specialty pharmacy, bringing personalized medication therapies to people with specialized needs such as oncology, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, HCV, blood disorders and more.
We offer innovative tools to help patients, including starter kits for side-effect management and our proprietary CarePak™ for easy dose tracking. Our systems and skillsets complement patient care—complete benefits investigations, dedicated efforts for prior authorizations and PA appeals, start-to-finish third-party funding assistance and Medicare support.
As a teammate in health, we also offer back-end patient support services for national retailers and major hospitals and specialty-care coverage to millions of lives through managed care organizations.
We exist for the patients we serve. It is an honor to support their health and help them thrive.
			





Our Mission
At Diplomat, we blend clinical excellence with a personal touch—for happier lives and health that lasts.


Our Philosophy

Take good care of patients and the rest falls into place.
Dale Hagerman, Diplomat Co-founder







To us, achieving excellence means giving patients their best chance for happier lives—lives with more moments, more milestones, more memories in the making. The result isn’t just an outcome: it’s an impact. That’s why we commit to helping one patient at a time.
			






Our History


Before Diplomat, there was Ideal Pharmacy. In 1973, Dale Hagerman helped open the fourth store in the small chain in Flint, Michigan. Two years later, when his son, Phil Hagerman, graduated from college, Dale traded in his stock to buy the store. With a philosophy that focused on one patient at a time, the pharmacy expanded to a specialty pharmacy, helping patients with complex or chronic conditions. Today, Diplomat relies on its history as a company of proven innovators to set the standard for patient care. Over the years, we’ve grown to become a nationally recognized specialty pharmacy, led by Phil Hagerman, CEO and chairman, and the rest of our executive team.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Helping cancer patients on their journey.
Oncology treatment can be complex and patients require a coordinated care team to help them through. Prescribers to care and diagnose, payors to provide adequate coverage, and pharmaceutical companies to continue researching. And as a specialty pharmacy, we’re here to lead and offer patients the support they deserve.
Our oncology program connects the entire health care team in a way that helps the patient stay on course. As part of our high-touch service, we frequently communicate with each patient to understand how they are feeling. We develop innovative packaging options that help improve adherence. We help find third-party financial assistance so each patient can access the treatments they need. We help communicate side effects, understand concerns and become an anchor for the patient.

Mallory
Diplomat Patient
In August 2015, Mallory ran 10 miles in her hometown’s annual race. It was the fifth year she’d taken part. So she was surprised when she struggled to finish. Less than a month later, she would be faced with a cancer diagnosis and a search for a bone marrow match.

Our Dedicated Oncology Team.
Oncology care requires a team with expertise and experience, but most of all, with passion for what they do. Diplomat’s oncology patient care coordinators have spent years working with cancer patients. They’ve listened to success stories large and small, shared in their experiences, and come to work every day to help in any way they can.
Read more about what drives them below.












Holly Dodge
Oncology COE Manager

 


No two patients are the same, and Holly knows it. When speaking with a patient, “I don’t ever say ‘I understand’ because I couldn’t possibly understand. Everybody is different. Everybody has different reactions to different medications, different reactions to different diseases, so I could never understand what that specific person is feeling,” she says. Instead, she prefers to simply listen, then help however she can.  
As a manager of Diplomat’s Oncology Center of Excellence, Holly trains her team to do whatever it takes. “I want to help everybody be that person that I want my family member to talk to. I think for me, one of the most unfortunate things about cancer is that I don’t know that I’ve ever met anyone that hasn’t been touched by it in some way.”
Her team shares her passion for helping patients, and it inspires her to work hard, so they can keep fighting another day. 





Kamiya Chatman
Oncology Patient Care Coordinator

 


“It’s a busy board,” according to Kamiya. When she started working in Diplomat’s translations board, it was a little overwhelming. 
Kamiya’s job involves working with an interpreter to contact patients who don’t speak English. After the interpreter gets the patient on the line, Kamiya springs into action. 
Sometimes you need to be creative, though. In certain languages, there’s not a direct correlation for particular words. “That can be a bit overwhelming,” Kamiya explains, “because you may have to partner with the translator to figure out what you should say.”
Since joining Diplomat, Kamiya says the biggest lesson she’s learned is to listen. 
“I’ve noticed that a lot of times … they’re just going through so much. Sometimes, when you’re calling them to see if they just need a refill, they can go on and share more information with you because they just want to talk about what they are going through.
“Sometimes they just need that listening ear.”





Lauren Ganapini
Pharmacy Liaison Manager, Oncology

 


For Lauren, cancer is personal. Her brother was diagnosed with leukemia in December 2010. “The more I watched my brother, his medical team and the impact his diagnosis had on my family, the more I wanted to get involved in the oncology world somehow.” 
One year after her brother’s diagnosis, she became a pharmacy liaison in oncology. 
“Once you get your medication, it’s not over for us. There are copay assistance [teams], nurse adherence teams that help with side-effect management and a pharmacist on-call 24/7. Pretty much any question that a patient or caregiver has, there’s someone at Diplomat who can answer it or help them find the answer.”
While her brother was sick, Lauren learned first-hand how important high-touch care and reliable support was. Today, he is doing well, and Lauren is determined to inspire her team to do whatever it takes to help the oncology community, one patient at a time.  





Lucas Zavadil
Pharmacy Liaison, Oncology

 


As an internal pharmacy liaison on Diplomat’s sales team, Luc works to address any concerns or needs from doctors’ offices in his territory. 
Along with his outside sales partner, Courtney, Luc says, “[we] are able to combine my direct and easy access [to] the office with all of her knowledge and face-to-face contact, so we’re working as a team alongside the office staff.”
Giving people peace of mind is a big part of Luc’s job.
“I can almost hear a sigh of relief on the other end of the phone because they know that whatever their problem is, I’m going to find a solution for them—and not because it’s my job, but because I care, too.”
If Luc had to boil Diplomat down to one sentence, it would be our philosophy: “Take good care of patients, and the rest falls into place.”
“I think that that’s huge—and I think that’s through every department.” 





Michele Ross
Oncology Order Entry Technician Supervisor

 


Two years ago, Michele’s mother died of breast cancer. 
Because of her experience with her mom, Michelle does the little things that show how deeply she cares for patients. “If I can get a patient one week, one more month, six more months on a medication so they can be with their loved ones or their loved ones [can] have them around, it’s worth it,” she says. 
After speaking with one patient who had a difficult day, she went out of her way to make sure everything was okay. “I couldn’t get [this patient] out of my head. I couldn’t sleep. I was so worried … I called her the next day and said, ‘I just wanted to see how you were.’ She said, ‘I can’t believe how kind you are.’” 
Michele says gestures like this are just one way to show our patients how much we care.  





Nathan Smith
Senior Pharmacy Liaison, Oncology

 


Every day, Nate works with prescriber offices to make sure patients are getting what they need. For him, being able to make the nurses’ or doctors’ lives easier is the most rewarding part of his job as a senior pharmacy liaison.  
“To think that Diplomat is doing such a good job for their patients that [the offices] think of us as part of their team, as an extension of their office instead of just a specialty pharmacy … that’s when you know you did your job … You’re no longer just Diplomat; you’re a part of their team as well,” he says. 
In the background, he adds, “our entire sales team down to our pharmacists, our nurses, our patient care coordinators, order-entry techs and member benefit managers, we all have the same goals in mind.” Everyone is doing their part, so Nate can coordinate with the office, allowing the doctors and nurses more time to focus on what matters most: the patient. 





Ryan Martus
Oncology Order Entry Technician

 


Every morning at 9 o’clock, Ryan gets his plan of attack. 
“I don’t know what I’ll be assigned until I get that.”
Ryan arrives early so that he can get settled in and attack the day. For him, Ryan explains, “embracing change keeps me focused.”
Ryan first came to work at Diplomat because he believes that the company’s values reflect his own. 
“Our prescription represents someone’s entire life—and their future.”
With that in mind, Ryan does everything he can to ensure each patient is taken seriously.
Once, a prescription came across his desk that didn’t seem right—for good reason. 
“I think it was a completely different dose, and it’s our standard practice [that if] you didn’t … let us know this is a dose change, we’re not sending this out.
“It’s not about getting it done as fast as possible, it’s not about getting out at 5 o’clock. It all comes back to loving patients—that’s all you have to do.”

One Patient at a Time.


Diplomat opened its doors in 1975 as a neighborhood pharmacy with one essential tenet: ‘‘Take good care of patients, and the rest falls into place.’’ Today, that tradition continues and we have focused on creating a culture that is highly focused on improving patient care and clinical adherence.
We believe that our primary focus on the patient differentiates us from our competition. We understand that the primary concerns of a patient facing a chronic and serious condition are quality of care and ease of working with the pharmacy. We believe that our detailed, well managed, high-touch patient care program that is designed to address these concerns is essential to our success. Our specialty drug dispensing and services business model creates partnerships with patients, payors, pharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians—with a focus on improving adherence and the patient experience.
