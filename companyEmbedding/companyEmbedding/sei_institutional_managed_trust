You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value 
					of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or 
					guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. A money market fund’s sponsor has no legal 
					obligation to provide financial support to the money market fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial 
					support to the money market fund at any time.
