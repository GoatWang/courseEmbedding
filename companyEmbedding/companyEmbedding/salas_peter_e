			Peter E. Salas is 61 years old.  He has been President of Dolphin Asset Management Corp. and its related companies since he founded it in 1988.  Prior to establishing Dolphin, he was with J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. for ten years, becoming Co-manager, Small Company Fund and Director-Small Cap Research.  He received an A.B. degree in Economics from Harvard in 1978.  Mr. Salas was elected to the Board of Directors on October 8, 2002 and has served as Chairman of the Board since October 12, 2004. During a portion of the last five years, Mr. Salas also served on the Board of Directors of Southwall Technologies, Inc. and Williams Controls, Inc. The business experience, attributes, and skills gained by Mr. Salas in these sophisticated financial positions, together with his service as director of other public companies and his capacity as controlling person of the Company's largest shareholder directly apply to and support his qualification as a director, and lead to the conclusion that Mr. Salas should serve as a Director of the Company.
