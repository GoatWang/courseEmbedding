About Us


From biopharmaceuticals to medical devices, diagnostics, and healthcare services, OrbiMed is scouting the globe for innovations that will help ensure humanity lives healthier, longer and more productive lives.
 We have been investing globally for over 20 years across the healthcare industry: from early-stage private companies to large multinational corporations. Our team of over 80 distinguished scientific, medical, investment and other professionals manage approximately $13 billion across public and private company investments worldwide.



 

Life Sciences Focus
The global healthcare industry sits at the intersection of several powerful long-term growth trends led by global demographics and the ineluctable advance of scientific innovation in treating disease. These trends have caused a steady increase in the level of healthcare spending in the industrialized world, led by the U.S. which now spends over 17% of its GDP on healthcare. The healthcare industry's powerful growth profile coupled with its magnitude and complexity create myriad investment opportunities.




Our Strategies
OrbiMed invests across the global healthcare industry, from seed-stage venture capital to large publicly-traded companies. Investments are made in one of three strategies: public equity, private equity, and royalty opportunities. 


Public Equity
OrbiMed manages a series of public equity funds, including long/short event-driven funds and closed-end investment trusts. We invest across all types of publicly-traded companies, from biopharmaceuticals to medical devices and healthcare services worldwide.

Private Equity
OrbiMed's private equity strategy is broad and flexible, investing from start-ups through growth equity. OrbiMed is typically a lead investor, seeking to help build our portfolio companies. Our geographic focus includes North America, Asia, Europe and Israel.

Royalty Opportunities
OrbiMed provides commercial-stage healthcare companies with non-dilutive structured debt capital. Additionally, OrbiMed can monetize royalty streams, providing valuable financing solutions to owners of intellectual property.





Firm History
To thrive, organisms need to adapt and grow. So do investment firms. Through 25 years of volatile, changing investment environments, we've embraced new opportunities and expanded our global footprint.

Item 1.


Security and Issuer



 
This Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment No. 1”) to the Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 15, 2015 (the “Statement”) relates to the ordinary shares of Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (the “Issuer”).  Certain ordinary shares are represented by American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), with each ADS representing six ordinary shares.  The ADSs are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “ADAP”.  The Issuer’s principal offices are located at 104 Park Drive, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire OX14 4RY, United Kingdom.
 
This Amendment No. 1 is being filed on a voluntary basis to report certain recent acquisitions of ordinary shares by the Reporting Persons (defined in Item 2) and to update the information in the Statement relating to the beneficial ownership of ordinary shares, including ordinary shares represented by ADSs, by the Reporting Persons.
 




Item 2.


Identity and Background



 
(a)           This Amendment No. 1 is being filed by OrbiMed Advisors LLC (“Advisors”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, OrbiMed Capital GP V LLC (“GP V”), a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, and Samuel D. Isaly (“Isaly”), an individual (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”).
 
(b) – (c)  Advisors, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, is the sole managing member of GP V, which is the sole general partner of OrbiMed Private Investments V, LP (“OPI V”), which holds ordinary shares, including certain ordinary shares represented by ADSs, as more particularly described in Item 3 below.  Advisors has its principal offices at 601 Lexington Avenue, 54th Floor, New York, New York 10022.
 
GP V has its principal offices at 601 Lexington Avenue, 54th Floor, New York, New York 10022.
 
Isaly, a natural person, is the managing member of Advisors and owns a controlling interest in Advisors.
 
The directors and executive officers of Advisors and GP V are set forth on Schedules I and II, attached hereto.  Schedules I and II set forth the following information with respect to each such person:
 
(i)           name;
 
(ii)          business address;
 
(iii)         present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business and address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted; and
 
(iv)         citizenship.
 
(d) – (e) During the last five years, neither the Reporting Persons nor any person named in Schedule I or II have been (i) convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.
 
(f)           Isaly is a citizen of the United States.
 




Item 3.


Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration



 
The ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) covered by this Amendment No. 1 have been acquired by the Reporting Persons with working capital of OPI V and capital contributions made to OPI V by its partners.
 


  


5





  


   




Item 4.


Purpose of Transaction



 
The Reporting Persons caused OPI V to acquire ordinary shares (including ordinary shares represented by ADSs) for the purpose of making an investment in the Issuer and not with the intention of acquiring control of the Issuer’s business on behalf of OPI V.
 
The Reporting Persons from time to time intend to review their investment in the Issuer on the basis of various factors, including the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic and industry conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Issuer’s ordinary shares in particular, as well as other developments and other investment opportunities.  Based upon such review, the Reporting Persons will take such actions in the future as the Reporting Persons may deem appropriate in light of the circumstances existing from time to time.  If the Reporting Persons believe that further investment in the Issuer is attractive, whether because of the market price of the ordinary shares or otherwise, they may acquire ordinary shares (including in the form of ADSs) or other securities of the Issuer either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  Similarly, depending on market and other factors, the Reporting Persons may determine to dispose of some or all of the ordinary shares currently owned by the Reporting Persons or otherwise acquired by the Reporting Persons either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
 
Except as set forth in this Amendment No. 1, the Reporting Persons have not formulated any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition of securities of the Issuer; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of the assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present Board of Directors or management of the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the Issuer’s capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; (f) any other material change in the Issuer’s business or corporate structure; (g) any change in the Issuer’s charter or bylaws or other instrument corresponding thereto or other action which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person; (h) causing a class of the Issuer’s securities to be deregistered or delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act; or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.
 




Item 5.


Interest in Securities of the Issuer



 
(a)-(b)    As of the date of this filing, the Reporting Persons may be deemed, for purposes of Rule 13d-3 of the Act, directly or indirectly, including by reason of their mutual affiliation, to be the beneficial owners of the ordinary shares described in Item 3 above.  Based upon information contained in the Issuer’s Form 20-F filed with the SEC on October 13, 2015, such ordinary shares constitute approximately 6.6% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares (including any ordinary shares represented by ADSs).  Advisors, pursuant to its authority as the sole managing member of GP V, the sole general partner of OPI V, may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the ordinary shares held by OPI V.  GP V, pursuant to its authority as the general partner of OPI V, may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the ordinary shares held by OPI V.  Isaly, pursuant to his authority as the managing member of Advisors and owner of a controlling interest in Advisors, pursuant to its limited liability company agreement, may also be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the ordinary shares attributable to Advisors.  As a result, Isaly, Advisors and GP V share the power to direct the vote and to direct the disposition of the ordinary shares described in Item 3 above.

Item 6.


Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationship with Respect to Securities of the Issuer



 
In addition to the relationships between the Reporting Persons described in Items 2, 3 and 5 above, GP V is the sole general partner of OPI V, pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of OPI V.  Advisors is the sole managing member of GP V, pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of GP V.  Pursuant to these agreements and relationships, Advisors and GP V have discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of OPI V.  Such authority includes the power of GP V to vote and otherwise dispose of securities purchased by OPI V.  The number of outstanding ordinary shares held by OPI V is 28,041,004 ordinary shares (of which 2,632,704 are represented by 438,784 ADSs).  Advisors and GP V may each be considered to hold indirectly 28,041,004 ordinary shares.  Isaly, pursuant to his authority as the managing member of, and owner of a controlling interest in, Advisors, also has shared discretionary power to direct the vote and the disposition of the securities of the Issuer held by OPI V.
 
Peter Thompson (“Thompson”), a Private Equity Partner of Advisors, has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Issuer since February 2015, and a member of the Board of Directors of Adaptimmune Limited since September 2014, and, accordingly, the Reporting Persons may have the ability to affect and influence control of the Issuer.  In connection with the Issuer’s initial public offering, Thompson was awarded immediately exercisable options to purchase 155,682 ordinary shares; the ordinary shares subject to these options are not included in the number of ordinary shares reported as held indirectly by GP V, Advisors and Isaly.  From time to time, Thompson may receive stock options or other awards of equity-based compensation pursuant to the Issuer’s compensation arrangements for non-employee directors.  Thompson is obligated to transfer any securities issued under any such stock options or other awards, or the economic benefit thereof, to the Reporting Persons, which will in turn ensure that such securities or economic benefits are provided to OPI V.
 

Registration Rights

 
OPI V and certain other stockholders of the Issuer entered into an investors’ rights agreement with Adaptimmune Limited, dated as of September 23, 2014.  This agreement was terminated on February 23, 2015 and replaced by a substantively similar agreement by and among Adaptimmune Therapeutics Limited and certain of its shareholders and Adaptimmune Limited dated February 23, 2015 (the “Investors’ Rights Agreement”).  Pursuant to the Investors’ Rights Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the parties agreed that:
 
Demand Registration Rights
 
At any time after the earlier of (i) September 23, 2017 or (ii) six months after the Issuer’s initial public offering offering, the holders of more than 50% of the registrable securities then outstanding have the right to demand that the Issuer use its best efforts to file a registration statement, provided that the anticipated aggregated offering price for such offering must exceed $10 million. The Issuer is only obligated to file up to two registration statements in connection with the exercise of demand registration rights.  In addition, the Issuer will not be required to effect a demand registration during the period that is 90 days before the Issuer’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is 180 days after the effective date of, an Issuer-initiated registration of its securities, provided that the Issuer is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause its registration statement to become effective.
 


  


7





  


 
F-3 Registration Rights
 
At any time after the Issuer becomes eligible to file a registration statement on Form F-3, any holder of registrable securities has the right to demand that the Issuer use its commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement on Form F-3 covering at least $5 million of registrable securities. The Issuer is not obligated to file more than two such registration statements in any 12-month period.  In addition, the Issuer will not be required to effect a registration on Form F-3 during the period that is 60 days before the Issuer’s good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date that is 90 days after the effective date of, an Issuer-initiated registration of its securities, provided that the Issuer is actively employing in good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause its registration statement to become effective.
 
Piggyback Registration Rights
 
The Investors’ Rights Agreement further provides that, if the Issuer proposes to register (other than in a shelf registration) any ordinary shares or ADSs representing such ordinary shares after the completion of the Issuer’s initial public offering, shareholders who have entered into the Investors’ Rights Agreement are entitled to notice of such registration and to include their registrable securities in that registration. The registration of such shareholders’ registrable securities pursuant to a company registration does not relieve the Issuer of the obligation to effect a demand registration. The managing underwriter has the right to limit the number of registrable securities included in a company registration if the managing underwriter believes it would interfere with the successful marketing of the ordinary shares or ADSs.  These rights do not apply with respect to a registration related to employee benefit plans, corporate reorganizations or certain other transactions described in Rule 145 under the Securities Act, a registration on any form that does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the registrable securities, or a registration in which the only ordinary shares being registered are ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being registered.
 
Expenses of Registration
 
Subject to limited exceptions, the Issuer will pay the registration expenses of the holders of the shares registered pursuant to the demand and piggyback registration rights described above.
 
Indemnification
 
The Investors’ Rights Agreement contains customary cross-indemnification provisions, pursuant to which the Issuer is obligated to indemnify the selling stockholders in the event of material misstatements or omissions in the registration statement attributable to the Issuer, and the selling stockholders are obligated to indemnify the Issuer for material misstatements or omissions attributable to them.
 
Termination of Registration Rights
 
OPI V’s demand and piggyback registration rights described above generally will terminate upon the earliest of: (i) the date five years following the Issuer’s initial public offering; (ii) a sale of the Issuer (as defined for purposes of the Investors’ Rights Agreement); or (iii) such time as Rule 144 or another similar exemption under the Securities Act is available for the sale of all of the ordinary shares of the Issuer (including in the form of ADSs) held by OPI V without limitation during a three-month period.
 
The foregoing description of the Investors’ Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Investors’ Rights Agreement, a copy of which is included in this Statement as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Other than as described in this Schedule 13D, to the best of the Reporting Persons’ knowledge, there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the persons named in Item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the Issuer.

Prior to that, the fund had bought more than 500,000 shares on June 15 and 16. Ascendis Pharma A/S (NASDAQ:ASND) has a market cap of $345 million and does not pay a dividend. The stock started the year in a down trend, but it quickly recovered and was in green territory at the end of January. The rally did not continue, however, and shares are currently down by 24% for the year, having ended Tuesday’s trading session at $13.74 per unit. Ascendis Pharma swung to a loss for the first quarter of 2016, as revenues tumbled by 40% year-over-year to €1.3 million ($1.46 million). The company posted a net loss of €20.5 million ($23.1 million), or €0.82 ($0.92) per share.  At the end of the first quarter, roughly 27% of Ascendis Pharma A/S (NASDAQ:ASND) common stock was held by 10 of the funds followed by Insider Monkey, down from 11 registered a quarter before. Peter Kolchinsky‘s RA Capital Management is betting big on this stock, having amassed 2.16 million shares worth $40.1 million at the end of March. Baker Bros. Advisors’ manager, Julian Baker and Felix Baker are also keeping an eye on Ascendis Pharma as their fund held 505,521 shares at the end of March, unchanged over the course of the first quarter.

NEW YORK, Sep. 7, 2016 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- OrbiMed Advisors LLC reported today that on September 6, 2016 entities affiliated with it sold (the "Sale") 620,325 common shares ("Common Shares") of Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. ("Cynapsus" or the "Issuer"), such that OrbiMed (as defined below) now collectively beneficially owns, controls and directs less than 10% of the outstanding Common Shares of Cynapsus.  The Common Shares were sold by OrbiMed Private Investments V, LP ("OPI V"). OrbiMed Capital GP V LLC ("GP V") is the sole general partner of OPI V. OrbiMed Advisors LLC ("Advisors") is the Managing Member of GP V. Mr. Samuel D. Isaly ("Isaly") is the Managing Member of Advisors. Each of OPI V, GP V and Advisors is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. OPI V, GP V, Advisors and Isaly are collectively hereinafter referred to as "OrbiMed".  As a result of the Sale, OrbiMed now collectively beneficially owns, controls and directs 1,266,497 Common Shares, comprised of 1,000,000 Common Shares and warrants to purchase 266,497 Common Shares, representing in aggregate 9.99% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (calculated based on the 12,411,483 Common Shares reported by the Issuer as being outstanding as of August 9, 2016). OrbiMed also has ownership and control over additional warrants to purchase 49,657 Common Shares (together with the warrants to purchase 266,497 Common Shares above, the "Warrants"). The Warrants contain an issuance limitation that prohibits the holder from exercising the Warrants to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise the holder (together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the "Blocker").

OrbiMed Acquires Common Shares of Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc.
			  



























































 















NEW YORK, July 7, 2016 /CNW/ - OrbiMed Advisors LLC reported today that on July 6, 2016 entities affiliated with it acquired (the "Acquisition") 480,000 common shares ("Common Shares") of Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. ("Cynapsus" or the "Issuer"), such that OrbiMed (as defined below) now collectively beneficially owns, controls and directs more than 10% of the outstanding Common Shares of Cynapsus. 
The Common Shares were acquired by OrbiMed Private Investments V, LP ("OPI V"). OrbiMed Capital GP V LLC ("GP V") is the sole general partner of OPI V. OrbiMed Advisors LLC ("Advisors") is the Managing Member of GP V. Mr. Samuel D. Isaly ("Isaly") is the Managing Member of Advisors. Each of OPI V, GP V and Advisors is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. OPI V, GP V, Advisors and Isaly are collectively hereinafter referred to as "OrbiMed".
As a result of the Acquisition, OrbiMed now collectively beneficially owns, controls and directs 1,620,325 Common Shares representing in aggregate 13.16% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (calculated based on the 12,316,441 Common Shares reported by the Issuer as being outstanding as of May 10, 2016). OrbiMed also has ownership and control over warrants to purchase 316,154 Common Shares (the "Warrants"). The Warrants contain an issuance limitation that prohibits the holder from exercising the Warrants to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise the holder (together with the holder's affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder's affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the "Blocker"). As a result of the Blocker, as of the date hereof, no Common Shares are issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. 
As of July 5, 2016, the date immediately prior to the day of the Acquisition, OrbiMed collectively beneficially owned, controlled and directed 1,240,411 Common Shares, comprised of 1,140,325 Common Shares and the Warrants, of which 100,086 Common Shares were exercisable thereunder, representing in aggregate 9.99% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (calculated based on the 12,316,441 Common Shares reported by the Issuer as being outstanding as of May 10, 2016 and the assumption that the 100,086 Common Shares exercisable under the Warrants were issued and outstanding).
The Acquisition resulted in an increase of OrbiMed collective beneficial ownership, control and direction of 3.17% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (calculated based on the 12,316,441 Common Shares reported by the Issuer as being outstanding as of May 10, 2016).
The Common Shares were acquired at a price of US$13.00 per Common Share for total consideration paid of US$6,259,200 (being C$16.91 per Common Share and total consideration of C$8,140,090 using the Bank of Canada's July 6, 2016 noon exchange rate of US$1 = C$1.3005).
OPI V acquired the Common Shares for investment purposes and may, depending on market and other conditions, or as future circumstances may dictate, from time to time, on an individual or joint basis, increase or decrease its beneficial ownership, control or direction over Common Shares of the Issuer through market transactions, private agreements, treasury issuances, exercise of the Warrants, options, other convertible securities or otherwise. 
This press release is being issued pursuant to the requirements of National Instrument 62-103 - The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues of the Canadian Securities Administrators. A copy of the report to be filed by OrbiMed in connection with the transactions described herein will be available on Cynapsus's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com, and can also be obtained by contacting Douglas Coon of OrbiMed at the telephone number listed below.
