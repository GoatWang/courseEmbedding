You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.

Voya Financial Hires Carolyn M. Johnson to Lead Annuities Business


TUESDAY, APRIL 8, 2014







WINDSOR, Conn., April 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA), which is rebranding from ING U.S., announced today that it has hired Carolyn M. Johnson as president of its Annuities business segment, effective April 7.  As an integral part of the company's Retirement Solutions operations, this segment is focused on driving growth and long-term success in the annuity and retirement income markets.
In her role, Johnson is responsible for all aspects of the Annuities segment, including product, distribution, financial management and operational performance.  She is also part of the Retirement Solutions executive leadership team, collaborating on overall business strategy and on key corporate-wide initiatives.
Johnson will report to Maliz Beams, chief executive officer of Retirement Solutions.  
"We're thrilled that Carolyn has joined our team in this role, which continues to support the alignment of the Annuity business to Voya's broader retirement strategy," noted Beams.  "This is an exciting time to be part of our organization—we're in the midst of a compelling transformation with a clear focus on advancing the retirement readiness of our clients.  Carolyn's experience and passion for the insurance and retirement income markets will further our efforts as we help customers achieve the financial security they expect and deserve."
With more than 25 years in financial services, Johnson brings a deep knowledge of the industry and significant leadership experience managing high performing businesses.  Most recently, she served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of Protective Life Corporation, where she led the life insurance and annuities businesses.  During her tenure, she oversaw the consolidation of the company's three insurance companies, serving previously as president for one of them, and had a leadership role in four acquisitions.  Earlier assignments included business, operations and marketing leadership roles with Bankers Life & Casualty Co. and several Aegon subsidiaries, including Western Reserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio, Idex Investor Services, Inc., and Aegon Alliances, Inc.
"I'm excited to join a team with such talent and commitment to improving retirement readiness in our country," said Johnson.  "Americans are beginning to realize that they bear an increasing responsibility for their own financial future.  As the savings paradigm shifts, annuities and retirement income strategies will play a growing role in helping individuals successfully live through and enjoy their retirement."
Johnson earned her B.S. in business administration from California State University, Los Angeles, and has also studied executive-level finance at Harvard Business School.  In addition to holding FINRA Series 6 and 63 licenses, Johnson has served on a number of professional association committees and charitable boards.  She was the vice chair for the LIMRA/LOMA Global board, chair of the ACLI Life Insurance Committee and a member of LIMRA's Strategic Marketing Issues Committee.  She is a director of the Alabama Board of the Red Cross and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.
As an industry leader and advocate for greater retirement readiness, Voya Financial is committed to delivering on its vision to be America's Retirement CompanyTM and its mission to make a secure financial future possible — one person, one family, one institution at a time.
