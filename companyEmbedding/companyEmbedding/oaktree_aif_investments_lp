any applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation,

collectively).

existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign limited
partnership and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which

of the Code relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in

on any Indebtedness of such Obligor or such Subsidiary and no event
or condition exists with respect to any Indebtedness of any Obligor
or any Subsidiary the principal amount of which exceeds $10,000,000
that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or
both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Indebtedness
to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before its
regularly scheduled dates of payment.

Subsidiaries with the Obligors’ officers, and (with the
consent of the Obligors, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld) to visit the other offices and properties of each Obligor
and each Subsidiary, all at such reasonable times and as often as
may be reasonably requested in writing; provided, however, that the

the Obligors shall notify other holders of Notes of such request
for a meeting or visit by any holder; and

to Prepay in Event of Change of Control .

(a) Notice of Change of
Control . In the event of the occurrence of a Change of
Control, the Company shall, within 10 days thereafter, deliver to
each holder of a Note a Section 8.3 Notice and Offer to Prepay
pursuant to Section 8.3(c), unless the Company already
delivered an earlier Section 8.3 Notice and Offer to Prepay in
respect of such Change of Control pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
below. Any prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8.3
shall be made at a prepayment price equal to the principal amount
of Notes to be prepaid, together with interest accrued thereon to
the date of prepayment, plus a premium equal to the Make-Whole
Amount.

(b) Condition to Company
Action . The Company will not take any action that consummates
or finalizes a Change of Control unless (i) not less than
thirty (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days prior
to such action, the Company shall have delivered to each holder of
a Note a Section 8.3 Notice and Offer to Prepay pursuant to
Section 8.3(c) below, and (ii) contemporaneously with
such action, it prepays all Notes required to be prepaid in
accordance with this Section 8.3.

(c) Offer to Prepay Notes . A
notice with respect to a Change of Control having occurred as
provided in Section 8.3(a) or that is expected to occur as
provided in Section 8.3(b) shall be sent to each holder within
the time periods set forth in Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b), as
applicable, and shall include an offer to prepay, in accordance
with and subject to this Section 8.3, all, but not less than
all, the Notes held by each holder (a “Section 8.3 Notice
and Offer to Prepay” ). Such Section 8.3 Notice and
Offer to Prepay shall state: (i) that such notice is delivered
pursuant to this Section 8.3(c); (ii) the proposed date
of (or, with respect to a Change of Control already having
occurred, the date thereof) and a description of the circumstances
surrounding such Change of Control; (iii) the date by which a
holder must deliver a Section 8.3(d) Response pursuant to
Section 8.3(d) hereof in order to accept prepayment; and
(iv) the date on which the Company expects to prepay the Notes
pursuant to Section 8.3(d), which prepayment date shall be
(x) in the case of a Change of Control already having
occurred, a Business Day not less than 30 days and not more than 60
days after the date of such Section 8.3 Notice and Offer to
Prepay and (y) in the case where the Change of Control has not
yet occurred, the date of the occurrence of such Change of Control
(such date as provided in each of the foregoing clauses
(x) and (y), as applicable, the “Section 8.3
Special Prepayment Date” ). No failure by the Company to
deliver a Section 8.3 Notice and Offer to Prepay to any holder
shall limit such holder’s right to exercise such election and
require the Company to effect such offer of prepayment within a
reasonable time period after such holder becomes aware of such
Change of Control.

(d) Acceptance; Rejection .
To accept prepayment pursuant to this Section 8.3 of the Notes
held by it, a holder shall deliver to the Company such
holder’s notice (a
“Section 8.3(d)

Oaktree Capital Management,

Note and Guaranty Agreement



 
Response” ) that it accepts prepayment pursuant to this
Section 8.3 with respect to the Notes held by it and
designated therein. To reject or decline prepayment pursuant to
this Section 8.3 of the Notes held by it, a holder shall
deliver a Section 8.3(d) Response that it rejects and declines
prepayment pursuant to this Section 8.3 with respect to the
Notes held by it and designated therein. Such Section 8.3(d)
Response shall be delivered to the Company on or before the tenth
(10th) day prior to the Section 8.3 Special Prepayment
Date. The Section 8.3(d) Response shall set forth the name of
such holder and the statement that it either accepts or rejects
prepayment pursuant to this Section 8.3 with respect to the
Notes designated therein. Promptly and in any event within three
(3) Business Days after receipt of a holder’s
Section 8.3(d) Response, the Company shall, by written notice
to such holder of a Note, acknowledge receipt thereof. If the
Company has delivered a Section 8.3 Notice and Offer to Prepay
to each holder and on or prior to the fifteenth (15th) day
prior to the Section 8.3 Special Prepayment Date, the Company
shall not have received a Section 8.3(d) Response from a
holder (or shall have received a Section 8.3(d) Response with
respect to some but not all the Notes held by such holder), the
Company shall promptly, but in any case within one
(1) Business Day after the commencement of such fifteen
(15) day period, deliver written notice to such holder that
all of the Notes held by such holder (or all of the Notes held by
such holder with respect to which such holder shall not have
declined prepayment in such holder’s Section 8.3(d)
Response) will be prepaid pursuant to this Section 8.3 on the
Section 8.3 Special Prepayment Date in the absence of a
rejection by such holder of such offer prior to such
Section 8.3 Special Prepayment Date. A failure by a holder to
respond to an offer to prepay made pursuant to this
Section 8.3 shall be deemed to constitute an acceptance of
such offer by such holder. Two Business Days prior to such
prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder of Notes a
certificate of a Senior Financial Officer specifying the
calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the Section 8.3
Special Prepayment Date.

(e) Deferral Pending Change in
Control . The obligation of the Company to prepay Notes
pursuant to the offers required by Section 8.3(c) and their
acceptance in accordance with Section 8.3(d) is subject to the
occurrence of the Change of Control in respect of which such offers
and acceptances shall have been made. In the event that such Change
of Control does not occur on the Section 8.3 Special
Prepayment Date in respect thereof, the prepayment shall be
deferred until, and shall be made on, the date on which such Change
of Control occurs. The Company shall keep each holder reasonably
and timely informed of (i) any such deferral of the date of
prepayment, (ii) the date on which such Change of Control and
the prepayment are expected to occur, and (iii) any
determination by the Company that efforts to effect such Change of
Control have ceased or been abandoned (in which case the offers and
acceptances made pursuant to this Section 8.3 in respect of
such Change of Control shall be deemed rescinded). In the event
that such Change of Control does not occur on the Section 8.3
Special Prepayment Date or within one hundred eighty
(180) days thereafter, the Obligors shall not permit any
Change of Control to occur unless it delivers a new
Section 8.3 Notice and Offer to Prepay and otherwise complies
anew with the provisions of this Section 8.3.

(f) “Change of
Control” Defined . For the purposes of this
Section 8.3, a “Change of Control” shall
mean: (i) the acquisition of direct or indirect beneficial
ownership by any Person or “group” (within the meaning
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules of the SEC
thereunder as in effect on the date hereof) of Capital Stock
representing more than 50% of the

aggregate ordinary voting power represented by
the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of any Obligor; or
(ii) the acquisition of Control of any Obligor by any Person
or “group” (within the meaning of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules of the SEC thereunder as in
effect on the date hereof); or (iii) the occurrence of a
“change of control” (howsoever defined) as provided in
the Principal Credit Facility or any Existing Note Agreement; other
than, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), by
(x) any beneficial owner as of the date hereof of OCGH,
(y) any officer, employee or principal of any member of the
Oaktree Operating Group or any of their respective subsidiaries
that is an equity holder of OCG or OCGH on the date hereof or is
admitted as an equity holder of OCG or OCGH after the date hereof
in the ordinary course of business, or (z) any holding company
or intermediate entity that is beneficially owned and controlled by
any Person identified in the foregoing clauses (x) and
(y).

Section 8.4. Allocation of
Partial Prepayments . In
the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to
Section 8.2, the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid
shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time outstanding
in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid
principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for
prepayment.

Section 8.5. Maturity;
Surrender, Etc . In the
case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8,
the principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and
become due and payable on the date fixed for such prepayment,
together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such
date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after
such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal
amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal
amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full
shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not be
reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid
principal amount of any Note.

Section 8.6. Purchase of
Notes . The Obligors will
not and will not permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay
or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the
outstanding Notes except (a) upon the payment or prepayment of
the Notes in accordance with this Agreement and the Notes or
(b) pursuant to an offer to purchase made by the Company or an
Affiliate pro rata to the holders of all Notes at the time
outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. Any such offer
shall provide each holder with sufficient information to enable it
to make an informed decision with respect to such offer, and shall
remain open for at least thirty (30) Business Days. If the
holders of more than 50% of the principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding accept such offer, the Company shall promptly notify
the remaining holders of such fact and the expiration date for the
acceptance by holders of Notes of such offer shall be extended by
the number of days necessary to give each such remaining holder at
least ten (10) Business Days from its receipt of such notice
to accept such offer. The Company will promptly cancel all Notes
acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment
or purchase of Notes pursuant to this Agreement and no Notes may be
issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

Section 8.7. Make-Whole
Amount .

“Make-Whole
Amount” means, with
respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect
to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called
Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no
event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the
Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following
meanings:

“Called
Principal” means,
with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be
prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or 8.3 or has become or is
declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to
Section 12.1, as the context requires.

“Discounted
Value” means, with
respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by
discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such
Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the
Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in
accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount
factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which
interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield
with respect to such Called Principal.

“Reinvestment
Yield” means, with
respect to the Called Principal of any Note, 0.50% over the yield
to maturity implied by the yield(s) reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New
York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement
Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display
designated as “Page PX1” (or such other display as may
replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most
recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities
( “Reported” ) having a maturity equal to the
Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such
Settlement Date. If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities
Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life,
then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by
(a) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond
equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice
and (b) interpolating linearly between the yields Reported for
the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S.
Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and
greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to
and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield
shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the
interest rate of the applicable Note.

If such yields are not Reported or
the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable
(including by way of interpolation), then “Reinvestment
Yield” means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury
constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which
such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day
preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any
comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant
maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such
Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such
U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such
Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be
determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S.
Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and
greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S.
Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and
less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall
be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the
interest rate of the applicable Note.

“Remaining Average
Life” means, with
respect to any Called Principal, the number of years obtained by
dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of
the products obtained by multiplying (a) the principal
component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such
Called Principal by (b) the number of years, computed on the
basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months and
calculated to two decimal places, that will elapse between the
Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the
scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.

“Remaining Scheduled
Payments” means,
with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, all payments of
such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after
the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no
payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled
due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a
date on which interest payments are due to be made under such Note,
then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment
will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such
Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date
pursuant to Sections 8.2, 8.3 or Section 12.1.

“Settlement
Date” means, with
respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which such
Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or
8.3 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable
pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

Section 8.8. Payments Due on
Non-Business Days .
Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary
notwithstanding, (a) subject to clause (b), any payment of
interest on any Note that is due on a date that is not a Business
Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without
including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the
interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; and
(b) any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount on any
Note (including principal due on the Maturity Date of such Note)
that is due on a date that is not a Business Day shall be made on
the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional
days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next
succeeding Business Day.

S ECTION  9. A FFIRMATIVE C OVENANTS .

covenant that so long as any of the Notes are
outstanding:

Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws, ordinances or governmental
rules or regulations to which each of them is subject, including,

Section 5.17, and will obtain and maintain in effect all
licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental
authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective
properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses, in
each case to the extent necessary to ensure that non-compliance
with such laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations or
failures to obtain or maintain in effect such licenses,
certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental
authorizations would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

adequate reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is
customary in the case of entities of established reputations
engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly

Fitch Affirms Oaktree at 'A'; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Oaktree at 'A'; Outlook Stable
    





November 05, 2015 01:08 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) 
      of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and its related entities (collectively 
      Oaktree) at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Approximately $850 
      million of unsecured debt is affected by these actions. A complete list 
      of ratings is detailed at the end of this release.
    

      Today's rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic peer review 
      of the alternative Investment Manager (IM) industry, which comprises 
      seven publicly rated global firms. Fitch's outlook for the sector is 
      stable, reflecting the relative stability of core operating 
      fundamentals, given the locked-in nature of a large portion of fee 
      revenue, modest but increased leverage levels, manageable near-term 
      obligations relative to available liquidity resources, increasing asset 
      under management (AUM) diversity, and investors' increasing allocation 
      to alternative investments, particularly those managed by alternative 
      IMs with strong franchises such as those included in Fitch's peer 
      review. While fund realization activity has increased significantly over 
      the last three years, leading to the amortization of existing AUM, 
      managers have continued to replace capital, and therefore fees, with 
      follow-on funds and expansion into other product categories through 
      step-out strategies, seed investments, and/or acquisitions.
    

      The variable cost structure of the alternative IMs has contributed to 
      relatively steady cash flows through cycles. Fee-related earnings before 
      interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (FEBITDA) margins had 
      been trending down in recent years, given lower fee rates on new product 
      categories, higher fundraising costs, and because the cost of doing 
      business has risen with increased regulation and administrative costs 
      associated with operating as public companies. However, FEBITDA margins 
      have turned a corner more recently as many alternative IMs have begun to 
      raise follow-on funds for newer strategies, which adds scale to the 
      platform. The FEBITDA margin for 'A' category alternative IMs averaged 
      35.5% for the trailing 12 months (TTM) ended Sept. 30, 2015, which 
      compared to a 34.9% average for 2012.
    

      Leverage levels have increased across the industry, as issuers have 
      taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue 
      long-duration funding and have also used debt financing for acquisition 
      purposes. Average leverage, defined as debt divided by FEBITDA, was 
      3.54x for 'A' category firms for the TTM ending Sept. 30, 2015, which 
      compared to an average of 2.55x at year-end 2012. Fitch believes the 
      issuances have been largely opportunistic and views the reduction in 
      refinancing risk favorably. Over time, Fitch expects leverage levels to 
      migrate toward historical averages, as cash proceeds are deployed into 
      FEBITDA-generating opportunities and recent acquisitions begin to 
      contribute to consolidated results.
    

      While core issuer fundamentals remain solid, alternative IMs continue to 
      have record levels of capital to invest at a time when conditions are 
      increasingly challenging. Therefore, there is more capital chasing fewer 
      deals, which could lead to significant fund underperformance if 
      competition bids prices up further. Outsized vintage concentration could 
      potentially exacerbate this issue. While most of the large managers have 
      operated through a variety of market cycles, and have demonstrated 
      investment restraint, pressure for returns from limited partners remains 
      high, given the length of time that interest rates have been at low 
      absolute levels. That said, a meaningful portion of the industry's 
      uncalled capital is not yet earning fees, often referred to as shadow 
      AUM, which could provide some material upside to alternative IM FEBITDA 
      as the capital is deployed.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT
    

      The rating affirmations for Oaktree reflect its strong position as a 
      global alternative IM, solid investment track record, experienced and 
      deepened management team, large base of fee-earning assets under 
      management (FAUM), strong blended management fee rate, given the absence 
      of a step-down in the management fee percentage once closed-end funds 
      enter their liquidation period, a lack of reliance on transaction and 
      monitoring fees for revenue, incentive income-generating capability, 
      growing investment income from Oaktree's investment in DoubleLine, solid 
      liquidity, and subordination of general partner interests to outstanding 
      indebtedness.
    

      Rating constraints for the alternative IM space include 'key man' risk, 
      which is institutionalized throughout many limited partnership 
      agreements; reputational risk, which can impact the company's ability to 
      raise future funds; and legal and regulatory risk, which could alter the 
      alternative asset space. Rating constraints more specific to Oaktree 
      include lower relative AUM diversity, higher exposure to net asset value 
      (NAV)-based fees, and reduced operating margins, which could impact the 
      firm's financial flexibility.
    

      FAUM amounted to $76.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2015, down about 3.4% from 
      3Q14, due largely to realizations in closed-end funds and negative 
      valuation movements in open-end funds. Open-end fund FAUM declined 5.5% 
      over the TTM ended Sept. 30, 2015, as relatively neutral net flows were 
      hurt by foreign exchange and market value declines. Closed-end FAUM is 
      down 2% year-over-year and 7.1% below year-end 2011 levels, given 
      continued realizations in legacy funds.
    

      Still, the decline in FAUM overshadows what has been a very strong 
      fundraising period for the firm. For the TTM ended Sept. 30, 2015, 
      Oaktree received $16.8 billion in closed-end capital commitments. Fitch 
      expects FAUM to grow in coming quarters, as $17.2 billion of capital was 
      raised but not yet earning management fees as of Sept. 30, 2015. Fees 
      will be turned on when funds begin their investment period or when the 
      capital is deployed, which will provide meaningful upside to Oaktree's 
      revenue.
    

      The firm's newest distressed debt funds, Oaktree Opportunities Fund X 
      and Xb, had nearly $9.9 billion of aggregate committed capital at Sept. 
      30, 2015, including $2.8 billion in Fund X, which should start its 
      investment period and, thus, full management fees in 2016.
    

      Oaktree's core operating performance was down in the first three 
      quarters of 2015 as management fees declined in-line with FAUM and core 
      compensation ticked-up. As a result, the firm's FEBITDA margin declined, 
      to 31.4%, which was slightly below the peer-group average on a TTM 
      basis. Even so, Fitch expects the firm to reach an inflection point in 
      2016, as record levels of undeployed AUM gradually begin to generate 
      fees, which will allow for margin expansion given the scalability of the 
      platform.
    

      Performance fees and investment income have come down, as Oaktree's 
      realization cycle started a bit earlier than the peer group, given its 
      credit focus. However, accrued performance fees remain strong, amounting 
      to $1.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2015, or nearly $900 million net of 
      associated compensation expense. Fitch does not view the accrual as a 
      liquid asset, but it does point to potential future income generation 
      and cash flow.
    

      Oaktree's leverage, as measured by long-term debt divided by FEBITDA, 
      amounted to 3.61x on a TTM basis at Sept. 30, 2015, which compares to 
      3.26x at year-end 2014. The uptick reflects the decline in FEBITDA. 
      However, leverage is overstated by $100 million of 2016 debt maturities 
      which were effectively pre-funded with Oaktree's 2014 senior note 
      issuance. Removing the 2016 maturities from total debt reduces leverage 
      to 3.19x, which is still above Fitch's general leverage tolerance for 
      'A' category firms of 2.5x. Fitch believes leverage may increase a bit 
      further over the next few quarters as fund realizations yield a decline 
      in management fees, but leverage is expected to decline to 2.5x or below 
      over the medium term, as capital not yet earning fees begins to generate 
      fees in 2016-17.
    

      Additionally, if Fitch were to include non-performance investment income 
      that Oaktree earns from its investment in DoubleLine, leverage would be 
      approximately 2.65x on a TTM basis, removing the 2016 maturities from 
      total debt. This income stream, which is tied largely to management 
      fees, has increased significantly over time as DoubleLine's FAUM has 
      grown. Fitch will continue to monitor the stability and predictability 
      of this income stream over time, but it has improved the firm's cash 
      flow generation in recent periods.
    

      Fitch believes Oaktree has a solid liquidity profile. At Sept. 30, 2015, 
      Oaktree had $417.2 million of balance sheet cash, $656.1 million of 
      government securities, and $500 million of borrowing capacity on its 
      bank revolver. This compares to $100 million of debt maturities in 2016 
      and $436.6 million of aggregate general partner commitments to the funds 
      as of Sept. 30, 2015.
    

      In 2Q14, Oaktree increased its standard payout ratio from 80% to 85% of 
      its distributable earnings, retaining the rest for fund co-investments, 
      possible corporate transactions, and enhanced liquidity. Fitch is 
      comfortable with the updated policy, given the firm's sound liquidity 
      position, but would expect the firm to reduce shareholder distributions 
      should corporate cash demands increase.
    

      In October 2014, Oaktree appointed its first CEO, Jay Wintrob, who had 
      been an outside director of the company since 2011 and who ran AIG's 
      life and retirement division until September 2014. Wintrob will be 
      focused on the day-to-day administration of the firm in addition to a 
      variety of strategic initiatives. Fitch believes the CEO appointment 
      reflects the growth, diversity, and continued globalization of the 
      platform and an addition to executive management depth. Given Wintrob's 
      prior experience on the board, Fitch does not expect wholesale strategic 
      changes resulting from this change.
    

      The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that management fees 
      will increase in 2016 as shadow AUM begins to generate management fees, 
      which will allow for modest margin expansion and balance sheet 
      deleveraging. The Outlook also reflects the agency's belief that Oaktree 
      will grow/retain FAUM through the raising of new and expansion of 
      existing fund strategies and retain a solid liquidity profile in order 
      to fund operations and meet co-investment commitments to the funds.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      IDRs AND SENIOR DEBT
    

      Fitch believes positive rating momentum for Oaktree is limited, given 
      its current rating levels and the nature and risk profile of the 
      business, including the impact that key man events and/or reputational 
      damage can have on the franchise and future fundraising prospects. 
      However, positive momentum could develop over time with a meaningful 
      reduction in key man risk, an increase in fund and fee diversity, 
      enhanced stability of incentive income through a variety of market 
      cycles, stronger funding diversity, and declines in leverage.
    

      Declines in investment performance, a key man event, and/or legislative 
      risk which negatively impact the company's ability to raise FAUM and 
      generate fees, meaningful increases in leverage, and/or impairment of 
      the liquidity profile could result in negative rating action.
    

      Oaktree is a global alternative investment management firm with a focus 
      on credit and contrarian, value-oriented investing. FAUM amounted to 
      $76.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2015 and total AUM was $100.2 billion. The 
      company's Class A units are listed on the NYSE under the ticker 'OAK'.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      Oaktree Capital Group, LLC
    

      Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P.
    

      Oaktree Capital I, L.P.

      Oaktree AIF Investments, L.P.

      Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.
    

      -- Long-term IDR at 'A';

      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
