History[edit]




Popular, Inc. headquarters in the Golden Mile of Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.


The bank was founded in Puerto Rico in 1893 when the island was still under Spanish administration, and was led in its early stages by Rafael Carrión, Sr.
During the 1970s, the company's commercials were very popular on Puerto Rican television: they presented a balding, middle aged man in a white tee shirt, announcing the company in a comic way. The 1970s also saw a giant step in the development of Banco Popular as Puerto Rico's biggest bank, when it bought two-thirds of the Banco de Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño.[citation needed] By buying this bank, Popular entered the credit-card industry.
During the following decades, Banco Popular put a lot of emphasis on the company's public image. It was during the 1980s, after Rafael Carrion, Sr.'s death, that Richard L. Carrión took over as President of the corporation.
In 1989, the bank introduced a children's savings service with a bear, "Populoso", as its mascot. The Club del Ahorro (or Savings Club) was (and still is) intended to encourage children to open savings accounts and keep track of their money.
1990s[edit]
The following decade started with a big development for the bank, when in 1990 it merged with Banco de Ponce, one of the largest banks in Puerto Rico. At this time, Banco Popular's holding company changed its name to BanPonce Corporation. Popular acquired Banco Roig, one of the main banks in the eastern side of the island, in 1997, entering a geographical market they had yet to succeed in.
During the late 1990s, the company began to diversify its services thanks to revisions of state laws that allowed banks certain 'privileges' related to different financial services other than banking. These years saw the birth of Popular Auto, Popular Finance, Popular Mortgage, Popular Insurance, Popular Leasing, among others.
During this time, the company created one of its flagship subsidiaries, Popular Securities. It quickly became the investment banking, retail brokerage, and institutional sales arm of Banco Popular. On the retail side, Popular Securities has an extensive network of brokers in Puerto Rico, rivaled only by Swiss giant UBS and more recently by Banco Santander. Popular Securities has additional offices in New York City, San Antonio, Houston, and Chicago.
2000s[edit]

Due to its growth in Puerto Rico, and the aggressive expansion in the United States, the company changed its name once again in 2000 to Popular, Inc., a name that goes back to the traditional roots of the corporation and which also reflects the common title in almost all of the subsidiaries of the company.
It was during this time that the company divided itself into three main subsidiary companies: Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with David Chafey, Jr. as its current president; Banco Popular North America, with Roberto Herencia as the current president; and Evertec, with Felix Villamil as its current president. Richard Carrión remained as president and CEO of the parent company, Popular, Inc.
In the 24 January 2005 issue of Fortune Magazine, Popular, Inc. was chosen as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For.
On 11 April 2005, an agreement was announced between Banco Popular North America and the New York Mets. Under the five-year agreement, Popular operated seven ATMs and displayed various advertisements at Shea Stadium. until it closed in September 2008, in favour of the new Citi Field.

Banco Popular is currently the largest bank in Puerto Rico, the largest company (public or private) in Puerto Rico, and the largest Hispanic bank in the United States[citation needed].
Recently, Popular updated its web site to be more user-friendly, with services such as SMS warnings for account balances (both from Popular and other banks), online payments for their products, other companies, and the state government (including credit cards with other banks, water utility bills, electricity bills, among others), credit card forms, and more. Banco Popular also released its new ad campaign: "En Mi Banco Se Puede" ("In my bank it's possible"), along with a series of aggressive ads targeting non-customers, consumers that have left the bank, or current customers who are starting to consider leaving the bank.
As of January, 2012, Popular, Inc. still owed $935 million to the US government Troubled Asset Relief Program.[4]
In March 2013, Popular announced it would sell a $568 million portfolio of non-performing loans to a joint venture between Caribbean Property Group and funds affiliated with Perella Weinberg Partners.[5]
In 2014, Popular Community Bank sold many of its mainland United States branches to cut costs and shore up its reserves against losses caused by foreclosures and the recession in Puerto Rico.[6] Popular decided to sell its branches in central Florida, Illinois, and southern California.[6] After the sales, Popular Community Bank would retain 49 branches in southern Florida, New Jersey, and New York.[6][7] On September 12, 2014, Harbor Community Bank purchased Popular's branches in Orlando and central Florida.[7][8] On November 7, 2014, 20 branches of Popular Community Bank in southern California will be sold to Banc of California in Irvine.[6]

History[edit]




Popular, Inc. headquarters in the Golden Mile of Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.


The bank was founded in Puerto Rico in 1893 when the island was still under Spanish administration, and was led in its early stages by Rafael Carrión, Sr.
During the 1970s, the company's commercials were very popular on Puerto Rican television: they presented a balding, middle aged man in a white tee shirt, announcing the company in a comic way. The 1970s also saw a giant step in the development of Banco Popular as Puerto Rico's biggest bank, when it bought two-thirds of the Banco de Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño.[citation needed] By buying this bank, Popular entered the credit-card industry.
During the following decades, Banco Popular put a lot of emphasis on the company's public image. It was during the 1980s, after Rafael Carrion, Sr.'s death, that Richard L. Carrión took over as President of the corporation.
In 1989, the bank introduced a children's savings service with a bear, "Populoso", as its mascot. The Club del Ahorro (or Savings Club) was (and still is) intended to encourage children to open savings accounts and keep track of their money.
1990s[edit]
The following decade started with a big development for the bank, when in 1990 it merged with Banco de Ponce, one of the largest banks in Puerto Rico. At this time, Banco Popular's holding company changed its name to BanPonce Corporation. Popular acquired Banco Roig, one of the main banks in the eastern side of the island, in 1997, entering a geographical market they had yet to succeed in.
During the late 1990s, the company began to diversify its services thanks to revisions of state laws that allowed banks certain 'privileges' related to different financial services other than banking. These years saw the birth of Popular Auto, Popular Finance, Popular Mortgage, Popular Insurance, Popular Leasing, among others.
During this time, the company created one of its flagship subsidiaries, Popular Securities. It quickly became the investment banking, retail brokerage, and institutional sales arm of Banco Popular. On the retail side, Popular Securities has an extensive network of brokers in Puerto Rico, rivaled only by Swiss giant UBS and more recently by Banco Santander. Popular Securities has additional offices in New York City, San Antonio, Houston, and Chicago.
2000s[edit]

Due to its growth in Puerto Rico, and the aggressive expansion in the United States, the company changed its name once again in 2000 to Popular, Inc., a name that goes back to the traditional roots of the corporation and which also reflects the common title in almost all of the subsidiaries of the company.
It was during this time that the company divided itself into three main subsidiary companies: Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with David Chafey, Jr. as its current president; Banco Popular North America, with Roberto Herencia as the current president; and Evertec, with Felix Villamil as its current president. Richard Carrión remained as president and CEO of the parent company, Popular, Inc.
In the 24 January 2005 issue of Fortune Magazine, Popular, Inc. was chosen as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For.
On 11 April 2005, an agreement was announced between Banco Popular North America and the New York Mets. Under the five-year agreement, Popular operated seven ATMs and displayed various advertisements at Shea Stadium. until it closed in September 2008, in favour of the new Citi Field.
Present[edit]

Popular's world headquarters are located in the San Juan's Hato Rey business district, on a stretch of a thoroughfare commonly known as Milla de Oro ("The Golden Mile") due to the number of banks headquartered in the area. Travelers who fly into the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport can appreciate Popular's landmark building below.
Banco Popular is currently the largest bank in Puerto Rico, the largest company (public or private) in Puerto Rico, and the largest Hispanic bank in the United States[citation needed].
Recently, Popular updated its web site to be more user-friendly, with services such as SMS warnings for account balances (both from Popular and other banks), online payments for their products, other companies, and the state government (including credit cards with other banks, water utility bills, electricity bills, among others), credit card forms, and more. Banco Popular also released its new ad campaign: "En Mi Banco Se Puede" ("In my bank it's possible"), along with a series of aggressive ads targeting non-customers, consumers that have left the bank, or current customers who are starting to consider leaving the bank.
As of January, 2012, Popular, Inc. still owed $935 million to the US government Troubled Asset Relief Program.[4]
In March 2013, Popular announced it would sell a $568 million portfolio of non-performing loans to a joint venture between Caribbean Property Group and funds affiliated with Perella Weinberg Partners.[5]
In 2014, Popular Community Bank sold many of its mainland United States branches to cut costs and shore up its reserves against losses caused by foreclosures and the recession in Puerto Rico.[6] Popular decided to sell its branches in central Florida, Illinois, and southern California.[6] After the sales, Popular Community Bank would retain 49 branches in southern Florida, New Jersey, and New York.[6][7] On September 12, 2014, Harbor Community Bank purchased Popular's branches in Orlando and central Florida.[7][8] On November 7, 2014, 20 branches of Popular Community Bank in southern California will be sold to Banc of California in Irvine.[6]

History[edit]




Popular, Inc. headquarters in the Golden Mile of Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.


The bank was founded in Puerto Rico in 1893 when the island was still under Spanish administration, and was led in its early stages by Rafael Carrión, Sr.
During the 1970s, the company's commercials were very popular on Puerto Rican television: they presented a balding, middle aged man in a white tee shirt, announcing the company in a comic way. The 1970s also saw a giant step in the development of Banco Popular as Puerto Rico's biggest bank, when it bought two-thirds of the Banco de Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño.[citation needed] By buying this bank, Popular entered the credit-card industry.
During the following decades, Banco Popular put a lot of emphasis on the company's public image. It was during the 1980s, after Rafael Carrion, Sr.'s death, that Richard L. Carrión took over as President of the corporation.
In 1989, the bank introduced a children's savings service with a bear, "Populoso", as its mascot. The Club del Ahorro (or Savings Club) was (and still is) intended to encourage children to open savings accounts and keep track of their money.
1990s[edit]
The following decade started with a big development for the bank, when in 1990 it merged with Banco de Ponce, one of the largest banks in Puerto Rico. At this time, Banco Popular's holding company changed its name to BanPonce Corporation. Popular acquired Banco Roig, one of the main banks in the eastern side of the island, in 1997, entering a geographical market they had yet to succeed in.
During the late 1990s, the company began to diversify its services thanks to revisions of state laws that allowed banks certain 'privileges' related to different financial services other than banking. These years saw the birth of Popular Auto, Popular Finance, Popular Mortgage, Popular Insurance, Popular Leasing, among others.
During this time, the company created one of its flagship subsidiaries, Popular Securities. It quickly became the investment banking, retail brokerage, and institutional sales arm of Banco Popular. On the retail side, Popular Securities has an extensive network of brokers in Puerto Rico, rivaled only by Swiss giant UBS and more recently by Banco Santander. Popular Securities has additional offices in New York City, San Antonio, Houston, and Chicago.
2000s[edit]

Due to its growth in Puerto Rico, and the aggressive expansion in the United States, the company changed its name once again in 2000 to Popular, Inc., a name that goes back to the traditional roots of the corporation and which also reflects the common title in almost all of the subsidiaries of the company.
It was during this time that the company divided itself into three main subsidiary companies: Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with David Chafey, Jr. as its current president; Banco Popular North America, with Roberto Herencia as the current president; and Evertec, with Felix Villamil as its current president. Richard Carrión remained as president and CEO of the parent company, Popular, Inc.
In the 24 January 2005 issue of Fortune Magazine, Popular, Inc. was chosen as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For.
On 11 April 2005, an agreement was announced between Banco Popular North America and the New York Mets. Under the five-year agreement, Popular operated seven ATMs and displayed various advertisements at Shea Stadium. until it closed in September 2008, in favour of the new Citi Field.
Present[edit]

Popular's world headquarters are located in the San Juan's Hato Rey business district, on a stretch of a thoroughfare commonly known as Milla de Oro ("The Golden Mile") due to the number of banks headquartered in the area. Travelers who fly into the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport can appreciate Popular's landmark building below.
Banco Popular is currently the largest bank in Puerto Rico, the largest company (public or private) in Puerto Rico, and the largest Hispanic bank in the United States[citation needed].
Recently, Popular updated its web site to be more user-friendly, with services such as SMS warnings for account balances (both from Popular and other banks), online payments for their products, other companies, and the state government (including credit cards with other banks, water utility bills, electricity bills, among others), credit card forms, and more. Banco Popular also released its new ad campaign: "En Mi Banco Se Puede" ("In my bank it's possible"), along with a series of aggressive ads targeting non-customers, consumers that have left the bank, or current customers who are starting to consider leaving the bank.
As of January, 2012, Popular, Inc. still owed $935 million to the US government Troubled Asset Relief Program.[4]
In March 2013, Popular announced it would sell a $568 million portfolio of non-performing loans to a joint venture between Caribbean Property Group and funds affiliated with Perella Weinberg Partners.[5]
In 2014, Popular Community Bank sold many of its mainland United States branches to cut costs and shore up its reserves against losses caused by foreclosures and the recession in Puerto Rico.[6] Popular decided to sell its branches in central Florida, Illinois, and southern California.[6] After the sales, Popular Community Bank would retain 49 branches in southern Florida, New Jersey, and New York.[6][7] On September 12, 2014, Harbor Community Bank purchased Popular's branches in Orlando and central Florida.[7][8] On November 7, 2014, 20 branches of Popular Community Bank in southern California will be sold to Banc of California in Irvine.[6]

During the 1970s, the company's commercials were very popular on Puerto Rican television: they presented a balding, middle aged man in a white tee shirt, announcing the company in a comic way. The 1970s also saw a giant step in the development of Banco Popular as Puerto Rico's biggest bank, when it bought two-thirds of the Banco de Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño.[citation needed] By buying this bank, Popular entered the credit-card industry.
During the following decades, Banco Popular put a lot of emphasis on the company's public image. It was during the 1980s, after Rafael Carrion, Sr.'s death, that Richard L. Carrión took over as President of the corporation.
In 1989, the bank introduced a children's savings service with a bear, "Populoso", as its mascot. The Club del Ahorro (or Savings Club) was (and still is) intended to encourage children to open savings accounts and keep track of their money.
1990s[edit]
The following decade started with a big development for the bank, when in 1990 it merged with Banco de Ponce, one of the largest banks in Puerto Rico. At this time, Banco Popular's holding company changed its name to BanPonce Corporation. Popular acquired Banco Roig, one of the main banks in the eastern side of the island, in 1997, entering a geographical market they had yet to succeed in.
During the late 1990s, the company began to diversify its services thanks to revisions of state laws that allowed banks certain 'privileges' related to different financial services other than banking. These years saw the birth of Popular Auto, Popular Finance, Popular Mortgage, Popular Insurance, Popular Leasing, among others.
During this time, the company created one of its flagship subsidiaries, Popular Securities. It quickly became the investment banking, retail brokerage, and institutional sales arm of Banco Popular. On the retail side, Popular Securities has an extensive network of brokers in Puerto Rico, rivaled only by Swiss giant UBS and more recently by Banco Santander. Popular Securities has additional offices in New York City, San Antonio, Houston, and Chicago.
2000s[edit]

Due to its growth in Puerto Rico, and the aggressive expansion in the United States, the company changed its name once again in 2000 to Popular, Inc., a name that goes back to the traditional roots of the corporation and which also reflects the common title in almost all of the subsidiaries of the company.
It was during this time that the company divided itself into three main subsidiary companies: Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with David Chafey, Jr. as its current president; Banco Popular North America, with Roberto Herencia as the current president; and Evertec, with Felix Villamil as its current president. Richard Carrión remained as president and CEO of the parent company, Popular, Inc.
In the 24 January 2005 issue of Fortune Magazine, Popular, Inc. was chosen as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For.
On 11 April 2005, an agreement was announced between Banco Popular North America and the New York Mets. Under the five-year agreement, Popular operated seven ATMs and displayed various advertisements at Shea Stadium. until it closed in September 2008, in favour of the new Citi Field.

Banco Popular is currently the largest bank in Puerto Rico, the largest company (public or private) in Puerto Rico, and the largest Hispanic bank in the United States[citation needed].
Recently, Popular updated its web site to be more user-friendly, with services such as SMS warnings for account balances (both from Popular and other banks), online payments for their products, other companies, and the state government (including credit cards with other banks, water utility bills, electricity bills, among others), credit card forms, and more. Banco Popular also released its new ad campaign: "En Mi Banco Se Puede" ("In my bank it's possible"), along with a series of aggressive ads targeting non-customers, consumers that have left the bank, or current customers who are starting to consider leaving the bank.
As of January, 2012, Popular, Inc. still owed $935 million to the US government Troubled Asset Relief Program.[4]
In March 2013, Popular announced it would sell a $568 million portfolio of non-performing loans to a joint venture between Caribbean Property Group and funds affiliated with Perella Weinberg Partners.[5]
In 2014, Popular Community Bank sold many of its mainland United States branches to cut costs and shore up its reserves against losses caused by foreclosures and the recession in Puerto Rico.[6] Popular decided to sell its branches in central Florida, Illinois, and southern California.[6] After the sales, Popular Community Bank would retain 49 branches in southern Florida, New Jersey, and New York.[6][7] On September 12, 2014, Harbor Community Bank purchased Popular's branches in Orlando and central Florida.[7][8] On November 7, 2014, 20 branches of Popular Community Bank in southern California will be sold to Banc of California in Irvine.[6]

First published on Thursday 6 October 2011 06.56 EDT






Apple II
Handbuilt by Steve Wozniak – the bearded sidekick to Steve Jobs – the Apple II was released in 1977, just 12 months after the very first Apple computer, the Apple I. Unlike that Apple I, which was assembled in Jobs's parents' garage, the Apple II signalled the Apple co-founder's early drive. Some years later, he was reported as saying: "My dream for the Apple II was to sell the first real packed computer." The Apple II duly became the fastest-selling personal computer of its time, fetching $79m in sales in 1979.
The first Macintosh

The Macintosh 128K was released in January 1984 "with all the showbiz of a car launch". And what a launch it was. No technology company would have dared dream about flaunting a personal computer in a multimillion-dollar Superbowl slot, but Apple did. The Macintosh 128J was different thought – it wasn't especially for business or bespectacled engineers; it was comparatively easy to use.
The iMac
Three years after his return to Apple in 1998, Jobs urged the world to "think different". But no one anticipated the iMac, the computer that kickstarted Apple's fortunes and propelled the company to where it is today. As the Guardian review from 14 May 1998 noted: "nobody who attended last week's product launch expected to find the most radical Macintosh since the original hit the streets 14 years ago … There isn't even a floppy drive."
The iPod

Unveiled a decade ago this month, the iPod is the one device that transformed Apple from a computer company into a mass-market electronics giant – and would later spark a revolution in digital music. Though many who bought it had to hack their computers to store music on it, the first-generation iPod was a stylish MP3 player boasting a 10-hour battery life and space for 1,000 songs. "Listening to music will never be the same again," said Jobs at its launch in October 2001.
The iPod nano
Steve Jobs discontinued the iPod mini at the height of its popularity in September 2005. His indefatigable drive for design and efficiency saw it replaced with the much smaller nano. Apple reinvented the nano in September 2010 with its sixth iteration. At 21.1g the new nano was 15g lighter than its predecessor and half the height.
The iPhone





 


  Facebook 
 


  Twitter 
 


  Pinterest 


Less than half a decade after the iPod, Apple was already the biggest name in digital music. After months of rumour and anticipation, Jobs, in January 2007, unveiled what would quickly become Apple's killer product. The phone was a hit with techies and non-techies alike. A typically fervent Stephen Fry reviewed the iPhone four months after its launch. "Beauty. Charm. Delight. Excitement. Ooh. Aah. Wow! Let me at it," he wrote in the Guardian. With the fifth incarnation unveiled earlier this week, the excitement has not yet dissipated.
iTunes
Until Jobs unveiled iTunes in January 2001, no one had been able to convince music label executives that people might pay for songs online. Announced at the back end of a 90-minute keynote to launch the new Macintosh, iTunes was an unexciting "all-in-one digital music program" that brought together MP3 playback, internet radio and CD writing. This week Apple began letting people access their digital music across any of their devices wirelessly. It is the beginning of Apple's cloud revolution.
The iPad
Apple's so-called "Jesus tablet" was everything that everyone didn't need on its launch in January 2010. Less than a year later, Apple had invented a new market and intentionally spawned hundreds of poor-man copycats. Dubbed "the oversized iPhone" with a 9.7in screen, Apple's lean-back device would be the saviour of the media industry. Research group Gartner last month forecast that tablet computers will see an explosion in sales over the next four years, selling 60% as many units as PCs by 2015 – and Apple's iPad will still have almost half the market by then.
iOS App Store
Apple announced a new milestone for its App Store in July this year: 15bn downloads (of more than 500,000 apps) since it launched in July 2008. The App Store has become the cornerstone to the iPhone's success, with the world's media giants all scrambling for a prominent place on the smartphone of choice – and spawning a new market for software developers. Pundits called it the future of mobile consumption, and Apple has since expanded its App Store to OS X computers, potentially ushering in a new age of software development.
One more thing: Apple stores
Apple opened its first retail store on 19 May 2001, in Glendale, California. As of July this year, Apple had opened more than 350 stores worldwide, with the largest in London's Covent Garden. Most thought Apple's move into physical retail space was madness – but they did not foresee that the philosophy, design and layout of the stores would encapsulate what drives Jobs. Customers have since flocked to the Genius Bar.
