Tortoise MLP & Pipeline Fund 
Tortoise Select Opportunity Fund

 
Before investing in the fund, investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and risk tolerance. The fund’s investment objective, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The summary and statutory prospectus contains this and other important information about the fund. Copies of the fund’s prospectus may be obtained by calling 855-TCA-FUND (855-822-3863) or visiting www.tortoiseadvisors.com. Read it carefully before investing.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history without adjustment for sales load. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars, and the bottom 10% receive one star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-year, five-year and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36 - 59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60 - 119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. As of 3/31/2017, TORTX/TORIX was rated against the following number of Energy Limited Partnership funds over the following periods: 76 and 31 for the three-year and five-year time period. TORTX/TORIX received four stars and five stars for those periods, respectively. This rating is specific to TORTX/TORIX and does not apply to other share classes of the fund. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Tortoise Capital Advisors is an investment manager specializing in listed energy investments. Tortoise is considered a pioneer in managing portfolios of master limited partnership (MLP) securities and other energy companies for individual, institutional and closed-end fund investors. For additional information, please call 855-TCA-FUND (855-822-3863) or email info@tortoiseadvisors.com.
Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.
Before investing in the funds, investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and risk tolerance. The funds’ investment objective, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The statutory prospectuses and the summary prospectuses (click here) contain this and other important information about the funds. Copies of the funds’ prospectus may be obtained by calling 855-TCA-FUND. Read it carefully before investing.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The funds are non-diversified, meaning they may concentrate their assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the funds are more exposed to individual stock volatility than diversified funds. Investing in specific sectors such as North American energy may involve greater risk and volatility than less concentrated investments. Risks include, but are not limited to, risks associated with energy investments, including upstream energy companies, midstream companies, downstream companies, energy company beneficiaries, MLPs, MLP affiliates, commodity price volatility, supply and demand, regulatory, environmental, operating, capital markets, terrorism, natural disaster and climate change risks. The tax benefits received by an investor investing in the funds differ from that of a direct investment in an MLP by an investor. The value of the funds' investments in an MLP will depend largely on the MLP's treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation then its income would be subject to federal taxation, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to the funds which could result in a reduction of the funds' values. Investments in foreign companies involve risk not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers, including risks related to political, social and economic developments abroad, differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements, tax risk and market practices, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. The funds invest in large, small and mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. The funds may also write call options which may limit the funds' abilities to profit from increases in the market value of a security, but cause it to retain the risk of loss should the price of the security decline. Some funds may invest in other derivatives including options, futures and swap agreements, which can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value, and changes in the value of a derivative held by the funds may not correlate with the underlying instrument or the fund's other investments and can include additional risks such as liquidity risk, leverage risk and counterparty risk that are possibly greater than risks associated with investing directly in the underlying investments. Some funds may engage in short sales and in doing so are subject to the risk that they may not always be able to borrow a security, or close out a short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price.
Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell any shares of the fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
Nothing contained in this communication constitutes tax, legal or investment advice. Investors must consult their tax adviser or legal counsel for advice and information concerning their particular situation.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This data is provided for information only and is not intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. As with any other stock, total return and market value will fluctuate so that an investment, when sold, may be worth more or less than its original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only. Due to market volatility, current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market value.
All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal. You should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For this and other important information, please refer to the most recent closed-end fund prospectus supplement, if applicable, and its accompanying prospectus. Read it carefully before investing. 
Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell any shares of a fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. Announces Sale of Controlling Interest to Mariner Holdings and Tortoise Managers

Strategic partnership to build value for asset management clients with innovative products and thought leadership 
  	  LEAWOOD, Kan. — June 3, 2009 — Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. (Tortoise) the adviser of Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Corp., Tortoise Energy Capital Corp., Tortoise North American Energy Corp., and Tortoise Capital Resources Corp. (NYSE: TYG, TYY, TYN and TTO, respectively), today announced that senior management of Tortoise have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire, along with Mariner Holdings, LLC (Mariner), all of the ownership interests in Tortoise from Kansas City Equity Partners (KCEP) and affiliates of KCEP and Fountain Capital Management. Mariner will purchase a majority stake in Tortoise, with the intention to provide growth capital and resources, and serve as a complementary strategic partner in the asset management business.

Tortoise Managing Directors, Kevin Birzer, Zachary Hamel, Ken Malvey, Terry Matlack and David Schulte, will own approximately 35 percent of Tortoise and have agreed to employment contracts. Management of Tortoise, its Investment Committee and its funds will remain unchanged. Tortoise has also initiated an equity ownership plan in which four additional senior Tortoise employees will purchase equity.

"We are pleased to announce our partnership with Mariner, a well-capitalized firm in our home town," said Mr. Birzer. "This strategic combination of two entrepreneurial companies will provide a dynamic asset management team dedicated to providing clients with innovative products and industry-leading service."

The agreement helps propel Mariner further into the asset management business, a key pillar of its strategic vision. Mariner plans to accomplish this through additional product offerings, distribution capabilities and an expanded client base. "Tortoise will strengthen our asset management capabilities, and fits our long-term strategy to create a world-class asset management business," said Marty Bicknell, Chairman and CEO of Mariner. "Over the past two years we have been methodically building our capabilities in the industry, and this agreement will take our combined assets under management to $3 billion, including both asset management and private wealth. The Tortoise team brings significant depth, including closed-end fund and separate account development and management, portfolio management, client services and operational support, which will provide a well established platform for continued growth."

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2009 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals and the approval by the stockholders of Tortoise's funds. Having approved the transaction, the independent Board of Directors of each of the Tortoise funds has recommended that the stockholders approve a new agreement with Tortoise.

Colchester Partners acted as financial advisor to Tortoise Capital Advisors in this transaction.
