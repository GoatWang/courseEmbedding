Guiding our clients to their financial objectives

http://www.northstarinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commercial.mp4
During the Past 35 Years, We Have Developed a Research Process and a Commitment to Service that is Helping Our Clients Achieve Their Financial Goals.
We established North Star Asset Management, Inc. (NSAM) in 1996 to provide superior investment performance by focusing on internal, proprietary research and investing in high quality, consistent growth companies. We developed a vision of the way we wished to work and how we would help our clients achieve their financial goals. The result is a cohesive, agile firm that invests opportunistically and assertively.  Our success is a product of our experience, continuity, and commitment.
Prior to the establishment of North Star Asset Management, Inc., the five founding principals of the firm had worked as a team of Trust Investment Officers at Associated Bank in Neenah, Wisconsin. With an average of 20 years of investment analysis and portfolio management experience, our group has produced an enviable record of investment performance and client service. 
North Star Asset Management was founded to ensure the continuity of our team of professionals and to improve upon an already solid track record of results and service. The creation of an investment advisory firm with a limited number of clients for each portfolio manager has allowed for an enhanced level of proprietary investment research, expanded flexibility to pursue new investment opportunities, and a greater level of client communications. We remain firmly committed to our philosophy of long-term investment in a diversified portfolio of fundamentally sound, consistent growth companies.
North Star Asset Management is incorporated in Wisconsin and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NSAM advises clients in 34 states and several foreign countries.

NorthStar Asset Management, LLC – A Guiding Light for Generations







































































































 





There is a balance between risk & reward, and each day we search for it on behalf of our clients.




 
		

Precision.  Patience. Discipline. 
		


 















Retirement Income Strategies
A large majority of our clients are approaching and entering retirement.  Through the years, we have become experienced in dealing with the unique financial transition that all retirees must face.





Investment Advisory Services
The portfolio managers of NorthStar Asset Management have spent their entire careers educating and advising clients on practical investment decisions.





Employer Sponsored Retirement Plans
Our team establishes, and maintains, employer-sponsored 401(k) plans for companies with fewer than 100 employees.  We focus on employee education and service, while assisting plan sponsors with fiduciary responsibilities.







Value investing for a new generation.

It is our opinion that by creating a buffer between emotion and action, between fear and greed, we can provide a positive investing experience for our clients.




 Our Process
 

Investment strategies that revolve around our client's specific objectives and behavioral characteristics.  
We offer advisory services, and also focus heavily on education in each relationship.  When you chose to engage NorthStar Asset Management, you are making a decision for your future as a professional and as an investor.

Systematic Rebalancing
Rebalancing a portfolio is a simple and proven method to avoid drifting into an unintended investment style.  Our client’s portfolios are constantly monitored and rebalanced according to the strategy they select.



Tax-Loss Harvesting
In certain instances it can be beneficial to realize losses in an account.  This is especially true when realizing losses helps to offset capital gains.  Tax-Loss harvesting is a standard feature for accounts at NorthStar Asset Management.



Performance Reporting
It is important to understand how an investment portfolio is performing in both absolute and relative terms.  NorthStar Asset Management, LLC uses one of the most sophisticated reporting programs in existence to ensure that our clients always know where they stand.






Private Client Portal Clients of our firm can request access to the Private Client Portal.  The Portal is an online environment that allows account owners to monitor their performance, see changes as they occur, and communicate with our advisors.  The Portal also serves as a secure storage and messaging center for sensitive information.



Strategic Financial Planning
The decisions made in one investment account can easily have a ripple effect throughout an entire household.  When it is time to create a holistic strategy, our clients turn to us for our ability to model a wide range of circumstances, and assist in some of life’s biggest decisions.



Investor Personality Profile
Our investment philosophy is driven by the belief that our clients are more likely to remain committed to an investment strategy that is in harmony with their own attitudes towards risk and reward.  We create detailed investor profiles for each client, and each objective, to help guide our investment strategies.

About Us









WELCOMENorthStar began in 1990 as a public equity and fixed income manager. As our analysis of solutions broadened, shareholder activism, community investing, community engagement, and charitable giving became essential ingredients of our active portfolio management process. Our approach has been guided by our deeply-held belief that the financial system is broken, that people are suffering, and that we need to help our clients use their resources to effect change.





OUR APPROACH


NorthStar’s mission is to provide the most integrative approach to portfolio management available today. Wealth management begins with an analysis of the social, ecological, and political problems of our time and with deep conversations with our clients. These steps result in the construction of portfolios that integrate financial goals while upholding a commitment to social change.





Synthesizing our broad market outlook and the individual needs of the client, we combine direct investments in global equities, investment grade bonds, community loan funds, alternative “outside” investments and cash to create a vibrant and well-balanced portfolio.








WHAT WE DOHow We Do ItOutside InvestingPerformanceClient ServicesHow We Do ItWe carefully choose public equities from each of the major industry groups. Identifying particular strengths relative to their impact on the global community, we simultaneously acknowledge the issues, problems, and challenges unique to each company. Our goal is to find the best, financially sound and socially conscious businesses with full awareness of the limitations of any public company. We then intervene at a corporate level to improve their behavior with regard to such issues as human rights, the environment, employee relations, and corporate citizenship.Outside InvestingSome of our clients are eager to make significant investments miles away from Wall Street. Local investing, social capital investing, mission investing and direct support of projects that reflect social and environmental vision are offered through NorthStar’s Outside Investments division.PerformanceOur equity performance is measured against traditional benchmarks and is available upon request. Our overall performance is also measured against traditional financial benchmarks for balanced accounts, even though some of our investments are outside the scope of these benchmarks. We are happy to discuss our performance and metrics with any potential clients.Client ServicesNorthStar is profoundly client-centered. We form important relationships with clients around every facet of their financial lives. We introduce younger clients with inherited wealth to the opportunities and challenges of responsible investing and help them navigate family relationships and money. We help clients in the LGBT community navigate legal obstacles related to property and inheritance.














CREATING CHANGE












Shareholder Activism







Shareholder Activism



                            An integral part of the social investment process at our company, after filing our first shareholder resolution in 2001.                        











Community Investing







Community Investing



                            NorthStar clients seeking a more direct impact with their investments  invest in a variety of community loan funds.                        











Charitable Giving







Charitable Giving



                            Having a strong giving tradition provides charitable gifts that support organizations committed to progressive causes.                        











Financial Literacy







Financial Literacy



                            Financial literacy isn’t typically taught in school, yet it’s a complicated topic every adult needs to master.                        
















ABOUT USNorthStar is proud to be on the cutting edge of socially responsible investing (SRI). Our understanding of what SRI means and how it’s practiced has evolved dramatically over time.
