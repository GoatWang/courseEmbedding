Careers










Every day, the diverse family of ODEC professionals meets the increasing demand for energy and high service expectations of its members. That’s why joining ODEC is an opportunity for a career, not just a job. Since ODEC’s success depends on the skills and collective strengths of all of our employees, our culture has developed into celebrating and rewarding commitment to excellence at all levels and in all departments.
Career opportunities await for energetic individuals seeking an interesting, challenging and rewarding work environment.  We seek to recruit individuals who will carry out ODEC’s commitment to excellence and fully embrace our values which include communication, respect and teamwork.
We invite you to explore available openings, and let us know if you are interested in joining our family of skilled and dedicated energy industry professionals.





 Compensation & Benefits

Benefits are an important part of an employee’s total compensation. Together, benefits and a competitive, market-based compensation, make up an employee’s total compensation package, which assists in building a financially secure foundation for our employees and their families. View our benefits below to find out more information.


Click the items below for more details.

Competitive Salaries
ODEC has established a competitive market rate for each position within the organization based on an annual study conducted by our Human Resources Department and reviewed by a national third-party consultant.


Medical Plan
Provides protection against some of the costs of hospital, surgical and physicians’ services as well as other medical services. Full-time and regular part-time employees as well as eligible dependents are covered from the first day of employment. 


Dental Plan
As with the Medical Plan, the best protection against the high cost of dental treatment is “wellness” or preventative care. But when restorative dental work is needed it is good to know that voluntary dental protection is available from the first day of employment.


Vision Plan
As with Medical and Dental, voluntary vision insurance helps pay for many vision services ranging from routine vision care to corrective lenses.


Company Funded Pension Plan
The Retirement Security Plan is designed to provide our employees with a regular, dependable source of income at retirement. It adds to Social Security and any other retirement income a person may have. The income from the Plan comes from ODEC and VMDAEC contributions only and the interest the money earns.


401(k) Plan
Allows employees to save a portion of their retirement on a pre-tax basis and provides several different types of investment options. Eligible employees are able to enroll on the first day of the month following one month of service.


Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Savings Accounts
ODEC gives employees the opportunity to set aside pre-tax dollars for eligible health care and dependent care expenses.


Long Term Care Insurance 
Long term care insurance is a voluntary benefit which pays a monthly benefit for in-home or residential care, or an assisted living or skilled nursing home facility.


Basic Life, Supplemental Life, Dependent Life, Accidental Death And Dismemberment Insurance 
ODEC pays 100% of the premium for two times salary for basic life insurance and accidental death & dismemberment. Employees have the opportunity to purchase at their expense additional supplemental life insurance for themselves and their dependents.


Long Term Disability Insurance 
ODEC pays 100% of the premium of Long Term Disability insurance which provides a continuous source of income should the employee become disabled and unable to work.


Accident and Critical Illness Insurance 
ODEC offers employees the opportunity to purchase accident insurance which pays a benefit directly to the employee for covered injuries as well as critical illness insurance which pays a lump sum benefit directly to the employee if diagnosed with a serious condition.


Vacation
The amount of vacation that an employee receives is based on the number of full-time professional years of experience in their given field or industry which has helped the employee prepare for their current position.


Paid Holidays
Ten paid holidays are available annually.


Sick Leave
Employees can use accrued paid sick leave for their own personal illness or for caring for a dependent child, spouse, parent or spouse’s parent.


Leave Sharing Program
Allows employees to donate accrued, unused sick leave and/or vacation time to employees who would otherwise need to take leave without pay because of a catastrophic illness or injury.


Free Parking
Ample, free parking is available at our Glen Allen Office and at all of our Plant locations.


Credit Union Membership
All employees are invited to apply for membership in the Credit Union. ODEC has no direct affiliation with the Credit Union offered.


Discount
ODEC employees receive discounts from national and local vendors through our Co-op Connections Card. 


More complete descriptions can be found in the Summary Plan Descriptions (“SPDs”) and/or the insurance booklets for the Plans. Please do not rely on the descriptions provided, the SPDs, or insurance booklets alone, as the legal documents applicable to each of the plans govern the operation of the plans, all rights to benefits, and serve as the authority for all decisions concerning benefits and other plan matters.





Work/Life Balance

ODEC does not just say we have a work/life balance culture, we demonstrate it through our flex time opportunities and family friendly leave policies. Work/life balance needs will change throughout your career, so our policies offer flexibility to address the fact that no one size fits all.







Flexible Work Arrangements
ODEC offers employees, with the approval of their supervisor, the ability to adjust daily arrival and departure times within a specified range and two varieties of a compressed workweek.







Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
An EAP is offered at no cost to our employees.  We recognize that, at times, all of us have troubles and concerns  which we sometimes need outside help to resolve, because they may be affecting our health and/or work performance.  We recognize this responsibility to our employees, but we also recognize our limits of involvement in our employees' personal lives.  Since we want to help, and not intrude, we offer the EAP as a confidential source of support to our employees and their families.







Time Off Policies
ODEC recognizes the importance of families and the need for rest and relaxation. Our vacation policy allows employees to accrue vacation hours based on their years of experience, not on their years of service with ODEC. Our sick leave policy allows our employees to take sick time for not only caring for their own personal illness, but for the care of a dependent child, spouse, parent or spouse’s parent. ODEC offers ten paid holidays per year.







Educational Opportunities
We encourage maximum educational development of our employees to further professional advancement and increase contributions towards ODEC’s success. With this in mind, the full cost of tuition, textbooks, required cost-related supplies (not to exceed $100), and fees are paid with the appropriate approvals. Additionally, employees are encouraged to participate in business-related trade and professional associations with dues reimbursed.







Health and Wellness Programs
We want our employees to live a healthy, balanced lifestyle.  We offer an employee assistance program, health assessment surveys, assistance with health club membership dues, and a variety of wellness opportunities to assist our employees in maintaining or improving their health.










Community Service Volunteer Hours
ODEC recognizes "Concern for Community" as a guiding principle of our cooperative business model.  As good corporate citizens we want to help enrich our communities. We, therefore, support our employees with community service volunteer hours in their efforts to support programs that positively impact the quality of life within the communities in which we live and work.







Our Culture

At ODEC, we are committed to creating a productive, safe, and hospitable work environment. We have established and communicated Our Focus, Our Values and we attempt to integrate these in our daily work lives. Other key components that contribute to our corporate culture are:






Ethics
We are committed to upholding the highest level of ethical conduct in our business dealings & expect the same conduct from people acting on our behalf. Our Code of Ethics cannot address every ethical issue that may be encountered in employment. However, we require our employees to conduct themselves in an ethical manner avoiding improper conduct at all times even if that conduct is not explicitly prohibited.







High Performance Teams
Teams drive organizational success and at ODEC everything is accomplished by teamwork…the collective power of individuals. Many cross-functional teams are in existence today at ODEC which help us achieve our goals and objectives. People Generated Energy… five people can do the work of ten on a successful team and the ODEC management team encourages employee participation in a variety teams.







Safety & Health
Safety, security, and health are important to us. We are committed to providing a safe, secure and healthy work environment for all of our employees. We believe in full compliance with the safety and health standards contained in the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and other regulations.







Career Development
We have a culture of internal growth that recognizes superior performance. We take an active interest in furthering the job skills and career of each person who works for us. In some instances, we fund outside job-related training. When you succeed, so do we.







Rewards & Recognitions
Letting our employees know how much we appreciate them is a top priority for ODEC. Our Rewards and Recognition program is one way we demonstrate our gratitude to our employees and their contributions. Each year numerous employees are recognized through the High Voltage Award Program and our Exceeds Expectations Program. Both of these programs honor employees for their positive attitudes, behaviors and accomplishments.







Employee Relations Events
ODEC fosters the type of friendly, informal work environment that employees want and expect today. Periodic events further build the natural camaraderie found amongst our employees.











About Richmond
Ah, Richmond! When it comes to being centrally located to so many great places, there’s nowhere like the Historic Richmond Region. History buffs can find all they’d ever want to know about the beginning and transformation of this great nation right at their doorstep. Richmond is just two hours from our nation’s capital, the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains and miles of serene coastline at Virginia Beach.  Our city is a small metropolitan area where the cost of living is reasonable and long commutes are unheard of–  yet, still large enough to have great music, great restaurants and great schools. Richmond boasts cultural and arts events, including a minor league baseball team, a symphony orchestra and a professional ballet company, festivals throughout the year– including, but not limited to, Arts in the Park, the Richmond Jazz Festival, Watermelon Festival, Henrico Kite Festival, and the Richmond Greek Festival.   Did we mention the that the 17th Street Farmer’s Market is one of the oldest public markets in the nation?  Its been in existence since 1737!  And for the football fans, Richmond is the proud host of the NFL’s Washington Redskins’ training camp each summer.  There are also great museums, fantastic restaurants and plenty of places to shop. The University of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Union University call the city home. But don’t take our word for it…experience how wonderful the Richmond metropolitan area is for yourself!

Our Cooperative | Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC)

Overview







Electric cooperatives are consumer-owned membership corporations originally formed in the 1930’s and ‘40s to provide electric service to rural sections of the country. Today, there are over 900 electric cooperatives throughout 47 states that serve over 42 million people.

Incorporated in 1948, Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC) provides reliable, cost-effective, environmentally balanced, wholesale electric services to our 11 member distribution cooperatives in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.  Our core business is generating, purchasing and delivering electricity to our members.  ODEC is a not-for-profit generation and transmission cooperative that operates for the benefit of our members, who are our owners.  ODEC and our members are each governed by a Board of Directors comprised of representatives elected from and by the respective entity’s total membership.  ODEC is a not-for-profit member-owned cooperative and has no capital stock.
We follow the 7 principles of cooperatives. Qualifications for membership and the rights and obligations of our members are defined by law and established in the corporate bylaws.
ODEC’s power is provided by a combination of owned baseload and peaking power plants that use coal, natural gas and nuclear as their primary fuels, and a purchased power portfolio which includes renewable resource technologies.
At ODEC, we are dedicated to being both reliable energy providers and responsible environmental stewards.  We work hard every day to support our community while reducing our environmental footprint.  Our 11 members provide retail electric service to their member-owners who total more than 560,000 (in terms of meters served) representing a population of approximately 1.4 million.  Consumers are located in 70 counties along 59,000 miles of distribution lines that extend from Delaware and Maryland, south across Virginia to the North Carolina border, and from Virginia’s Eastern Shore to the Allegheny Highlands.
Our corporate headquarters is located in Glen Allen, Virginia.

Our Cooperative | Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC)































Skip Navigation



































Overview







Electric cooperatives are consumer-owned membership corporations originally formed in the 1930’s and ‘40s to provide electric service to rural sections of the country. Today, there are over 900 electric cooperatives throughout 47 states that serve over 42 million people.

Incorporated in 1948, Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC) provides reliable, cost-effective, environmentally balanced, wholesale electric services to our 11 member distribution cooperatives in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.  Our core business is generating, purchasing and delivering electricity to our members.  ODEC is a not-for-profit generation and transmission cooperative that operates for the benefit of our members, who are our owners.  ODEC and our members are each governed by a Board of Directors comprised of representatives elected from and by the respective entity’s total membership.  ODEC is a not-for-profit member-owned cooperative and has no capital stock.
We follow the 7 principles of cooperatives. Qualifications for membership and the rights and obligations of our members are defined by law and established in the corporate bylaws.
ODEC’s power is provided by a combination of owned baseload and peaking power plants that use coal, natural gas and nuclear as their primary fuels, and a purchased power portfolio which includes renewable resource technologies.
At ODEC, we are dedicated to being both reliable energy providers and responsible environmental stewards.  We work hard every day to support our community while reducing our environmental footprint.  Our 11 members provide retail electric service to their member-owners who total more than 560,000 (in terms of meters served) representing a population of approximately 1.4 million.  Consumers are located in 70 counties along 59,000 miles of distribution lines that extend from Delaware and Maryland, south across Virginia to the North Carolina border, and from Virginia’s Eastern Shore to the Allegheny Highlands.
Our corporate headquarters is located in Glen Allen, Virginia.
