Michael D’Ambrose: How Human Resources Gets In Its Own Way30 Sep, 2013  in  Human Resources   

Home » HR/Benefits Sector » Michael D’Ambrose: How Human Resources Gets In Its Own Way
 
 
In times of constant and significant change, it’s critical that HR align itself with what matters most to the business: earnings, productivity and product quality. In order to solidify their position as strategic business partners, HR professionals need to know how the company makes its money, be adaptable, and understand how teams interact to drive results. We asked Michael D’Ambrose, SVP and CHRO at ADM, about the importance of realigning the HR function with what matters most to the business and the key steps HR leaders should take for achieving this.
 
Why is it important for HR to truly understand the full business model of their organization?
It’s the only way for HR and HR leaders to be accepted and recognized as an important part of the business, rather than simply serving as a support function. A CEO expects and needs the CHRO to understand and be able to influence business strategy and how it ties to the human strategy.
People are what make any business successful and drive a company ahead of its com- petition. It is people that identify customer needs and develop the best ways to fill those needs. They ultimately make the company successful. HR leaders who identify and implement the people strategies needed to achieve business goals demonstrate how a company’s human strategy enables that successful business strategy.
 
What are some of the key steps in transforming HR into a more strategic business partner?
We need to be business leaders and not just business partners. When we understand what drives financial and business results for our company, we can identify how the human element impacts that company strategy. We can then use our expertise in finding the right people, putting them in the right roles and motivating them to take the right actions to carry out that strategy.
When the business strategy identifies a growth area, whether it’s a specific geography or new market segment for example, we must recruit the right people with the right skills, align them with our values, culture and goals, then lead and motivate them to deliver financial and business success.
 
HR has come a long way in the past ten years, what are some of the ways they can continue to grow and adapt to not become paper pushers once again?
I’m not sure if we have really changed that much. I know we certainly can’t relax. We have made progress in delivering the HR basics efficiently and effectively and we need to continue to do that, but we need to ensure that we continue to focus on anticipating the needs of our company. We must remain focused on proactively developing human strategies that enable the company to deliver value to shareholders while fostering a culture that keeps high-performing employees engaged, making our people a competitive advantage.
 
People think of the HR department as the back-end compliance guys, what is your vision of a true HR department?
A true HR department should be focused on ensuring that their company is equipped with top talent, performing to the best of its ability, and delivering shareholder value. That means ensuring that leaders and managers know how to be great coaches focused on constant im- provement for themselves and their employees. We must ensure employees have a clear understanding of what they can do to help the company win.
It’s also HR’s responsibility to cultivate an environment where employees are excited to come to work and under- stand what they can do every day to help the company deliver value to its customers and shareholders.
 
How can this improved, strategic HR department really better a business?
It’s about making sure we’re focused on results. Have we set up the right measurements to ensure we are making a difference in business success? What are the critical parts of the overall business strategy we’re supporting? What can we demonstrate about HR strategy and actions that are helping the company achieve those results? And if we’re not driving those results, we have to be flexible and nimble enough to change HR strategy and actions so we positively impact the business. When the human strategy and business strategy are aligned, you’re going to get better business results.
