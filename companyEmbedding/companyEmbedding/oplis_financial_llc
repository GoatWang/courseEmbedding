If we approve your application, the funds will be disbursed from our account in South Carolina. South Carolina law governing consumer loan agreements may differ from the laws of the state where you reside. Applicant is responsible for complying with all statutory obligations regarding obtaining loans by internet that may exist in their state of residence. This service may or may not be available in your particular state. If you do not want to enter into an online loan agreement subject to these terms and conditions, you should apply for this loan at a lender located in the state where you reside.

Terms And Conditions
In this Deferred Presentment Agreement ("Agreement"), the words "you or your" mean the customer identified on front of agreement. The words "Us", "We", and "Our" mean OPLIS Financial.
1. Acceptance : As set forth herein, you accept the terms and conditions as outlined in this Agreement by authorizing us to cash your check(s). This Agreement is confirmation of our agreement including the terms, which were available to you in writing at our office, on our website located at www.oplisloans.com and verbally from one of our operators prior to the completion of the transaction. You may have chosen to purchase other unattached and distinctive goods or services from us, including money transmittal, wiring services, electronic billing and payment, check creation and printing, invoicing, postage, and/or other goods or services. The purchase of such goods or services constitute(s) a separate transaction(s) from check cashing for which you were provided notice that these is/may be an additional charge.

2. Electronic Presentment of Funds : You agree to the electronic presentation by us of any funds owed and to the re-presentation of any presentations that are returned to us for any reason. Such electronic re-presentation may be for less than the original amount owed us or in any increments totaling the amount due including the maximum permissible non-sufficient funds fees charged by us.

4. WARNING ABOUT FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT : Attempting to obtain a credit transaction by providing false information, including but not limited to the use of false or altered documents and the use of another person's identity other than your own (Identity Theft), is fraudulent and, in some cases, punishable by law.

This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction in interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1. The parties agree and understand that they choose arbitration instead of litigation to resolve disputes.

What Is the Interest Rate on My Loan?Open or Close

Our maximum allowable interest rate allowed by the state is 400%, however, our interest rates are typically much lower. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the cost of the loan as a percentage of the amount borrowed and converted to an annual rate.



Is This the Same as a Payday Loan?Open or Close

Oplis loans and Payday loans are completely different. Oplis offers installment loans, which means that you can pay back your loan with manageable payments over time.  As you make these payments, both interest and principal are paid down until the loan is completely paid in full.



How Long Will I Be Paying On This Loan?Open or Close

For loans under $1,000, Oplis offers a 12-month payback and for loans $1,000 or more the payback term is 18 months. These terms keep the payments manageable and you always have the ability to pay extra or payoff the loan early with no penalties. 



What If I Want to Pay Off the Loan Early?Open or Close

With Oplis there are no pre-payment penalties.



Will I Save Money by Paying Off My Loan Early?Open or Close

Paying off your loan early will save you finance charges since interest is charged on a daily basis on the outstanding principal.



When Will My Payments Be Due?Open or Close

Oplis will schedule your first payment on your pay cycle. For instance— every other week, semi-monthly, or monthly.



Will I Receive a Reminder That My Payment is Due?Open or Close

Absolutely.  Oplis will either call, text or email you prior to your payment date. This will be your opportunity to let us know if the funds will or will not be available on that date.



What If My Payment Date Falls on a Weekend or Holiday?Open or Close

When Oplis contacts you for reminder of a payment, please respond back on the date you would like the payment made.



How Can I Make a Payment?Open or Close

 Automatic Draft: Payment is drafted out of your account on the prearranged date to ensure payment is received on time.
 Debit/Credit Card: Oplis has the ability to save your card information for the purpose of making your payments
 Money Order, Cashiers Check or Certified Check: These payments can be made to address below. If you choose to make your payment this way, please allow for the time it will take to be delivered. Send these payments five (5) days in advance to ensure an on time payment.

If you need to make any changes to your profile, such as your phone number, address, bank information, etc., contact us by phone at 866-204-6086.



What Happens If My Payment is Late or is Returned NSF?Open or Close

If we receive your payment later than your due date, interest will accrue and delay the pay off of your loan.  If a payment is returned NSF, you will be charged a $25 fee.  Always try to make your payments on time, but if you need to make any changes to your payment date, please respond to our reminder attempt at least 24 hours in advance.



What Happens If I Cannot Repay My Loan?Open or Close

In most cases, Oplis can make payment arrangements so that you do not have to default on your loan. You will need to contact us to make these arrangements. However, if you do not make a payment within ninety (90) days, you will be considered in default according to your loan agreement. We reserve the right to collect the amount owed in numerous ways including legal action.
