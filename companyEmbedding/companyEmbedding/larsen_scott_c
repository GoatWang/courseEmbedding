Dental implants offer permanent replacement for both the tooth and missing root, while eliminating the need to rely on adjacent teeth for a fixed dental bridge or the inconvenience of dentures.  Since Implants are placed directly into the jawbone, you benefit from the strength and durability required to eat all the foods you love.ImplantsDental ImplantsWe offer the best in Cosmetic Dentistry, Preventative Care, Implants, Professional Whitening, Crowns, Veneers, Root Canals, Onlays/Inlays, White Fillings and Laser Treatments.GeneralTeeth WhiteningIf first impressions are important to you, there is nothing better than a beautiful, white Smile.  If you want an instant result done in a professional setting, consider in-office bleaching with us. Our staff is trained to provide instant results with little or no pain.  You will leave our office with a whiter, brighter smile.Cosmetic DentistryRestorativeBridgesOne or more missing teeth can adversely affect your oral health, the appearance of your smile, and your facial structure.  It is important to replace missing teeth as soon as possible.  A bridge is an ideal way to replace one or more missing teeth on either side for support.FillingsVeneersMichele, like so many of our wonderful patients, has such a beautiful personality. Nevertheless, she felt like her smile was holding her back. Dr. Larsen was able to give Michele veneers to make herCrownsPorcelain inlays and Onlays preserve the maximum amount of healthy tooth structure while restoring the decaying or damaged areas.  They are durable, a conservative alternative to traditional fillings, and in some cases better than full coverage crowns.Send to PhoneLarsen Scott C245 E Broadway Ave, Jackson, WY 83001(307) 733-4778Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailLarsen Scott C245 E Broadway Ave, Jackson, WY 83001(307) 733-4778Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

WHY TOSS THE TUBE FOR GOOD?
                                

Enough TP tubes are used each year to fill the Empire State Building, twice. With Scott® Tube-Free Toilet Paper, you can get premium softness without the wasteful tube.
