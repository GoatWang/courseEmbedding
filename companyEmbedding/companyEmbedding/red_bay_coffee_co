Featured Partner - Umami Mart, Oakland

Mission Umami Mart sprouted into this world as an international food + drink blog in 2007. Over the years, it has grown into a Japanese kitchen and barware importing business, headquartered in Oakland, CA. Functional design, quality and service are all a part of the Umami Mart philosophy, reflected in every facet of the business. The Oakland shop, opened in 2012, is a curation of bar tools and glassware from Japan, as well as a bottle shop dedicated to sake and Japanese beer.
Why We Chose Red Bay Coffee We chose to partner with Red Bay Coffee because we instantly connected to Keba Konte and Kori's energy. They also have some great coffees, of course! One of our best sellers at Umami Mart is the East Fourteenth Dark Roast. As a small business in Oakland, we are thrilled to carry beans from a local roaster.

Any investment starts with the entrepreneur. Keba is not just an amazing entrepreneur - he's a good job creator, community builder and visionary leader. This kind of leadership transcends the Red Bay Coffee culture, team, and is the secret ingredient in every bean roasted out of their Oakland headquarters. If you believe in small business, good jobs, and building an equitable community invest in Red Bay Coffee and be apart of the "brewing" of something special.

Bringing Power to the People with Red Bay Coffee 
February 16, 2016
Coffee to Keba Konte is more than a carefully brewed drink with notes and aromas. It is a vehicle for economic change. The San Francisco native founded Red Bay Coffee in 2014 in Oakland after years of perfecting his barista skills that he first started to hone in on while running his first eatery, the Guerilla Café, in North Berkeley.

Vertically Integrated Specialty Coffee.
Red Bay Coffee revolves around
     excellent coffee, great service, and social impact. And to achieve all three, we've developed a business structure
     that allows us to transparently source our beans, hand-roast them in Oakland, and distribute them to over 55 partners around the Bay Area and the U.S.














Single-Origin Sourced

We've established direct trade relationships with farms from several different countries, including Tanzania and Indonesia.
  



Micro-Roasted Batches
We roast small batches in our lab
   in Oakland. This allows us to control the quality and consistency of our roasts.




Nationally Distributed
We have accounts with some of the biggest names in tech—Uber, Salesforce, Twitter—but also
     distribute to cafés around the country.







HOW WE GET OUR COFFEE TO THE PEOPLE 
About 85% of our sales come from wholesale accounts 
           while 15% is from retail 
           (online sales, farmers market, new markets, popups, and catering). You can find Red Bay Coffee
           in grocery stores, offices, restaurants, and now in our own branded franchise locations.



WHOLESALE PARTNERS






























Coffee Subscriptions












RETAIL CAFÉ LOCATIONS
Traditionally, retail coffee shop employees are paid low, minimum wages. 
    We've developed a profit-sharing model that allows workers to partake in the profits they develop—the goal is to begin paying upwards
    of $5/hour in addition to the local minimum wage.












AND GROWING FAST 
We started Red Bay Coffee in 2014, and today we're seeing an average of $53K a month in sales.
  Our wholesale partnerships with companies like Salesforce and Twitter have boosted our total revenue, up from last year by 116%.

Community & Coffee 
 Every day we strive to develop 
          beautiful coffees and a better community.
          We envision a world in which coffee is a vehicle for inclusion, social and economic empowerment, and entrepreneurship. 
  It begins with just one cup of delicious coffee.




















Grab a Cup of Joe

Red Bay is at the forefront of what we believe is the fourth wave of coffee—a firm commitment to ensuring coffee production is not only high quality and sustainable but a vehicle for inclusion and social and economic empowerment.

Every day we strive to develop beautiful coffees, fair relations, and delicious approaches to living. We focus on creating opportunities within the community at large while fostering single origin, fair trade, direct trade, organic and sustainable coffees. 

How has Red Bay Coffee earned the privilege of servicing some of the most powerful technology companies
      in the world? They love our coffee, they’re located in our back yard and there is a clear trend for the 
      tech industry to grow the diversity and inclusion footprint in their companies. A delicious solution which
      we too aim to build upon and expand nationwide.

                  How did you get started?
                  



We started in the coffee business when we opened a small cafe in North Berkeley called Guerrilla Cafe in 2006. That led to opening a second cafe Chasing Lions at CCSF which sparked an interest in digging deeper into the coffee production side of the business. There was a specialty coffee movement that began gaining momentum, and we hopped on for the ride.

I'm interested in roasted coffee for the artistic and culinary experience of it--I find the whole process fascinating. I mean if you think about it, how does a single ingredient produce so many different results in taste? Just a single coffee bean, with the addition of some variables, creates a world of flavor and complexity.

On the business side of things, the whole business model of roasting as opposed to operating a cafe is also equally interesting to me. With a cafe, a brick and mortar location, the world revolves in and out of your door. When you get on the wholesale roasting side of the industry, however, you get much more movement. You’re in and out of other people’s doors, other local businesses, and eventually other locations worldwide. We’re sourcing our coffee beans from beautiful places where they’re grown to create a beautiful experience for our customers.




                  What makes your coffee company unique?
                  



We believe in transparent sourcing where consumers are aware of where these coffee beans are coming from, the farm conditions, and the human and environmental impact. To ensure excellent quality, we continuously work on R&D (research and development) to achieve delicious coffee. There’s a lot of evaluation, scrutiny, and quality control involved in this process. We have a lot of comparison tasting to consider new coffees and to check out the landscape of the local coffee competition. The people we include in these tastings come from all over--we have a diverse set of taste testers that come from different backgrounds: both the experienced and the inexperienced are included.We do a lot of hand-holding for our accounts, especially for folks who are starting a new operation. They may not know anything about coffee, but they have passion and a vision, and we want to help them succeed. These small business owners are folks who want a coffee company that’s going to support them from from the very beginning, from designing their cafe and espresso bar to helping them buy equipment, train their staff and select which coffees to serve. We just had a couple of brand new cafes accounts open that are serving our coffee. We completed an entire ramp up and on-boarding of this process to help them build high quality coffee programs, which has been exciting.In terms of social impact, we’re doing a lot of work in direct trade with farmers, fair trade, obtaining better prices, and building a company that offers positive social and environmental impact. We’re setting up a profit sharing model with the goal of helping our employees resist some of the displacement that’s occurring in our community, as well as hiring and training some formerly incarcerated team members.



                  How exactly do you source your coffee?
                  



We have strong direct trade relationships with several companies from different countries including Tanzania where we’ve partnered with a farm called Sweet Unity Farm. It is a co-op founded by David Robinson (the younger son of the famous baseball player Jackie Robinson) who has been growing amazing coffee for around 25 years in Africa. We’re really interested in the stories of communities like that, where farmers have a livable wage. We actually send back a share of the retail price on top of the original price we paid just for the crops. In Indonesia, we have partnered with a co-op there and met farmer named Foster who’s doing some amazing work in high quality beans. Historically, farmers in the region have been exploited by coffee buyers. It becomes difficult for farmers who are trying to create a better product in these situations because they don’t have the resources necessary to experiment, innovate, and do new things. It takes much more than what they’re being paid (rock bottom commodity prices)  to grow coffee to make a real living and to generate enough incentive for them to experiment. So we agreed to pay this farmer a higher price, probably triple his normal price, for higher quality. He’s quadrupled the quality and now utilizes environmentally responsible practices taught to him by a USDA certified agriculturalist.



                  What makes the coffee itself so special?
                  



Even in our name, Red Bay coffee, we chose the color red to represent us because red is the color of the coffee cherry (coffee is a fruit which grows on a shrub and its fruit is called a cherry). These cherries are even similar to tomatoes where they start green and go through the whole kind of spectrum development. What most coffee farms do is, when most of the cherries are ripe, they'll just harvest them all with either machines or by hand. You'll get this spectrum of ripe and almost ripe and passed ripe cherries which turns into coffee. What we do is incentivize these farmers by paying them only for the ripe cherries. We know that this is extra work because they have to go pass the same tree on multiple days. We have them do this to ensure the highest quality possible. That’s the big difference on how we get our coffee.



                  How do you measure quality?
                  



Coffee is measured by taste and it’s also scored. Taste is, on one hand, a very subjective experience. You could take something and like it or dislike it but you and I are both tasting something that is, for example, clearly salty. You may or may not like salt, but what we try to do in our coffee is calibrate our palettes to that of the general scoring guide. It's kind of mind blowing that there is this scale 1-100, but in specialty coffee, it's 80-100. If it’s not above a score of 80, it doesn't even qualify. Specialty coffee by definition is higher quality coffee.By scoring coffee, you place a serious financial consequence on that product. Depending on what score it was given, the whole the value chain is impacted: the farmer, the exporter, the importer, the roaster, the cafe, etc. They’re scored based on quality, taste, after taste, mouth-feel affinity, and each of these scores add up. The more experience you have in doing this, remarkably people's’ scores come down to within a few points of each other. That’s how this process becomes more objective.



                  How do you measure the success of your product?
                  



When people try us once and then come back, buy another bag or another cup, or choose our coffee over another coffee, we can quantitatively see the success. Up to now that's been our main gauge of how we're doing in the public competition arena. We have over sixty wholesale accounts, some of which are pretty big office accounts in the tech world. We’re the coffee supplier for Uber headquarters in San Francisco, in rotation at Salesforce, Twitter, Facebook, Ideo, and Sungevity. We have a few more that we’re negotiating with.



                  Tell us about the sales process.
                  



There’s two different paths to closing these office accounts. We basically approach the food and beverage director of the company directly (internal approach) or the food service company that provides their food and coffee for them (externally). So the company can either tell the beverage/food company that they want Red Bay Coffee or we pitch the service company to convince them to use our product. We introduce who we are, and then we try to get them over to our place for coffee tasting or we submit samples. We use our network to find a way “in”. We try to find connections within those companies to help get us an introduction to the decision maker.



                  Why do customers return to Red Bay for their coffee?
                  



We lead with quality. You can develop a great brand, a great story, and a great social mission which will get many people to try your product once, but if the quality’s not really stellar or up to standard, you are not going to have repeat business. Brand and CSR will only get you so far. We strive to lead with excellent quality coffee, great service, and social mission--in that order. With that being said, I do think that customers come to us because of a combination of those three things.



                  Who are your customers?
                  



I would say about 85% is wholesale and 15% is retail (online sales, farmers market, new markets, popups, and catering). Of that 85% wholesale, approximately  40% specialty markets, 30% cafes/restaurants, 30% offices We have pretty diversified channels.



                  How do your prices compare with other brands?
                  



Our prices are more in line with companies like Sightglass and Blue Bottle because I didn't really want to compete with those companies in terms of price.  We are going after the same segment as those companies, but we are smaller than most of them (we’re not buying nearly the same volume of beans) so we don't really have the same price advantages. We’re charging as much as they are.



                  What do you get about the business that your competitors don’t?
                  



I’ve already talked about the importance of quality, brand, and impact, but I want to emphasize social impact. We value the idea of inclusivity and diversity in the workplace, and I’m starting to see other companies catch onto the idea as well in their hiring practices. We need people who come from different backgrounds with different talents in order to make a company like this be the best it can be. We’re not just impacting the world on an environmental level, but a social one as well.



                  Tell us about your profit-sharing model and how you plan to expand that moving forward.
                  



At our only retail space, we raised that capital to build the coffee bar from crowdfunding. Our agreement was that, if the public got behind and funded this campaign, we would turn over profits to the workers in order to provide a livable wage. Traditionally, retail coffee shop employees are paid low, minimum wages. There normally aren’t big margins in this industry so this was my idea to raise the needed capital and establish the cafe. We had 822 folks get behind this campaign to make it a reality. We’re in a very high profile location so it was a very high profile campaign. We’re trying to be an example for other industries and companies that there can be a different way. We would like to find a way to create an even bigger sharing model. Our projections are $5-6/hour in addition to our local minimum wage which is $12.55 and tips. We’re seeing these workers making upwards of $20/hour. We’re really trying to push for economic empowerment both here and overseas where we’re sourcing our beans from.

Some fine print:  1) These numbers include startups currently live on Wefunder if they pass their minimum target.  2) Some startups use two different laws at the same time (i.e., Regulation D and Regulation Crowdfunding).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Oakland’s Red Bay Coffee Expands Production, Teaches Farmers to Roast

Howard Bryman | March 21, 2016

The last we heard of the inspiringly progressive, diversity-driven Red Bay Coffee roasting company of Oakland, Calif., they were riding high on a Kickstarter win, fresh from securing Blue Bottle’s vacated Berkeley Farmers Market spot, and had a converted shipping container café soon to be installed. Six months later, the café has yet to be installed due to a last-minute permitting headache soon to be sorted, but the delay hasn’t slowed down progress elsewhere.
By all accounts, Red Bay is snowballing right along, and its founder Keba Konte is a busy, creative man. The company has moved out of its cramped production “dojo” and into an expansive 7,800-square-foot factory space where their Probat L12 has been joined by a refurbished Probat L5, and a purchased Probat UG-22 will arrive sometime within the coming weeks.
Decorated with a beautiful living wall with greenery in the shape of the African continent, the space at 3098 E 10th St. has already hosted events, and it neighbors a local brewery Ale Industries, as well as a cluster of 18 artists’ studios. In time the company hopes to build a retail component within the space.

The uptick in production helps supply a doubled farmer’s market footprint, as the company has since last year secured two more exclusive contracts at Bay Area markets, the Hayward Farmers Market and the Newark Farmers Market. On top of that, Red Bay has also become the official coffee provider to the offices of San Francisco-based Uber Technologies Inc., makers of the Uber app.
“I think what got us to the negotiating table was that they likes our principles of diversity and inclusion,” said Konte, adding, “What sealed the deal was the level of engagement that we’re proposing.”
Going far beyond beans and coffee, Red Bay will provide exclusive workshops for Uber employees once per month in each of their offices. Presentations will focus on everything from basic brewing at home to the complete roasting process. There will be roundtable discussions with actual coffee producers, public cuppings and more.
“They’re serious about their coffee,” said Konte. “The food and beverage directors there, they’ve got a lot of opinions, and they’re in San Francisco, there’s a lot of great coffee here. There’s a whole spectrum of tastes and demands from their workers, so we’re going to really try to tap into that interest.”
Keba Konte and David Robinson.
That’s not all Konte’s company has tapped into. On top of all this, the truly big news is that Red Bay Coffee has purchased an entire container of Tanzanian greens from Sweet Unity Farms, the 1,000-acre farm owned and directed by David Robinson, youngest son of baseball legend and political activist Jackie Robinson.
“It is, by extremely far, the most coffee we’ve ever bought at one time,” said Konte, adding that his company is the exclusive West Coast U.S. buyer of Sweet Unity’s crop for this year. Robinson has been living in Tanzania for roughly 30 years and growing coffee for 25 of them in “relative obscurity,” according to Konte, who describes Robinson as a fascinating character with whom he developed a friendship last summer.
“First and foremost, his coffee is exquisite,” said Konte. “He’s created a really vibrant coop of coffee farmers. We’ll be the only ones serving his coffee, or roasting it anyway, and he’ll be out here in September to participate in a coffee producer roasting residency.”
Konte described Robinson’s upcoming residency as the start of a new ongoing program whereby Red Bay will continue to facilitate coffee producers’ travel to their Oakland roasting HQ for exposure to the roasting, cupping and serving processes that happen here in the U.S., in order for them to experience and voice opinions about their products as they appear at the opposite end of their journey up the supply chain.

“We’ll have them help in the process of developing a profile for the coffee that they grow,” said Konte, who also hopes the farmers will contribute to presentations open to the public and to Red Bay workers for sharing perspectives on “what it means to be a coffee farmer.”
“We do a lot academic conversations around that, you know, with slideshows, and ‘this is what the coffee looks like,'” said Konte. “We can talk about those things, but it’s nothing like the farmer bringing up those things with really interesting anecdotal stories, like when they had their entire trucks loaded to the gills and they got held up at gunpoint and their entire years’ work, robbed.”
As for the profit-sharing arrangement Red Bay had hoped to initiate upon opening the container café in Oakland, it has, in the midst of the café’s delays, found another route to fruition. “That got folded into the broader business,” Konte said. “It was kind of hard to not do that.”
The plan, which will go into effect in the second quarter of 2016, is a simplified version that will set aside 10 percent of the profits of the company and split it equally amongst all of its workers. The split will be commensurate with hours worked, but not dependent on the role or position of the worker, nor will it be contingent upon performance reviews or anything else. Just a straightforward cut.
“I know other folks who are doing similar things, and they tie them into job evaluations. That was just all too much to maintain,” said Konte. “I didn’t want it to be so subjective.”

The café meanwhile — stymied by a permitting oversight related to the 2-foot-by-2-foot foundation of sorts for parking the converted container, mobile-home-style — should be open anywhere from one to three months from now, depending on how negotiations play out.
“I’ve got a really awesome team of folks here. We’re all just working as hard as we can and trying to do what we do, and do it really well,” said Konte, undaunted. “It’s easy to try to bite off a lot of projects, but we’re really doing our best to give each the attention that they deserve.”
