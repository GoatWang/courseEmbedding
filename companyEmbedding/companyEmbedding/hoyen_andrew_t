Andrew T Hoyen's Experience
Title: Director of Channel Sales For the US Market
               Company: Eastman Kodak Company
Job Details

We provide - directly and through partnerships with other innovative companies - hardware, software, consumables and services to customers in graphic arts, commercial print, publishing, packaging, electronic displays, entertainment and commercial films, and consumer products markets.

Title: 
               Company: Rochester General Hospital
Job Details
               Rochester Regional Health was formed in 2014 with the joining of Rochester General and Unity Health systems. These organizations share legacies that go back generations, to visionary physician and community leaders who had a passion for caring for the sick and injured families who lived in the region. That passion has been demonstrated repeatedly since the systems' earliest days. It was natural, therefore, that these like-minded systems - united in their missions to heal and serve people and their communities - would come together. Now, as one organization, Rochester Regional brings to its mission a broad spectrum of resources, an ability to advocate for better care, a commitment to innovation and an abiding dedication to caring for the community. In keeping with the founders' pioneering spirit, Rochester Regional has a bold vision for transforming healthcare. It is a vision that expands beyond the traditional hospital setting to help people maintain good health in their everyday lives. Although the system includes five hospitals, we serve the community as a truly integrated health services organization. Our network includes hospitals and physicians, ElderONE/PACE (Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) and home health programs, outpatient laboratories, rehabilitation programs and surgical centers, independent and assisted living centers and skilled nursing facilities. We serve families in communities across Western New York and the Finger Lakes region. This new direction is the result of years of careful planning, in anticipation of healthcare's historic transition to a value-based care model designed to improve the overall health of individuals and communities. That transition is now underway - and our network, our people and their dedication to excellence and our commitment to this region and the people who live here, all ensure that we are well-positioned to thrive in the future.

The Effects of Product Fit and Brand Fit on Memory Retention for Brand Alliances: When Less Is More

International Journal of Management and Marketing Research, v. 9 (1) p.  13-28, 2016

Date Written: 2016

Abstract
The literature on brand alliances establishes the significance of the “fit” concept.  Specifically, it has been shown that consumers evaluate the extent to which the brands and products in a brand alliance are congruent. Various articles have studied the effects of brand and product fit on attitude toward the brand alliance suggesting that stronger degrees of fit result in the most favorable outcomes. However, there is a lack of research on the effects of brand and product fit on memory retention. This research is based on concepts in cognitive psychology, leading to hypotheses that suggest that stronger fit is not always better. A 2 x 2 experiment provides support for those hypotheses.
