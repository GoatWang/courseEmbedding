			WILLIAM F. STROME, age 62, is a member of our Board of Directors, a position he has held since October 2014. Mr. Strome currently serves as a director of the Merle E. Gilliand & Olive Lee Gilliand Foundation, a position he has held since February of 2014 and is an adjunct professor at the Graduate School of Business at Duquesne University. Since May 2015, Mr. Strome has served as a director of The ExOne Company, a publicly traded manufacturing technology company. Mr. Strome previously served as Senior Vice President, Finance & Administration, of RTI International Metals, Inc. ("RTI"), from November 2007 until his retirement in April 2014. He led RTI's strategic planning activities, acquisition and divestiture initiatives, and capital procurement as well as investor relations and treasury functions. He was also responsible for RTI's information technology and insurance functions. Both The ExOne Company and RTI have been, and may continue to be, investment banking clients of our company. In 2006 and 2007, prior to joining RTI, Mr. Strome was a principal at Laurel Mountain Partners where he focused on raising acquisition financing for its principal portfolio company - Liberty Waste Services. From 2001 to 2006 Mr. Strome was a Senior Managing Director in FBR's Investment Banking group. From 1981 to 1997 he served as Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary at PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and from 1997 to 2001 he served as a Managing Director of PNC's Capital Markets broker-dealer, focusing on mergers and acquisitions as well as strategic advisory services. Mr. Strome holds an undergraduate degree in Economics from Northwestern University and a J.D. and M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh.     Based on Mr. Strome's experience as a senior executive officer of a publicly traded industrial company, his experience as a Senior Managing Director and Group Head in the investment banking industry, and his corporate governance experience as Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of a publicly-traded banking corporation, our Board has determined that Mr. Strome is qualified to serve as a director. In addition, our Board has determined that Mr. Strome's experience with accounting principles, financial reporting and evaluation of financial results qualifies him as an "audit committee financial expert" for purposes of membership on the Audit Committee.
