ILC is the parent of Data Device Corp (DDC), which supplies power control and databus products to the global military and commercial aerospace markets. Databuses help connect internal components of a computer.  DDC's products are used in aircraft such as such as F-18 fighters, C-130 Hercules transports, Boeing's (BA.N) 787 and 777X passenger planes and Airbus's (AIR.PA) A350XWB. The company's main plant is in Bohemia, New York. TransDigm said DDC is expected to have revenue of more than $200 million in 2016, with about 75 percent coming from the defense market and the rest from the commercial aircraft market. Cleveland-based TransDigm makes cockpit security components and systems, aircraft audio systems and ignition systems for military and commercial aircraft. The deal is expected to close before the end of fiscal 2016, TransDigm said.

(DDC), makes and sells microelectronic components used in data conversion and networking products (cards, software, and fiber channel switches) by the defense, space, and aerospace industries. Its oldest subsidiary, ILC Dover, was spun-off in 2011, cutting ILC's ties to engineering and making softgoods for industrial, military, and space applications (blimps, spacesuits, and chemical-biological warfare protection gear). ILC customers have included Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and NASA. Buyout firm Behrman Capital owns a majority stake in ILC.

If this is your company...



We may be able to find you a more suitable carrier for your business insurance.  We have extensive data on carriers, their coverage, and company rates.  Rather than having an agent sell you, why not find which carrier is best for your business and approach them?  Contact Us to see if there is a better fit for your business.  We are not insurance agents, and are not trying to sell you anything.  We will simply tell you some carriers that may be better suited, and suggest agents in your area.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.
