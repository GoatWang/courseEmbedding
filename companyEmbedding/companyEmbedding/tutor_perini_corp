 Panorama Tower Mat Pour Time Lapse
 W/Element Hotel Record-Setting Mat Pour Time Lapse 

Tutor Perini Building Corp is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tutor Perini Corporation (NYSE: TPC).  We are strategically located throughout the United States in New York, NY; Philadelphia, PA; Henderson, NV, Phoenix, AZ and recently opened in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  The addition of this South Florida location allows us to better serve our southeast clients.  As part of the Tutor Perini Building Group, we are consistently ranked by Engineering News-Record among the top builders in the country. 
Our affiliated building companies include:

Roy Anderson Corp
Rudolph and Sletten 

We have the capacity to self-perform much of our work, often partnering with qualified local subcontractors and Tutor Perini’s Specialty Contractor Group - experts in mechanical, electrical, HVAC, and plumbing disciplines, and Civil Group – experts in site development, excavation, and specialized foundations. 
We believe our success results from our proven philosophy, “Building Relationships on Trust,” and our ability to manage large, complex projects with aggressive fast-track schedules, elaborate designs, and advanced systems while providing accurate budgeting and strict quality control.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

History[edit]
Perini was founded in 1894 by a stonemason named Bonfiglio Perini. Under the direction of Bonfiglio's grandson, Lou Perini, the company moved into the real-estate business, developing 4,500 acres (1,800 ha) in Palm Beach County, Florida. Later real-estate ventures were less successful, leaving the company deeply in debt by the mid-1990s. In 1997, Perini recapitalized, passing control to a California-based investor group led by Los Angeles-based construction executive Ronald Tutor and investor Richard Blum.[1]
Perini was listed on the NYSE on April 1, 2004. Later that year it acquired Cherry Hill Construction, a contractor in Maryland, and in 2003 it acquired Florida-based James A. Cummings and in 2005, California-based Rudolph & Sletten, Inc.. In January 2009, the corporation acquired Philadelphia-based building contractor Keating.
While Perini maintained headquarters in Framingham, Massachusetts it commonly bid on many heavy construction projects in Massachusetts. The corporation is now headquartered in Sylmar, California. The company is heavily involved in civil infrastructure, as well as construction for the gaming and hospitality industries.
In May 2009, Perini shareholders voted to change the company's name to Tutor Perini Corporation. Subsequent to its name change, Tutor Perini Corporation strengthened its focus towards expanding its geographical footprint throughout the United States. In order to facilitate this strategy, Tutor Perini issued $300 million of Senior Notes in October 2010. Tutor Perini proceeded to acquire six companies over the next nine months. These acquisitions include:

Tutor Perini
Success Story









Now that I’m having people using Egnyte I’m receiving more requests from people saying ‘please set me up for the Egnyte app, I don’t need a local file server.’ We’re eliminating some of our distributed computing services. That’s going to make our IT operations even more efficient and cost effective in the future.
Jim Puerner, CIO
 Tutor Perini





Company Overview
Tutor Perini Corporation is a leading civil and building construction company offering diversified general contracting and design-build services to private clients and public agencies throughout the world. They have provided construction services since 1894 and have established a strong reputation globally by executing large complex projects on time and within budget, while adhering to strict quality control measures.

A Legacy of Excellence
Since 1894, Tutor Perini Corporation has executed large, complex projects both on time and on budget, while adhering to strict quality control measures. Today, the $5 billion, NYSE-traded, Los Angeles-based company has offices in the U.S., Canada, Guam and the Philippines, offering diversified general contracting and design-build services to private clients and public agencies.
Construction firms generate enormous amounts of data and Tutor Perini is no exception. On-site project teams rely heavily on networked file shares for documents such as meeting minutes, daily inspections, change order requests, requests-for-information, AutoCAD files and large PDFs. In addition to file storage, the project teams and office staff collaborate and share internally among teams and externally with third parties such as contractors, architects and engineers.
Looking for the Right Fit
The reliance on what Puerner calls “document management by email” led Tutor Perini on a search for a solution that would give the company custodianship of their files, the ability to share files in the cloud and ensure that a single source of truth was replicated back to network file shares.
“With the emergence of cloud technologies, we had employees using what were unauthorized services to meet their business needs. We didn’t have a viable enterprise solution to offer, so we consciously didn’t enforce our policy and block the use of these sites. There were many inherent problems with these services, most notably that they didn’t replicate to our network, therefore we didn’t have custodianship of our data. Additionally, the overall cost to the company for what were more than 400 one-off accounts had grown to unreasonable levels.”
The Solution
Puerner was diligent in selecting the right technology partner. He evaluated eight different solutions, including the most well known file sharing solutions. He says the choice to select Egnyte was all about the combined power of the Egnyte Connect Hybrid deployment (Storage Sync) and the ability for users at Tutor Perini headquarters, job sites and mobile workers to collaborate in a secure and efficient way.
“Egnyte was unique compared to the competition. In particular, we liked that we didn’t have to buy a third party product to do the synchronization. Once we saw Egnyte and the synchronization tools it provided we were really excited as that’s a huge differentiator. Also the integration with active directory was a big win for us.”
With the Egnyte Hybrid deployment (Egnyte Storage Sync), job site employees are now able to work on mission-critical documents in real-time and replicate changes back to the cloud without worrying about potential bandwidth restrictions associated with moving large files.
 Content is downloaded onto a local instance of Egnyte Storage Sync running at the job site. The software handles the process of downloading and uploading changes to content to the local site and then back to the cloud – creating a seamless, secure, fast and reliable connection for everyone involved with a project.
Egnyte also helped solve several other issues for Tutor Perini including:
 Latency issuesAEC firms are faced with the dual-issue of working with large files such as blueprints and dealing with bandwidth constraints. Egnyte Storage Sync helped synchronize data and ensure that mission critical files were available instantly to remote users.
Mobile access and sharingWith users across the globe, the ability for Tutor Perini users to access data is vital. With Egnyte Storage Sync, Tutor Perini now has 24/7 connectivity to business data regardless of project size or location. “Egnyte has become a staple in our job site operations now, from three guys working over mobile broadband, to over 200 people working on a multi-billion dollar project like Hudson Yards in New York.”
 Centralized permission controlAlong with collaboration by email and sharing via an obsolete FTP server, Tutor Perini had a number of users sharing and storing with unauthorized external sharing accounts. Egnyte storage sync has enabled Folder and sub-folder access and permissions to be precisely enforced across cloud and local storage systems. Puerner says reigning in the unauthorized accounts through Egnyte “saved one business unit alone more than $6,000 a month.”
The Rewards
Deployed in every business unit, from the civil building groups to the specialty contractors group, Egnyte has become the standard for Tutor Perini.
The project teams and operations groups can now access a file sharing and collaboration platform from anywhere, and the IT administrators are now able to monitor and secure sensitive information. In less than a year, Tutor Perini is already managing over 11 TB of data on Egnyte—and that number is growing.
Puerner estimates more than $250,000 per year in savings to the enterprise from the cloud sharing/storage platform alone. Additionally, Egnyte Storage Sync allowed Tutor Perini to avoid the costs of farming data from end user devices for legal discovery. “In the past, if we received a legal hold order, we would have to collect PC’s, hard-drives and look for any other unique data that existed on a device or in an unauthorized cloud service. We don’t have to worry about that manual process anymore. It’s amounted to tens of thousands of dollars saved in legal discovery costs.”

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
