Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D
 
This Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D amends and supplements
the previously filed Schedule 13D filed by Baker Bros. Advisors LP (the “Adviser”), Baker Bros. Advisors (GP) LLC (the
“Adviser GP”), Julian C. Baker and Felix J. Baker (collectively the “Reporting Persons”). Except as supplemented
herein, such statements, as heretofore amended and supplemented, remain in full force and effect. Information given in response
to each item shall be deemed incorporated by reference in all other items, as applicable. Each capitalized term used but not defined
herein has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Schedule 13D, as amended.
 
Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration
 
Item 3 of Schedule 13D is supplemented as follows:
 
The disclosure in Item 4 below is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 4. Purpose of the Transaction.
 
Item 4 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and amended, as the case
may be, as follows:
 
On January 30, 2017 the Adviser acquired beneficial ownership
of 7,000 warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares of DBV Technologies S.A. (the “Issuer”) at an exercise price of €69.75
that are immediately exercisable and expire on December 9, 2026 (the “Warrants”). The Warrants are held directly by
Michael Goller, an employee of the Adviser. The right to purchase these Warrants were granted as part of Mr. Goller’s service
on the Issuer’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Mr. Goller serves on the Board as a representative of 667,
L.P. (“667”) and Baker Brothers Life Sciences, L.P. (“Life Sciences”, and together with 667, the “Funds”)
.. The policy of the Funds and the Adviser does not permit employees of the Adviser to receive compensation for serving as a director
of the Issuer, and the Funds are instead entitled to the pecuniary interest in the Warrants. Mr. Goller has neither voting nor
dispositive power and has no direct pecuniary interest in the Warrants. If Mr. Goller leaves the Board, he will have 60 trading
days during open periods to exercise the Warrants.
 
In order to effect the acquisition of the Warrants, on
January 27, 2017, the Adviser entered into a Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with the Funds pursuant to
which 667 and Life Sciences loaned €4,104.24
and €44,755.76, respectively, to the
Adviser for the purpose of acquiring 588 and 6,412 Warrants, respectively. The loan is due January 27, 2047, or earlier if the
Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrants are sold (the “Due Date”), with interest payable through the Due Date at
a rate of 2.75% annually.
 
On January 27, 2017, Mr.Goller as an agent in his capacity
as a director of the Issuer, entered into a Proceeds Agreement (the “Proceeds Agreement”) with the Adviser pursuant
to which Mr. Goller agreed that he will remit to the Adviser any directors’ fees, consulting fees and other remuneration
that he receives from the Issuer in respect of his service as a director. In addition, Mr. Goller agreed to exercise the Warrants
at the time directed by the Adviser, and pursuant to the Proceeds Agreement, the Adviser will provide Mr. Goller with the cash
necessary for Mr. Goller to pay the exercise price for the Warrants. Further, Mr. Goller agreed to sell all or any portion of the
Ordinary Shares received from exercising the Warrants at the direction of the Adviser and thereafter to remit the gross cash proceeds
(net of brokerage commissions) from the sale of the Ordinary Shares to the Adviser. Mr. Goller also agreed not to amend or modify
the Warrants, waive any provisions of the Warrants or enter into any agreement or understanding with respect to the Warrants or
the Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrants without the prior written consent of the Adviser.
 

 
 

 
Other than through their control of the Adviser, Felix J. Baker
and Julian C. Baker have neither voting nor dispositive power and have no direct pecuniary interest in the Warrants.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Loan Agreement and the Proceeds
Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Loan Agreement
and the Proceeds Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Funds hold securities of the Issuer for investment purposes.
The Reporting Persons or their affiliates may purchase additional securities or dispose of securities in varying amounts and at
varying times depending upon the Reporting Persons’ continuing assessments of pertinent factors, including the availability
of Ordinary Shares or other securities for purchase at particular price levels, the business prospects of the Issuer, other business
investment opportunities, economic conditions, stock market conditions, money market conditions, the attitudes and actions of the
Board and management of the Issuer, the availability and nature of opportunities to dispose of securities of the Issuer and other
plans and requirements of the particular entities. The Reporting Persons may discuss items of mutual interest with the Issuer,
which could include items in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
 
Depending upon their assessments of the above factors, the Reporting
Persons or their affiliates may change their present intentions as stated above and may make suggestions to the management of the
Issuer regarding corporate financing and strategy, and may acquire or dispose of securities of the Issuer (by means of open market
purchases, privately negotiated purchases, exercise of some or all of the Warrants, or otherwise).
 
Except as otherwise disclosed herein, at the present time, the
Reporting Persons do not have any plans or proposals with respect to any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Issuer
including, without limitation, those matters described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
 
Item 5.  Interest in Securities
of the Issuer.
 
(a) and (b) Items 7 through 11 and 13 of each
of the cover pages of this Amendment No. 2 are incorporated herein by reference. Set forth below is the aggregate number of Ordinary
Shares of the Issuer directly held by each of the Funds, including Ordinary Shares owned through American Depositary Shares held
by each of the Funds, and the percentage of the Issuer’s outstanding Ordinary Shares such holdings represent. Each American
Depositary Share represents one-half of one Ordinary Shares of the Issuer. The information set forth below is based upon 24,648,828
Ordinary Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016, according to information published on the Issuer’s website on January
4, 2017. Such percentage figures are calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Pursuant to the management agreements, as amended, among the
Adviser, the Funds and their respective general partners, the Funds’ respective general partners relinquished to the Adviser
all discretion and authority with respect to the investment and voting power of the securities held by the Funds, and thus the
Adviser has complete and unlimited discretion and authority with respect to the Funds’ investments and voting power over
investments.
 
The Adviser GP, Felix J. Baker and Julian C. Baker as principals
of the Adviser GP, and the Adviser may be deemed to be beneficial owners of securities of the Issuer directly held by the Funds,
and may be deemed to have the power to vote or direct the vote of and the power to dispose or direct the disposition of such securities.
 
The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the securities
of the Issuer held by each of the Funds, and this Amendment No. 2 shall not be deemed an admission that the Reporting Persons are
the beneficial owners of such securities for purposes of Section 13(d) or for any other purpose, except to the extent that any
such Reporting Person actually exercises voting or dispositive power with respect to such securities.
 
(c) The disclosure regarding the acquisition of the Warrants
in Item 4 is incorporated herein by reference. Except as disclosed herein, none of the Reporting Persons or their affiliates has
effected any other transactions in securities of the Issuer during the past sixty days.
 
(d)  Certain securities of the Issuer are held directly
by 667, a limited partnership the sole general partner of which is Baker Biotech Capital, L.P., a limited partnership the sole
general partner of which is Baker Biotech Capital (GP), LLC. Julian C. Baker and Felix J. Baker are the controlling members of
Baker Biotech Capital (GP), LLC.
 
Certain securities of the Issuer are held directly by Life Sciences,
a limited partnership the sole general partner of which is Baker Brothers Life Sciences Capital, L.P., a limited partnership the
sole general partner of which is Baker Brothers Life Sciences Capital (GP), LLC. Julian C. Baker and Felix J. Baker are the controlling
members of Baker Brothers Life Sciences Capital (GP), LLC.

Amendment No. 22 to Schedule 13D
 
This Amendment No. 22 to Schedule 13D amends and supplements
the statements on the previously filed Schedule 13D, as amended, filed by Baker Bros. Advisors LP (the “Adviser”),
Baker Bros. Advisors (GP) LLC (the “Adviser GP”), Julian C. Baker, Felix J. Baker, FBB2, LLC (“FBB2”) and
FBB3 LLC (“FBB3”). Except as supplemented herein, such statements, as heretofore amended and supplemented, remain in
full force and effect. Information given in response to each item shall be deemed incorporated by reference in all other items,
as applicable. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Schedule 13D, as
amended.
 
The Adviser GP is the sole general partner of the Adviser. Pursuant
to management agreements, as amended, among the Adviser, Baker Brothers Life Sciences, L.P. (“Life Sciences”) and 667,
L.P. (“667”, and together with Life Sciences, the “Funds”), and their respective general partners, the
Adviser has complete and unlimited discretion and authority with respect to the Funds’ investments and voting power over
investments.
 
Item 3.	 Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
 
Item 3 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and amended, as the case
may be, as follows:
 
The disclosure regarding the purchases in Item 5(c) below is
incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 4. Purpose of the Transaction.
 
Item 4 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the
case may be, as follows:
 
The Funds hold securities of Seattle Genetics, Inc. (the “Issuer”)
for investment purposes. The Reporting Persons or their affiliates may purchase additional securities or dispose of securities
in varying amounts and at varying times depending upon the Reporting Persons’ continuing assessments of pertinent factors,
including the availability of shares of Common Stock or other securities for purchase at particular price levels, the business
prospects of the Issuer, other business investment opportunities, economic conditions, stock market conditions, money market conditions,
the attitudes and actions of the board of directors and management of the Issuer, the availability and nature of opportunities
to dispose of shares in the Issuer and other plans and requirements of the particular entities. The Reporting Persons may discuss
items of mutual interest with the Issuer, which could include items in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Schedule 13D.
 
Depending upon their assessments of the above factors, the Reporting
Persons or their affiliates may change their present intentions as stated above and they may assess whether to make suggestions
to the management of the Issuer regarding financing, and whether to acquire additional securities of the Issuer, including shares
of Common Stock (by means of open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, exercise of some or all of the Stock Options
(as defined below), or otherwise) or to dispose of some or all of the securities of the Issuer, including shares of Common Stock,
under their control.
 
Except as otherwise disclosed herein, at the present time, the
Reporting Persons do not have any plans or proposals with respect to any extraordinary corporate transaction involving the Issuer
including, without limitation, those matters described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Item 5.	Interest in Securities
of the Issuer.
 
(a) and (b) Items 7 through 11 and 13 of each
of the cover pages of this Amendment No. 22 are incorporated herein by reference. Set forth below is the aggregate number and percentage
of shares of Common Stock directly held, as of the date hereof, by each of the following based upon 140,516,451 shares of common
stock as of July 20, 2016 as reported in the Issuer’s 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 26, 2016. Such percentage figures were

The Adviser GP, Felix J. Baker and Julian C. Baker as principals of the Adviser GP, and the Adviser may be deemed to be beneficial
owners of securities of the Issuer directly held by the Funds, and may be deemed to have the power to vote or direct the vote of
and the power to dispose or direct the disposition of such securities.
 
The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the securities
held by each of the Funds, and this Amendment No. 22 shall not be deemed an admission that the Reporting Persons are the beneficial
owners of such securities for purposes of Section 13(d) or for any other purpose, except to the extent that any such Reporting
Persons actually exercises voting or dispositive power with respect to such securities.
 
Julian C. Baker and Felix J. Baker are also
the sole managers of FBB2 and FBB3 and as such may be deemed to be beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock held by FBB2 and
FBB3 and may be deemed to have the power to vote or direct the vote and dispose or direct the disposition of those shares.
 
Felix J. Baker is a Director of the Issuer.
In connection with his service on the Issuer’s Board, Felix J. Baker holds options to purchase Common Stock of the Issuer
(“Stock Options”), Common Stock and restricted stock units payable solely in Common Stock of the Issuer (“Restricted
Stock”) as disclosed in previous amendments to this Schedule 13D.
 
Felix J. Baker serves on the Issuer’s Board as a representative
of the Funds. The policy of the Funds and the Adviser does not permit employees of the Adviser to receive compensation for serving
as a Director of the Issuer. Therefore, Felix J. Baker has no pecuniary interest in the Stock Options, Common Stock or Restricted
Stock. The Funds are instead entitled to the pecuniary interest in the Stock Options, Common Stock and Restricted Stock.

Common Stock underlying such Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Common Stock held by Felix Baker. The Adviser GP, and Felix J.
Baker and Julian C. Baker as principals of the Adviser GP, may be deemed to have the power to vote or direct the vote of and the
power to dispose or direct the disposition of the Stock Options, Common Stock underlying such Stock Options, Restricted Stock and
Common Stock of the Issuer held by Felix J. Baker.
 
(c) The following transactions in the Issuer’s
Common Stock were effected by the Funds noted below during the sixty days preceding the filing of this statement using working
capital of the applicable purchasing Fund. All purchase transactions were effected in the open market directly with a broker-dealer.

Here's Why the Baker Bros. Are Gobbling up This Emerging Cancer Company
The renowned healthcare investing firm has slowly amassed a huge position in Seattle Genetics. Should investors consider riding on their coattails? 











                George Budwell
            

                (TMFGBudwell)



            
            Sep 5, 2015 at 8:07AM
            
            





The $11.4 billion healthcare specialist investing firm co-managed by Felix and Julian Baker, known as the Baker Bros. Advisors, is regarded as one of the best when it comes to picking stocks in this volatile sector -- and for good reason. The Baker Bros., for instance, have had the rare insight to gobble up shares in former small-cap companies like Acadia Pharmaceuticals, bluebird bio, and Synageva BioPharma Corp. before they ripped higher. So when this fund starts to accumulate shares in a company, investors may want to take heed. 
On that note, the Baker Bros. have slowly been building a massive position in the antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, specialist Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ:SGEN) for a few years now, even adding almost 2 million more shares to their holdings in the second quarter of 2015, according to the quarterly 13Fs filed with the SEC. In total, the firm's holdings in the drugmaker are valued at around $1.5 billion, making it the largest stakeholder in the company. 
Given their significant financial interest in Seattle Genetics, and the fact that Felix Baker sits on its board of directors , I think it's worth the effort to consider if investors should add this stock to their portfolios. So let's take a look at what Seattle Genetics has to offer investors as a mid-cap biotech stock. 
Seattle Genetics is specializing in an emerging field of novel cancer treatmentsBefore immunotherapies stole the headlines and perhaps the show as well, ADCs were believed to be one of the most promising new classes of cancer treatments coming online. After several cases of off-site toxicity cropped up in clinical studies for some experimental ADCs, though, the investing community seemingly forgot about them overnight.
But the pharma industry has not forgotten, not by a long shot. By contrast, several pharma companies have been working vigorously on improving the technology to make it both safer and more effective across a wide variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.  





This work has so far spawned several regulatory approvals for Seattle Genetics' Adcetris for various forms of blood cancer and Roche's Kadcyla for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. 

Source: Seattle Genetics.

Commercially speaking, these two drugs have also been fairly successful as novel oncology treatments. Adcetris' second-quarter sales, for example, grew to $55 million, compared to approximately $44 million for the same period a year ago. And not to be outdone, Kadcyla posted a monstrous 65% sales growth rate in the first half of 2015, relative to the same period a year ago. Perhaps the key takeaway from these figures is that the medical community appears to be deeply interested in employing ADCs in the fight against cancer. 
Is Seattle Genetics a buy?An easy criticism to lob at Seattle Genetics is that it's a smaller biopharma trying to compete against the big boys like Pfizer and Roche, among others. But a deeper look at the company shows that it is a central player in the ADC field, with major licensing agreements with AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Roche, and many others, already in play. In short, big pharma and biotech appear to be rather optimistic about Seattle Genetics' drug development platform moving forward. 
So what investors need to understand is that ADCs are probably not going to be displaced by the suite of checkpoint inhibitors grabbing the headlines right now, evinced in part, by big pharma's major investment in this technology. And the real focus is to refine the ADC platform as a whole.





Turning to the question of whether Seattle Genetics' stock is a buy or not, I think the answer is a "yes." From a fundamental perspective, the drugmaker may not look like a compelling value buy -- largely because of its huge and growing clinical program that is keeping the company's ledger in the red.
But its massive core clinical program, that sports 8 clinical candidates being assessed across a whopping 17 indications, has the potential to generate multiple products with each one capable of raking in hundreds of millions in annual revenue. And then there's Seattle Genetics' wide diversity of research collaborations that also could lead to a substantial upswing in royalty payments.
All told, Seattle Genetics' wide diversity of clinical activities gives it several shots on goal in terms of turning the company into a profitable operation, which is probably one of the main reasons why the Baker Bros. are so keen on this mid-cap biotech stock.
