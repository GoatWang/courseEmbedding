P-Fleet Pricing











Clear pricing without hidden fees.




















 
Don't lose money to unfair fees.
With other fuel card companies, hidden fees and late fees add up. We believe clear pricing keeps customers happy, and happy customers fuel our business. Simply pay for the fuel purchased during the billing period, plus $3 per invoice. No matter how many purchases occur on the account during the billing period, it's only $3, with no additional card fees or transaction fees.

Frequently Asked Questions









How does P-Fleet make money?
We earn a percentage of the pump price from merchants when you use our fuel cards at their fuel locations.


Is there an APR finance fee?
Only if you fail to pay your invoice after 60 days do we charge 1.5% per month. Otherwise, there is no APR charged.


How much is card delivery?
It’s always free by mail. If you need delivery by UPS or FedEx, those charges are billed to your next fuel invoice.












Is there a fee for invoices by mail?
No, but delivery by email or fax will arrive faster so you can review charges in a timely manner.


Are there any contracts?
No contracts. No catches. Cancel anytime.


Is there a fee to re-open my account?
No, we would welcome you back.









 
 


















 
Know what you pay.
The price per gallon depends on the fleet card that you select and the fuel locations that you end up using.
 









Cost-Plus Pricing
Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) is the industry benchmark for cost-plus pricing at commercial fuel sites, including CFN locations.


AAA Pricing
Gas and diesel prices at CFN locations can also be based on the metro averages that AAA reports as an alternative to OPIS-based pricing.


Retail Pricing
Gas and diesel prices at fuel locations within the Voyager or Fleetwide networks are based on the pump prices set by merchants.

Cost-Plus Pricing
Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) is the industry benchmark for cost-plus pricing at commercial fuel sites, including CFN locations.

The price per gallon depends on the fleet card that you select and the fuel locations that you end up using.
 









Cost-Plus Pricing
Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) is the industry benchmark for cost-plus pricing at commercial fuel sites, including CFN locations.


AAA Pricing
Gas and diesel prices at CFN locations can also be based on the metro averages that AAA reports as an alternative to OPIS-based pricing.


Retail Pricing
Gas and diesel prices at fuel locations within the Voyager or Fleetwide networks are based on the pump prices set by merchants.

Reporting











Gain insight into fueling activity and easily account for every dollar spent.




















 
Free fuel reports to simplify tracking of fleet expenses.
Simplify processing and improve administrative efficiency with our fleet fuel reports that deliver the right data to the right personnel.
     


 
 















 
 









Invoices & Statements
Available online and by email, fax or mail. Invoices include Level III data and GL code/department summaries. Master AR statements are available to simplify corporate payments for multiple locations.


Driver & Vehicle Usage
Run reports to compare usage among fleet cards and download transactions into Excel. View gallons, price, transaction amount, date/time, location, fuel type, odometer, among other details.


IFTA Reporting
Free IFTA reporting is available that summarizes fuel card purchases by state and vehicle to reduce the time needed to file IFTA returns.












Fuel Tax Refunds
Identify refundable gallons used in off-road equipment and reefer units to simplify refund filing. We can also apply certain fuel tax exemptions at the time of purchase to eliminate filing for refunds.


Electronic Data Files
Reduce manual data entry with data files that can be imported into your fleet maintenance, asset management or ERP software applications.


Fuel Spend
Summarize fuel spend and employee purchases by region, branch, department, GL code or other cost center of your choice for any time period you need.












E-Receipts
Get notification via email when fleet fuel cards are used. You can also view transactions through your online customer account.


Exception Reporting
Set up reports to detect fraudulent activity and volume changes. Email alerts will be sent should any suspect activity occur with your fleet cards.


Contractor Purchases
If contractors fuel under your account, we can sort fuel card purchases by contractor so you know the amounts to deduct. Or ask about our contractor fuel card program.












On-Site Fueling
We can capture and combine transactional data from fleet fuel cards, on-site tanks and mobile fueling to give you a complete picture of fueling activity.


Fuel Budgeting & Trend Analysis
We have years of historical pricing data to help you analyze trends, evaluate your current purchasing strategy and measure budget goals.
