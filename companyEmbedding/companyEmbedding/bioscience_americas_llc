World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Stem Cell Basics
Bioscience Americas ...Solutions for a Healthier World.


Introduction: What are stem cells, and why are they important?
Digital Image of Stem Cells
Stem cells have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body during early life and growth. In addition, in many tissues they serve as a sort of internal repair system, dividing essentially without limit to replenish other cells as long as the person or animal is still alive. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has the potential either to remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function, such as a muscle cell, a red blood cell, or a brain cell.
Stem cells are distinguished from other cell types by two important characteristics. First, they are unspecialized cells capable of renewing themselves through cell division, sometimes after long periods of inactivity. Second, under certain physiologic or experimental conditions, they can be induced to become tissue- or organ-specific cells with special functions. In some organs, such as the gut and bone marrow, stem cells regularly divide to repair and replace worn out or damaged tissues. In other organs, however, such as the pancreas and the heart, stem cells only divide under special conditions.
Until recently, scientists primarily worked with two kinds of stem cells from animals and humans: embryonic stem cells and non-embryonic “somatic” or “adult” stem cells. Scientists discovered ways to derive embryonic stem cells from early mouse embryos more than 30 years ago. In 1998, a detailed study of the biology of mouse stem cells led to the discovery of a method to derive stem cells from human embryos and grow the cells in the laboratory. These cells are called human embryonic stem cells. In 2006, researchers made another breakthrough by identifying conditions that would allow some specialized adult cells to be “reprogrammed” genetically to assume a stem cell-like state. These new types of stem cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Given their unique regenerative abilities, stem cells offer new potentials for treating diseases such as diabetes, and heart disease.
Research on stem cells continues to advance knowledge about how an organism develops from a single cell and how healthy cells replace damaged cells in adult organisms. Stem cell research is one of the most fascinating areas of contemporary biology





What are the unique properties of all stem cells?
Stem cells differ from other kinds of cells in the body. All stem cells—regardless of their source—have three general properties: they are capable of dividing and renewing themselves for long periods; they are unspecialized; and they can give rise to specialized cell types.
Stem cells are capable of dividing and renewing themselves for long periods. Unlike muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells—which do not normally replicate themselves—stem cells may replicate many times, or proliferate. A starting population of stem cells that proliferates for many months in the laboratory can yield millions of cells. If the resulting cells continue to be unspecialized, like the parent stem cells, the cells are said to be capable of long-term self-renewal.
Stem cells are unspecialized. One of the fundamental properties of a stem cell is that it does not have any tissue-specific structures that allow it to perform specialized functions. For example, a stem cell cannot work with its neighbors to pump blood through the body (like a heart muscle cell), and it cannot carry oxygen molecules through the bloodstream (like a red blood cell). However, unspecialized stem cells can give rise to specialized cells, including heart muscle cells, blood cells, or nerve cells.
Stem cells can give rise to specialized cells. When unspecialized stem cells give rise to specialized cells, the process is called differentiation. While differentiating, the cell usually goes through several stages, becoming more specialized at each step. GIOSTAR has the ability to differentiate stem cells into different organ specific types of cells to repair the damaged organs.
Adult stem cells typically generate the cell types of the tissue in which they reside. For example, a blood-forming adult stem cell in the bone marrow normally gives rise to the many types of blood cells. A blood-forming cell in the bone marrow is called a hematopoietic stem cell. Experiments over the last several years have purported to show that stem cells from one tissue may give rise to cell types of a completely different tissue. GIOSTAR has techniques and abilities to differentiate these cells to different kind of cells to treat the several blood and auto-immune diseases.

GIOSTAR
Bioscience Americas ...Solutions for a Healthier World.The Global Institute of Stem Cell Therapy and Research (GIOSTAR)


GIOSTAR is one of the world’s leading stem cell research institutions. It has been involved in stem cell research work for more than fifteen years. The GIOSTAR team includes international leaders in the field of stem cell research, technologies, health care deliveries and hospital administration.GIOSTAR estimates that more than $400 million has been invested over the years through various grants in developing successful stem cell applications and procedures.
In 2011 GIOSTAR opened its first clinic in Gujarat, India for the treatment of autoimmune diseases including:

Diabetes Type 1 and 2
Lupus
Multiple Sclerosis
Crohn’s Disease
Vasculitis
Scleroderma
Myasthenia Gravis
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s Disease)
Kidney Disease

GIOSTAR has also successfully treated other blood related diseases including sickle cell anemia, lymphoma, and spinal cord injuries and burns.
The Bioscience/GIOSTAR Joint Ventures in South America would encompass these treatment protocols.
The success of the Bioscience/GIOSTAR business model is based on the following:

Backed by more than $400 million in research and development;
Paradigm shift in healthcare strategy and delivery;
Aging population’s need for GIOSTAR services;
$86 billion market in South America alone;
Successful delivery of stem cell treatments since 2011;
More than 4,000 patients treated;
Associated with major medical research universities throughout the world;
World’s leading stem cell research team;
Exceptional Return on Investment projected.

GIOSTAR was formed with the vision to provide stem cell based therapy to people suffering from all kinds of degenerative and genetic diseases. GIOSTAR is the world’s leader in developing innovative stem cell based technology. GIOSTAR’s scientific team is comprised of leading scientists in the area of stem cell biology. GIOSTAR’s primary focus is to discover and develop a cure for human diseases with state of the art and unique stem cell based therapies and products. Regenerative Medicine offers the promise of treatment of diseases previously regarded as incurable.
GIOSTAR’s team includes international leaders in the field of stem cell research and technology. The GIOSTAR team was first in demonstrating the significance of ES cell use for the development of therapies for many types of degenerative tissue and organ degenerative diseases. The publications of these therapies have been thoroughly documented in many peer reviewed and respected journals of medical science.





GIOSTAR’s Scientific and Medical Advisory Board includes an international group of researchers, doctors and scientists in the field of stem cell research, and only those with the highest academic, medical and professional credentials. GIOSTAR has developed and performed clinical protocols of stem cell transplants for leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myelomas, solid tumors (germ cell tumors) and autoimmune diseases (these diseases cause a defective immune system to kill its own cells). The autoimmune diseases include Multiple Sclerosis, Lupus, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and psoriasis. GIOSTAR is a world-wide leader in the use of various types of stem cells, such as mobilized stem cells from blood, bone marrow, CD34-positive and mesenchymal stem cells. These stem cells can be used in the treatment of certain types of immunological and blood related diseases. GIOSTAR has also pioneered research and studies for heart infarct repair, limb ischemia modeling with endometrial regenerative cells, and the generation of universal red cells. GIOSTAR is also the leader for the use of stem cells for transplants for beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.
The GIOSTAR scientific team has also generated the high purity Neural Precursor Cells (NPC) which can be used to treat many neural diseases. GIOSTAR also leads in the field of generating patient specific induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSc) and GIOSTAR has the ability to differentiate these cells to any cell lineage which then can be used as an alternative to adult ES cells.
GIOSTAR is determined to continue to be the world’s leading company working on the development of stem cell based therapy for life threatening diseases and Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), autism, cancer, Crohn’s Disease, heart and blood related diseases, Retinal Degeneration such as glaucoma and macular degeneration, strokes, spinal cord injuries, paralysis, skin burns and trauma, erectile dysfunction, Sickle Cell Anemia, Beta-thalassemia, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). GIOSTAR has also achieved success in treating psoriasis and other skin diseases, arthritis, neuropathy and incontinence.
GIOSTAR is the world-leader in age management technologies and therapeutics (commonly referred to anti-aging) whereby patients utilize proprietary age management services as proactive, preventative stem cell therapies against debilitating diseases associated with our ever increasing aged population. Likewise, age-related macular degeneration, or AMD is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in people over 55 years old and about 30 million people worldwide are affected by the disease. Recent studies indicate that AMD patients will greatly benefit from stem cell therapy. Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, is another set of conditions that stem cell therapy is positioned to conquer.
In collaboration with Bioscience Americas LLC, GIOSTAR’s goal is to establish   clinical therapy and research hospitals/institutes at a number of worldwide locations.   The immediate vision is to be the South American continent’s market leader. GIOSTAR’s expertise will enable quick development of cutting edge science and technology at all locations and will be responsible for the creation of the leading centers for regenerative medicine in the world. The collaborative efforts of Bioscience Capital and GIOSTAR will serve local patients, and will become important medical tourism destinations that attract patients from all over the world for advanced clinical stem cell therapy. Our joint venture is positioned to assist major pharmaceutical players from the U.S.A to meet their need for human clinical trials, and to further develop technology into FDA approved biologics. Our future vision is to build clinics that will be of a SPA nature, developed under the Planetree Model.


 


Our Mission has One Objective – to Provide Solutions for a Healthier World.

Bioscience Americas  Financing
Bioscience Americas, Llc, Limited Liability Company just  submitted form D  for $15.00 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Bioscience Americas, Llc is expected to  fundraise $15.00 million in this  fundraising. The total  financing amount was $15.00 million.  The form was filed on 2015-07-22. The reason for the financing was: unspecified.  The fundraising still has about $15.00 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Bioscience Americas  is based in Arizona. The  company’s business is Biotechnology. The  SEC form was  submitted by Eric Stoffers CEO.  The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 7777 W. Deer Valley Rd., Suite B150, Peoria, Az, Arizona, 85382.

The average  offering amount for companies in the Biotechnology industry is $3.08 million. The offering was 100.00% smaller than the average of $3.08 million.

If you know more about the reasons for the  financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Bioscience Americas  Also
The Form D signed by Eric Stoffers might help Bioscience Americas, Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.

                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Professional Supplement Center has received 4.56 out of 5 stars based on 3 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
