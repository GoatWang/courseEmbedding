Steak 'n Shake is an American casual restaurant chain located primarily in the Midwestern and Southern United States with locations also in the Mid-Atlantic and Western United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Steak 'n Shake Operations, Inc. is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. There are 544 locations, of which 417 are company-operated and 127 are franchised.[2] Typical restaurant locations have sit-down, drive-thru and front-window service, resulting in a hybrid of fast-food to-go service and diner-style sit-down service. Many Steak 'n Shake restaurants are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week. The menu features primarily hamburgers and hand-dipped milkshakes, though other entrees, side items, and drinks are also available. There is no steak on the menu.
The corporation's slogan "Famous for Steakburgers" refers to its most prominent food item, the "Steakburger", so called because it was originally made from a mixture that included T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks.

History[edit]
Gus Belt (born in Morrisonville, Illinois) founded Steak 'n Shake in Normal, Illinois in February 1934, after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps. He converted the combination gas station and chicken restaurant that he owned (Shell's Chicken) into a hamburger stand.[1] The original building at the intersection of Main Street and West Virginia Avenue was damaged by a fire in the early 1960s, but it was repaired and its dining room expanded. In the late 1990s, Steak 'n Shake sold this building to the Monical's Pizza company. Steak 'n Shake's slogan "In Sight It Must Be Right" originally referred to Belt's practice of wheeling a barrel of T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks into the public area of his restaurant, then grinding them into burgers in front of his customers.[1] This practice was intended to reassure customers of the wholesomeness of the product; at that time, ground beef was still viewed with some skepticism by the general public, based on the likelihood of its having deliberate impurities introduced into it. This practice of grinding the beef in public also helped assure his customers of the veracity of Belt's "Steakburger" claim because they could see for themselves that he was grinding steaks into the hamburger meat. Later, patrons were assured that Steakburgers were still made from these ingredients "at our own commissary" for shipment to the restaurants, where the open grill line remains "in sight" to customers.




Cincinnati-style chili "five-way" served over spaghetti at a Steak 'n Shake restaurant


Following the success of the original restaurant, Belt purchased a chain of "Goal Post" restaurants throughout Central Illinois, converting them into Steak 'n Shake restaurants. He also added curb service at this point.[1]
After Gus Belt[edit]
Steak 'n Shake continued to expand throughout Illinois following the death of its creator in 1954, with ownership passing through many hands, including Gus's wife Edith (who ran the chain until 1969); Longchamps, Inc. (an east coast steakhouse company that owned the chain from 1969[3] to 1971[4]); and the Indianapolis-based Franklin Corporation, led by Robert Cronin, author of Selling Steakburgers: The Growth of a Corporate Culture. After the acquisition, Franklin moved Steak 'n Shake's headquarters from Normal, Illinois to Indianapolis.
In 1981, Steak 'n Shake and its parent company Franklin were acquired by E. W. Kelley and Associates,[5] whose chairman, E. W. Ed Kelley was considered largely responsible for the growth of the restaurant until his death on July 4, 2003.[1]

Graham Rahal's 2015 Indianapolis 500 IndyCar was sponsored by Steak 'n Shake


Franchise pricing lawsuits[edit]
Between 2010 and 2015, Steak 'n Shake became involved in lawsuits with several of its franchisees concerning mandatory menu prices and mandatory food sourcing. As of August 2013[update], five lawsuits had been filed. The first lawsuit began in 2010 and is by Stuller, Inc., the Illinois franchisee that is the oldest franchisee in Steak 'n Shake's history. Stuller won a preliminary injunction that went to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2012.[6] Three more franchisees filed suit in April 2013 — Druco Restaurants based in St. Louis, People Sales & Profit Co. based in Georgia, and Scott's S&S Inc. in Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement was reached with these franchisees in 2014, but terms of the settlement were not made public.[8]
Steak 'n Shake filed suit against Denver franchisees Larry and Christopher Baerns in July 2013 over the same issues, with a counterclaim soon after.[9] Steak 'n Shakes won their lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Baerns when judge ruled that the Baerns intentionally overcharged customers.[10] The complaints by the franchisees also question whether Steak 'n Shake promised franchise results that could never actually be achieved under its policies.[11]
Locations[edit]




Opening on Broadway


Today, Steak 'n Shake restaurants are located in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.
The first Steak 'n Shake in the state of Indiana was opened as a drive-in restaurant in Indianapolis in November 1954.[12] As typical for this time period, this restaurant had offered curb service (carhop) in additional to table service and takeout. At the time of the opening of this location, Steak 'n Shake had locations in five states.
The Route 66 Steak 'n Shake at Springfield, Missouri (built 1962) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.[13][14][15]
The company entered North Carolina for the first time by opening a franchised location in Greensboro in December 1996.[16]
After briefly operating a few restaurants in south Texas during the 1970s, Steak 'n Shake returned to Texas by opening locations in the Dallas–Fort Worth area beginning in 2001,[17] in the Houston area beginning in 2012,[18] and in the San Antonio area beginning in 2011.[19]
Steak 'n Shake entered South Carolina for the first time by opening a location in Greenville in February 2001.[20]
The company entered Oklahoma for the first time by opening a franchised location in Edmond, Oklahoma in 2004.[21]
Steak 'n Shake entered West Virginia for the first time by opening a franchised location in Barboursville in August 2007.[22]
Steak 'n Shake opened their first location in Nevada inside the South Point Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 2010[23] and second Nevada location in Reno in July 2013.[24][25]
Steak 'n Shake entered Louisiana for the first time[26] by opening a location near Baton Rouge in Covington, Louisiana in 2011.[27]
The company first entered Colorado via a franchise in Denver in November 2011[28] before the parent took over the Colorado locations after a lengthy lawsuit between the franchisee and the parent company.
In January 2012, they opened their first state of New York location in New York City,[29] adjacent to the Ed Sullivan Theater, then home to the Late Show with David Letterman. Indiana native David Letterman, an avid Steak 'n Shake fan, would frequent the location and mention it often on his show.[30]
The first location in New Jersey was opened by a franchise holder in September 2012 in Paramus, New Jersey.[31]




Opening of first store in Seattle


The first Steak 'n Shake location in the state of Arizona was opened in Tempe in October 2013.[32] [33]
The first and only location in the state of Montana, and in the upper plain states, was opened in Billings in December 2013.[34] This location was forced to close after two and a half years in July 2016 due to poor sales that was blamed on "harsh reviews on social media".[35]
Steak 'n Shake expanded to California in July 2014 by opening a location in Victorville.[36][37] A Los Angeles County location was opened in Santa Monica in late October[38][39] and another in Burbank in December.[40] After a lack of activity for over a year in the highly competitive Californian marketplace, the company announced in April 2016 of the expected opening of their first Orange County location, their fourth in California, in Aliso Viejo in mid-May.[41] After a short delay, a fifth California location was opened behind schedule in Riverside in August 2016.[42]
In 2015, the company had planned to open a restaurant in Northern California in Campbell, California, but local residents have been successful so far in blocking this move.[43] Because of that delay, the first location in Northern California opened instead in Daly City in November 2016[44][45][46] followed by an expected opening in Fresno in early 2017.[47]
In June 2015, the first location in Maryland was opened in Millersville, Maryland.[48]
The Pacific Northwest saw its first location open in Seattle, Washington in May 2016.[49]
International expansion[edit]
In December 2013, Steak 'n Shake opened a corporate office in Monte Carlo, Monaco, to support its expansion in West Asia and Europe.[50]
West Asia[edit]
In October 2012, Steak 'n Shake announced its first international expansion agreement with plans to open forty locations in the United Arab Emirates. The first of these locations opened in Dubai in 2013,[51] but closed in a little more than a year. Ultimately, only two out of the original planned 40 locations were opened in the United Arab Emirates with both being closed in January 2015.[52]
The brand also announced in December 2013 a 50-unit franchise agreement in Saudi Arabia with AB Holdings. The first location in Riyadh was expected to open in the first half of 2014.[53]
The first location in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait was opened in December 2014.[54]
Europe[edit]
The first two European locations were opened in Cannes in France in May 2014[55][56] and on the island of Ibiza in Spain in June 2014.[57]
The second location in France was opened in Marseille in December 2014.[58] A third location in France was opened in Toulon in April 2016[59] and was quickly followed in June by the openings of a fourth and fifth locations in Caen and Rueil-Malmaison,[60] in October by the openings of a sixth location at the Cité Europe shopping centre in Coquelles,[61] and in November of a seventh location in Fenouillet.[62]
The second location in Spain was opened in the capital Madrid in September 2015[63] followed by a third location in Churra, Murcia in October 2015.[64]
The first location in Italy was opened in Milan in December 2015.[65] A second location was opened in Peschiera del Garda in May 2016.[66] A third location was opened in Castione Andevenno in September 2016.[67]
In July 2016, the first location in Portugal was opened in Montijo, near Lisbon.[68]
In December 2016, the first store in the United Kingdom was opened in Chester, Cheshire, England.[69]

Steak 'n Shake is an American casual restaurant chain located primarily in the Midwestern and Southern United States with locations also in the Mid-Atlantic and Western United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Steak 'n Shake Operations, Inc. is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. There are 544 locations, of which 417 are company-operated and 127 are franchised.[2] Typical restaurant locations have sit-down, drive-thru and front-window service, resulting in a hybrid of fast-food to-go service and diner-style sit-down service. Many Steak 'n Shake restaurants are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week. The menu features primarily hamburgers and hand-dipped milkshakes, though other entrees, side items, and drinks are also available. There is no steak on the menu.
The corporation's slogan "Famous for Steakburgers" refers to its most prominent food item, the "Steakburger", so called because it was originally made from a mixture that included T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks.

History[edit]
Gus Belt (born in Morrisonville, Illinois) founded Steak 'n Shake in Normal, Illinois in February 1934, after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps. He converted the combination gas station and chicken restaurant that he owned (Shell's Chicken) into a hamburger stand.[1] The original building at the intersection of Main Street and West Virginia Avenue was damaged by a fire in the early 1960s, but it was repaired and its dining room expanded. In the late 1990s, Steak 'n Shake sold this building to the Monical's Pizza company. Steak 'n Shake's slogan "In Sight It Must Be Right" originally referred to Belt's practice of wheeling a barrel of T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks into the public area of his restaurant, then grinding them into burgers in front of his customers.[1] This practice was intended to reassure customers of the wholesomeness of the product; at that time, ground beef was still viewed with some skepticism by the general public, based on the likelihood of its having deliberate impurities introduced into it. This practice of grinding the beef in public also helped assure his customers of the veracity of Belt's "Steakburger" claim because they could see for themselves that he was grinding steaks into the hamburger meat. Later, patrons were assured that Steakburgers were still made from these ingredients "at our own commissary" for shipment to the restaurants, where the open grill line remains "in sight" to customers.

Following the success of the original restaurant, Belt purchased a chain of "Goal Post" restaurants throughout Central Illinois, converting them into Steak 'n Shake restaurants. He also added curb service at this point.[1]
After Gus Belt[edit]
Steak 'n Shake continued to expand throughout Illinois following the death of its creator in 1954, with ownership passing through many hands, including Gus's wife Edith (who ran the chain until 1969); Longchamps, Inc. (an east coast steakhouse company that owned the chain from 1969[3] to 1971[4]); and the Indianapolis-based Franklin Corporation, led by Robert Cronin, author of Selling Steakburgers: The Growth of a Corporate Culture. After the acquisition, Franklin moved Steak 'n Shake's headquarters from Normal, Illinois to Indianapolis.
In 1981, Steak 'n Shake and its parent company Franklin were acquired by E. W. Kelley and Associates,[5] whose chairman, E. W. Ed Kelley was considered largely responsible for the growth of the restaurant until his death on July 4, 2003.[1]

Franchise pricing lawsuits[edit]
Between 2010 and 2015, Steak 'n Shake became involved in lawsuits with several of its franchisees concerning mandatory menu prices and mandatory food sourcing. As of August 2013[update], five lawsuits had been filed. The first lawsuit began in 2010 and is by Stuller, Inc., the Illinois franchisee that is the oldest franchisee in Steak 'n Shake's history. Stuller won a preliminary injunction that went to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2012.[6] Three more franchisees filed suit in April 2013 — Druco Restaurants based in St. Louis, People Sales & Profit Co. based in Georgia, and Scott's S&S Inc. in Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement was reached with these franchisees in 2014, but terms of the settlement were not made public.[8]
Steak 'n Shake filed suit against Denver franchisees Larry and Christopher Baerns in July 2013 over the same issues, with a counterclaim soon after.[9] Steak 'n Shakes won their lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Baerns when judge ruled that the Baerns intentionally overcharged customers.[10] The complaints by the franchisees also question whether Steak 'n Shake promised franchise results that could never actually be achieved under its policies.[11]
Locations[edit]




Opening on Broadway


Today, Steak 'n Shake restaurants are located in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.
The first Steak 'n Shake in the state of Indiana was opened as a drive-in restaurant in Indianapolis in November 1954.[12] As typical for this time period, this restaurant had offered curb service (carhop) in additional to table service and takeout. At the time of the opening of this location, Steak 'n Shake had locations in five states.
The Route 66 Steak 'n Shake at Springfield, Missouri (built 1962) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.[13][14][15]
The company entered North Carolina for the first time by opening a franchised location in Greensboro in December 1996.[16]
After briefly operating a few restaurants in south Texas during the 1970s, Steak 'n Shake returned to Texas by opening locations in the Dallas–Fort Worth area beginning in 2001,[17] in the Houston area beginning in 2012,[18] and in the San Antonio area beginning in 2011.[19]
Steak 'n Shake entered South Carolina for the first time by opening a location in Greenville in February 2001.[20]
The company entered Oklahoma for the first time by opening a franchised location in Edmond, Oklahoma in 2004.[21]
Steak 'n Shake entered West Virginia for the first time by opening a franchised location in Barboursville in August 2007.[22]
Steak 'n Shake opened their first location in Nevada inside the South Point Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 2010[23] and second Nevada location in Reno in July 2013.[24][25]
Steak 'n Shake entered Louisiana for the first time[26] by opening a location near Baton Rouge in Covington, Louisiana in 2011.[27]
The company first entered Colorado via a franchise in Denver in November 2011[28] before the parent took over the Colorado locations after a lengthy lawsuit between the franchisee and the parent company.
In January 2012, they opened their first state of New York location in New York City,[29] adjacent to the Ed Sullivan Theater, then home to the Late Show with David Letterman. Indiana native David Letterman, an avid Steak 'n Shake fan, would frequent the location and mention it often on his show.[30]
The first location in New Jersey was opened by a franchise holder in September 2012 in Paramus, New Jersey.[31]




Opening of first store in Seattle


The first Steak 'n Shake location in the state of Arizona was opened in Tempe in October 2013.[32] [33]
The first and only location in the state of Montana, and in the upper plain states, was opened in Billings in December 2013.[34] This location was forced to close after two and a half years in July 2016 due to poor sales that was blamed on "harsh reviews on social media".[35]
Steak 'n Shake expanded to California in July 2014 by opening a location in Victorville.[36][37] A Los Angeles County location was opened in Santa Monica in late October[38][39] and another in Burbank in December.[40] After a lack of activity for over a year in the highly competitive Californian marketplace, the company announced in April 2016 of the expected opening of their first Orange County location, their fourth in California, in Aliso Viejo in mid-May.[41] After a short delay, a fifth California location was opened behind schedule in Riverside in August 2016.[42]
In 2015, the company had planned to open a restaurant in Northern California in Campbell, California, but local residents have been successful so far in blocking this move.[43] Because of that delay, the first location in Northern California opened instead in Daly City in November 2016[44][45][46] followed by an expected opening in Fresno in early 2017.[47]
In June 2015, the first location in Maryland was opened in Millersville, Maryland.[48]
The Pacific Northwest saw its first location open in Seattle, Washington in May 2016.[49]
International expansion[edit]
In December 2013, Steak 'n Shake opened a corporate office in Monte Carlo, Monaco, to support its expansion in West Asia and Europe.[50]
West Asia[edit]
In October 2012, Steak 'n Shake announced its first international expansion agreement with plans to open forty locations in the United Arab Emirates. The first of these locations opened in Dubai in 2013,[51] but closed in a little more than a year. Ultimately, only two out of the original planned 40 locations were opened in the United Arab Emirates with both being closed in January 2015.[52]
The brand also announced in December 2013 a 50-unit franchise agreement in Saudi Arabia with AB Holdings. The first location in Riyadh was expected to open in the first half of 2014.[53]
The first location in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait was opened in December 2014.[54]
Europe[edit]
The first two European locations were opened in Cannes in France in May 2014[55][56] and on the island of Ibiza in Spain in June 2014.[57]
The second location in France was opened in Marseille in December 2014.[58] A third location in France was opened in Toulon in April 2016[59] and was quickly followed in June by the openings of a fourth and fifth locations in Caen and Rueil-Malmaison,[60] in October by the openings of a sixth location at the Cité Europe shopping centre in Coquelles,[61] and in November of a seventh location in Fenouillet.[62]
The second location in Spain was opened in the capital Madrid in September 2015[63] followed by a third location in Churra, Murcia in October 2015.[64]
The first location in Italy was opened in Milan in December 2015.[65] A second location was opened in Peschiera del Garda in May 2016.[66] A third location was opened in Castione Andevenno in September 2016.[67]
In July 2016, the first location in Portugal was opened in Montijo, near Lisbon.[68]
In December 2016, the first store in the United Kingdom was opened in Chester, Cheshire, England.[69]

Steak 'n Shake is an American casual restaurant chain located primarily in the Midwestern and Southern United States with locations also in the Mid-Atlantic and Western United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Steak 'n Shake Operations, Inc. is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. There are 544 locations, of which 417 are company-operated and 127 are franchised.[2] Typical restaurant locations have sit-down, drive-thru and front-window service, resulting in a hybrid of fast-food to-go service and diner-style sit-down service. Many Steak 'n Shake restaurants are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week. The menu features primarily hamburgers and hand-dipped milkshakes, though other entrees, side items, and drinks are also available. There is no steak on the menu.
The corporation's slogan "Famous for Steakburgers" refers to its most prominent food item, the "Steakburger", so called because it was originally made from a mixture that included T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks.

History[edit]
Gus Belt (born in Morrisonville, Illinois) founded Steak 'n Shake in Normal, Illinois in February 1934, after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps. He converted the combination gas station and chicken restaurant that he owned (Shell's Chicken) into a hamburger stand.[1] The original building at the intersection of Main Street and West Virginia Avenue was damaged by a fire in the early 1960s, but it was repaired and its dining room expanded. In the late 1990s, Steak 'n Shake sold this building to the Monical's Pizza company. Steak 'n Shake's slogan "In Sight It Must Be Right" originally referred to Belt's practice of wheeling a barrel of T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks into the public area of his restaurant, then grinding them into burgers in front of his customers.[1] This practice was intended to reassure customers of the wholesomeness of the product; at that time, ground beef was still viewed with some skepticism by the general public, based on the likelihood of its having deliberate impurities introduced into it. This practice of grinding the beef in public also helped assure his customers of the veracity of Belt's "Steakburger" claim because they could see for themselves that he was grinding steaks into the hamburger meat. Later, patrons were assured that Steakburgers were still made from these ingredients "at our own commissary" for shipment to the restaurants, where the open grill line remains "in sight" to customers.

Following the success of the original restaurant, Belt purchased a chain of "Goal Post" restaurants throughout Central Illinois, converting them into Steak 'n Shake restaurants. He also added curb service at this point.[1]
After Gus Belt[edit]
Steak 'n Shake continued to expand throughout Illinois following the death of its creator in 1954, with ownership passing through many hands, including Gus's wife Edith (who ran the chain until 1969); Longchamps, Inc. (an east coast steakhouse company that owned the chain from 1969[3] to 1971[4]); and the Indianapolis-based Franklin Corporation, led by Robert Cronin, author of Selling Steakburgers: The Growth of a Corporate Culture. After the acquisition, Franklin moved Steak 'n Shake's headquarters from Normal, Illinois to Indianapolis.
In 1981, Steak 'n Shake and its parent company Franklin were acquired by E. W. Kelley and Associates,[5] whose chairman, E. W. Ed Kelley was considered largely responsible for the growth of the restaurant until his death on July 4, 2003.[1]

Franchise pricing lawsuits[edit]
Between 2010 and 2015, Steak 'n Shake became involved in lawsuits with several of its franchisees concerning mandatory menu prices and mandatory food sourcing. As of August 2013[update], five lawsuits had been filed. The first lawsuit began in 2010 and is by Stuller, Inc., the Illinois franchisee that is the oldest franchisee in Steak 'n Shake's history. Stuller won a preliminary injunction that went to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2012.[6] Three more franchisees filed suit in April 2013 — Druco Restaurants based in St. Louis, People Sales & Profit Co. based in Georgia, and Scott's S&S Inc. in Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement was reached with these franchisees in 2014, but terms of the settlement were not made public.[8]
Steak 'n Shake filed suit against Denver franchisees Larry and Christopher Baerns in July 2013 over the same issues, with a counterclaim soon after.[9] Steak 'n Shakes won their lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Baerns when judge ruled that the Baerns intentionally overcharged customers.[10] The complaints by the franchisees also question whether Steak 'n Shake promised franchise results that could never actually be achieved under its policies.[11]
Locations[edit]




Opening on Broadway


Today, Steak 'n Shake restaurants are located in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.
The first Steak 'n Shake in the state of Indiana was opened as a drive-in restaurant in Indianapolis in November 1954.[12] As typical for this time period, this restaurant had offered curb service (carhop) in additional to table service and takeout. At the time of the opening of this location, Steak 'n Shake had locations in five states.
The Route 66 Steak 'n Shake at Springfield, Missouri (built 1962) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.[13][14][15]
The company entered North Carolina for the first time by opening a franchised location in Greensboro in December 1996.[16]
After briefly operating a few restaurants in south Texas during the 1970s, Steak 'n Shake returned to Texas by opening locations in the Dallas–Fort Worth area beginning in 2001,[17] in the Houston area beginning in 2012,[18] and in the San Antonio area beginning in 2011.[19]
Steak 'n Shake entered South Carolina for the first time by opening a location in Greenville in February 2001.[20]
The company entered Oklahoma for the first time by opening a franchised location in Edmond, Oklahoma in 2004.[21]
Steak 'n Shake entered West Virginia for the first time by opening a franchised location in Barboursville in August 2007.[22]
Steak 'n Shake opened their first location in Nevada inside the South Point Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 2010[23] and second Nevada location in Reno in July 2013.[24][25]
Steak 'n Shake entered Louisiana for the first time[26] by opening a location near Baton Rouge in Covington, Louisiana in 2011.[27]
The company first entered Colorado via a franchise in Denver in November 2011[28] before the parent took over the Colorado locations after a lengthy lawsuit between the franchisee and the parent company.
In January 2012, they opened their first state of New York location in New York City,[29] adjacent to the Ed Sullivan Theater, then home to the Late Show with David Letterman. Indiana native David Letterman, an avid Steak 'n Shake fan, would frequent the location and mention it often on his show.[30]
The first location in New Jersey was opened by a franchise holder in September 2012 in Paramus, New Jersey.[31]




Opening of first store in Seattle


The first Steak 'n Shake location in the state of Arizona was opened in Tempe in October 2013.[32] [33]
The first and only location in the state of Montana, and in the upper plain states, was opened in Billings in December 2013.[34] This location was forced to close after two and a half years in July 2016 due to poor sales that was blamed on "harsh reviews on social media".[35]
Steak 'n Shake expanded to California in July 2014 by opening a location in Victorville.[36][37] A Los Angeles County location was opened in Santa Monica in late October[38][39] and another in Burbank in December.[40] After a lack of activity for over a year in the highly competitive Californian marketplace, the company announced in April 2016 of the expected opening of their first Orange County location, their fourth in California, in Aliso Viejo in mid-May.[41] After a short delay, a fifth California location was opened behind schedule in Riverside in August 2016.[42]
In 2015, the company had planned to open a restaurant in Northern California in Campbell, California, but local residents have been successful so far in blocking this move.[43] Because of that delay, the first location in Northern California opened instead in Daly City in November 2016[44][45][46] followed by an expected opening in Fresno in early 2017.[47]
In June 2015, the first location in Maryland was opened in Millersville, Maryland.[48]
The Pacific Northwest saw its first location open in Seattle, Washington in May 2016.[49]
International expansion[edit]
In December 2013, Steak 'n Shake opened a corporate office in Monte Carlo, Monaco, to support its expansion in West Asia and Europe.[50]
West Asia[edit]
In October 2012, Steak 'n Shake announced its first international expansion agreement with plans to open forty locations in the United Arab Emirates. The first of these locations opened in Dubai in 2013,[51] but closed in a little more than a year. Ultimately, only two out of the original planned 40 locations were opened in the United Arab Emirates with both being closed in January 2015.[52]
The brand also announced in December 2013 a 50-unit franchise agreement in Saudi Arabia with AB Holdings. The first location in Riyadh was expected to open in the first half of 2014.[53]
The first location in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait was opened in December 2014.[54]
Europe[edit]
The first two European locations were opened in Cannes in France in May 2014[55][56] and on the island of Ibiza in Spain in June 2014.[57]
The second location in France was opened in Marseille in December 2014.[58] A third location in France was opened in Toulon in April 2016[59] and was quickly followed in June by the openings of a fourth and fifth locations in Caen and Rueil-Malmaison,[60] in October by the openings of a sixth location at the Cité Europe shopping centre in Coquelles,[61] and in November of a seventh location in Fenouillet.[62]
The second location in Spain was opened in the capital Madrid in September 2015[63] followed by a third location in Churra, Murcia in October 2015.[64]
The first location in Italy was opened in Milan in December 2015.[65] A second location was opened in Peschiera del Garda in May 2016.[66] A third location was opened in Castione Andevenno in September 2016.[67]
In July 2016, the first location in Portugal was opened in Montijo, near Lisbon.[68]
In December 2016, the first store in the United Kingdom was opened in Chester, Cheshire, England.[69]

Steak 'n Shake is an American casual restaurant chain located primarily in the Midwestern and Southern United States with locations also in the Mid-Atlantic and Western United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Steak 'n Shake Operations, Inc. is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. There are 544 locations, of which 417 are company-operated and 127 are franchised.[2] Typical restaurant locations have sit-down, drive-thru and front-window service, resulting in a hybrid of fast-food to-go service and diner-style sit-down service. Many Steak 'n Shake restaurants are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week. The menu features primarily hamburgers and hand-dipped milkshakes, though other entrees, side items, and drinks are also available. There is no steak on the menu.
The corporation's slogan "Famous for Steakburgers" refers to its most prominent food item, the "Steakburger", so called because it was originally made from a mixture that included T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks.

History[edit]
Gus Belt (born in Morrisonville, Illinois) founded Steak 'n Shake in Normal, Illinois in February 1934, after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps. He converted the combination gas station and chicken restaurant that he owned (Shell's Chicken) into a hamburger stand.[1] The original building at the intersection of Main Street and West Virginia Avenue was damaged by a fire in the early 1960s, but it was repaired and its dining room expanded. In the late 1990s, Steak 'n Shake sold this building to the Monical's Pizza company. Steak 'n Shake's slogan "In Sight It Must Be Right" originally referred to Belt's practice of wheeling a barrel of T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks into the public area of his restaurant, then grinding them into burgers in front of his customers.[1] This practice was intended to reassure customers of the wholesomeness of the product; at that time, ground beef was still viewed with some skepticism by the general public, based on the likelihood of its having deliberate impurities introduced into it. This practice of grinding the beef in public also helped assure his customers of the veracity of Belt's "Steakburger" claim because they could see for themselves that he was grinding steaks into the hamburger meat. Later, patrons were assured that Steakburgers were still made from these ingredients "at our own commissary" for shipment to the restaurants, where the open grill line remains "in sight" to customers.

Following the success of the original restaurant, Belt purchased a chain of "Goal Post" restaurants throughout Central Illinois, converting them into Steak 'n Shake restaurants. He also added curb service at this point.[1]
After Gus Belt[edit]
Steak 'n Shake continued to expand throughout Illinois following the death of its creator in 1954, with ownership passing through many hands, including Gus's wife Edith (who ran the chain until 1969); Longchamps, Inc. (an east coast steakhouse company that owned the chain from 1969[3] to 1971[4]); and the Indianapolis-based Franklin Corporation, led by Robert Cronin, author of Selling Steakburgers: The Growth of a Corporate Culture. After the acquisition, Franklin moved Steak 'n Shake's headquarters from Normal, Illinois to Indianapolis.
In 1981, Steak 'n Shake and its parent company Franklin were acquired by E. W. Kelley and Associates,[5] whose chairman, E. W. Ed Kelley was considered largely responsible for the growth of the restaurant until his death on July 4, 2003.[1]

Franchise pricing lawsuits[edit]
Between 2010 and 2015, Steak 'n Shake became involved in lawsuits with several of its franchisees concerning mandatory menu prices and mandatory food sourcing. As of August 2013[update], five lawsuits had been filed. The first lawsuit began in 2010 and is by Stuller, Inc., the Illinois franchisee that is the oldest franchisee in Steak 'n Shake's history. Stuller won a preliminary injunction that went to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2012.[6] Three more franchisees filed suit in April 2013 — Druco Restaurants based in St. Louis, People Sales & Profit Co. based in Georgia, and Scott's S&S Inc. in Pennsylvania.[7] A settlement was reached with these franchisees in 2014, but terms of the settlement were not made public.[8]
Steak 'n Shake filed suit against Denver franchisees Larry and Christopher Baerns in July 2013 over the same issues, with a counterclaim soon after.[9] Steak 'n Shakes won their lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Baerns when judge ruled that the Baerns intentionally overcharged customers.[10] The complaints by the franchisees also question whether Steak 'n Shake promised franchise results that could never actually be achieved under its policies.[11]
Locations[edit]




Opening on Broadway


Today, Steak 'n Shake restaurants are located in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.
The first Steak 'n Shake in the state of Indiana was opened as a drive-in restaurant in Indianapolis in November 1954.[12] As typical for this time period, this restaurant had offered curb service (carhop) in additional to table service and takeout. At the time of the opening of this location, Steak 'n Shake had locations in five states.
The Route 66 Steak 'n Shake at Springfield, Missouri (built 1962) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.[13][14][15]
The company entered North Carolina for the first time by opening a franchised location in Greensboro in December 1996.[16]
After briefly operating a few restaurants in south Texas during the 1970s, Steak 'n Shake returned to Texas by opening locations in the Dallas–Fort Worth area beginning in 2001,[17] in the Houston area beginning in 2012,[18] and in the San Antonio area beginning in 2011.[19]
Steak 'n Shake entered South Carolina for the first time by opening a location in Greenville in February 2001.[20]
The company entered Oklahoma for the first time by opening a franchised location in Edmond, Oklahoma in 2004.[21]
Steak 'n Shake entered West Virginia for the first time by opening a franchised location in Barboursville in August 2007.[22]
Steak 'n Shake opened their first location in Nevada inside the South Point Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 2010[23] and second Nevada location in Reno in July 2013.[24][25]
Steak 'n Shake entered Louisiana for the first time[26] by opening a location near Baton Rouge in Covington, Louisiana in 2011.[27]
The company first entered Colorado via a franchise in Denver in November 2011[28] before the parent took over the Colorado locations after a lengthy lawsuit between the franchisee and the parent company.
In January 2012, they opened their first state of New York location in New York City,[29] adjacent to the Ed Sullivan Theater, then home to the Late Show with David Letterman. Indiana native David Letterman, an avid Steak 'n Shake fan, would frequent the location and mention it often on his show.[30]
The first location in New Jersey was opened by a franchise holder in September 2012 in Paramus, New Jersey.[31]




Opening of first store in Seattle


The first Steak 'n Shake location in the state of Arizona was opened in Tempe in October 2013.[32] [33]
The first and only location in the state of Montana, and in the upper plain states, was opened in Billings in December 2013.[34] This location was forced to close after two and a half years in July 2016 due to poor sales that was blamed on "harsh reviews on social media".[35]
Steak 'n Shake expanded to California in July 2014 by opening a location in Victorville.[36][37] A Los Angeles County location was opened in Santa Monica in late October[38][39] and another in Burbank in December.[40] After a lack of activity for over a year in the highly competitive Californian marketplace, the company announced in April 2016 of the expected opening of their first Orange County location, their fourth in California, in Aliso Viejo in mid-May.[41] After a short delay, a fifth California location was opened behind schedule in Riverside in August 2016.[42]
In 2015, the company had planned to open a restaurant in Northern California in Campbell, California, but local residents have been successful so far in blocking this move.[43] Because of that delay, the first location in Northern California opened instead in Daly City in November 2016[44][45][46] followed by an expected opening in Fresno in early 2017.[47]
In June 2015, the first location in Maryland was opened in Millersville, Maryland.[48]
The Pacific Northwest saw its first location open in Seattle, Washington in May 2016.[49]
International expansion[edit]
In December 2013, Steak 'n Shake opened a corporate office in Monte Carlo, Monaco, to support its expansion in West Asia and Europe.[50]
West Asia[edit]
In October 2012, Steak 'n Shake announced its first international expansion agreement with plans to open forty locations in the United Arab Emirates. The first of these locations opened in Dubai in 2013,[51] but closed in a little more than a year. Ultimately, only two out of the original planned 40 locations were opened in the United Arab Emirates with both being closed in January 2015.[52]
The brand also announced in December 2013 a 50-unit franchise agreement in Saudi Arabia with AB Holdings. The first location in Riyadh was expected to open in the first half of 2014.[53]
The first location in the Persian Gulf country of Kuwait was opened in December 2014.[54]
Europe[edit]
The first two European locations were opened in Cannes in France in May 2014[55][56] and on the island of Ibiza in Spain in June 2014.[57]
The second location in France was opened in Marseille in December 2014.[58] A third location in France was opened in Toulon in April 2016[59] and was quickly followed in June by the openings of a fourth and fifth locations in Caen and Rueil-Malmaison,[60] in October by the openings of a sixth location at the Cité Europe shopping centre in Coquelles,[61] and in November of a seventh location in Fenouillet.[62]
The second location in Spain was opened in the capital Madrid in September 2015[63] followed by a third location in Churra, Murcia in October 2015.[64]
The first location in Italy was opened in Milan in December 2015.[65] A second location was opened in Peschiera del Garda in May 2016.[66] A third location was opened in Castione Andevenno in September 2016.[67]
In July 2016, the first location in Portugal was opened in Montijo, near Lisbon.[68]
In December 2016, the first store in the United Kingdom was opened in Chester, Cheshire, England.[69]

Activist investor Sardar Biglari, who’s made a career out of zinging executives at underperforming public companies, is about to get a taste of his own medicine.

	Groveland Capital LLC, a Minneapolis-based investment firm, has filed notice with regulators that it will seek to replace Biglari and Biglari Holdings Inc.’s other five directors with its own slate of nominees at the company’s annual meeting in April.

	The move comes at a vulnerable time for Sardar Biglari, who seized control of Indianapolis-based Steak n Shake in 2008 after publicly bashing management, even going so far as to rent billboards along Interstate 465.

	Shares of San Antonio-based Biglari Holdings Inc. slumped 21 percent last year—in part because of a controversial offering that allowed existing shareholders to buy more stock on the cheap. Meanwhile, Biglari Holdings faces a raft of lawsuits from franchisees accusing the company of unlawfully mandating menu prices and from investors angry over governance practices.

	Executives at Groveland, which owns only about 3,000 Biglari Holdings shares, aren’t saying what led them to turn activist. A Groveland representative did not respond to IBJ’s inquiries but told the San Antonio Express-News that because of Securities and Exchange Commission rules it would have no comment until filing a proxy statement, perhaps in February.

	Investors who buy shares in Biglari Holdings—which also owns the Maxim men’s magazine, an insurance company, Western Sizzlin and a big stake in Cracker Barrel—always have known they were placing a bet with a supremely confident, unconventional entrepreneur.

 Biglari

	Sardar Biglari, a 37-year-old Iranian-American, makes no apologies for running his company like a fiefdom. As he wrote last month in his annual letter to shareholders, “Capital allocation responsibility is managed exclusively by myself rather than through a committee. We do not employ analysts or advisors. A bureaucracy suffocates decision-making acuity and agility.”

	But even some investors comfortable with giving Biglari wide latitude balked after he rolled out a super-sized hedge-fund-style compensation package for himself, and when he proposed various maneuvers that expanded his control over company stock.

	Several investor lawsuits take aim at a 2013 deal under which he licensed the “Biglari” name to the company for 20 years. Biglari won’t receive royalties if he remains atop the company, but if it were sold, or if he were forced out for anything but malfeasance, he’d receive 2.5 percent of sales for five years—a sum that could surpass $100 million.

	The licensing agreement “is nothing more than a thinly hidden way for defendant Biglari to further entrench himself. … There was no apparent business purpose in naming the company after Biglari in the first place, other than to aggrandize defendant Biglari,” a 2013 lawsuit says.

	Groveland said in a notice filed with the SEC that its slate will include that firm’s founder and CEO, Nicholas Swenson, as well as Ryan Buckley, a director at the investment banking firm Livingstone Partners, and Jim Stryker, a 37-year restaurant industry veteran who formerly was chief financial officer of the Tennessee-based parent of the Perkins and Marie Callender’s chains.

	As a matter of policy, Biglari doesn’t grant interviews to journalists, and he did not respond to a voice mail message left at his San Antonio office.

	Plenty of franchisees may get a perverse pleasure out of watching Biglari squirm a bit, given their animosity over his unilateral 2010 ban on franchisees setting their own prices. The move coincided with the chain’s push to ramp up customer counts by offering $4 meals and other bargain pricing.

	Franchisees, who have filed at least four lawsuits asserting the ban is unlawful, say it has put them in a financial vise as food prices rose. A band of franchisees has tried to reach an amicable resolution, but to no avail.

	“In the end, Steak n Shake made the decision to bully, rather than bargain, and made it clear that it would terminate any franchisee that refused to adopt the policy,” according to the latest suit, filed this month by Mobile, Alabama-based Eastern Shore Restaurants Inc.

	Biglari made no mention of the legal morass in last month’s letter to shareholders, which struck an upbeat tone, albeit one that seemed slightly less cocksure than past letters.

	He characterized the performance of Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin in the latest fiscal year merely as “satisfactory” and he offered no guarantee he would succeed in reviving Maxim, which has rung up $16 million in operating losses since he bought it in February.

	Biglari hopes to turn things around by improving the magazine itself and by licensing the Maxim name to a range of consumer products and services.

	“We risk being quite wrong,” he wrote in the letter. “Nevertheless, our duty is not to avoid discomfiture but to take action after judging we have a mathematical edge. Anyone desiring a 100% probability of success best take Clint Eastwood’s advice in the film ‘The Rookie,’ ‘If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.’”

Money to be made?

	One reason Groveland’s Swenson might be swooping in is that he views Biglari Holdings as woefully undervalued.

	One camp of investors, using a sum-of-its-parts analysis, wholeheartedly agrees.

	Consider this: Biglari Holdings bought its 20-percent stake in Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. from May 2011 to December 2012 for $241 million. Along the way, Biglari Holdings has scooped up $35 million in Cracker Barrel dividends, and the value of its stake has swelled to $639 million.

	Biglari Holdings overall has a market capitalization of $831 million, just $192 million more than the Cracker Barrel stake. Some investors say that modest number suggests the market is vastly underappreciating the value of Biglari Holdings’ wholly owned businesses, especially Steak n Shake—which posted more than $26 million in operating earnings in the latest fiscal year.

	Despite all the franchisee unrest, Biglari has concrete successes he can point to at Steak n Shake. Before he took the helm, the chain weathered 13 consecutive quarters of declining same-store sales. It now is on a run of 23 straight quarters of increasing same-store sales.

	In his letter, Biglari wrote that relentless cost-cutting has allowed the chain to hold the line on prices for core menu items, even though beef costs alone were $19 million higher in the latest fiscal year than in 2009.

	“Our pricing philosophy is not to maximize profit per customer but to offer products at the lowest possible prices to an ever-increasing number of customers,” he wrote.•
