Early life and education[edit]
Ralph de la Vega was born in Cuba, and emigrated to the United States in 1962, at the age of ten. In an effort to flee the Castro dictatorship in that country, his family attempted to board a plane to Miami; however the border official stated that only Ralph’s papers were in order. He was sent to the US alone, where he stayed with the friend of an aunt. It took four years for his parents to join him.[3] Once his parents arrived, de la Vega took an after-school job sweeping the floors of a garment factory to help support the family. He was then promoted, and started making money selling the clothing made by the company.[4]
De la Vega eventually enrolled in a pre-engineering curriculum at Miami Dade College, and worked part-time as a draftsman at an engineering firm.[4] He then received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Florida Atlantic University. He later received an MBA from Northern Illinois University.[5][6] He also completed the Executive Program at the University of Virginia and received an honorary doctorate from Florida Atlantic.[7]
BellSouth[edit]
De la Vega started his career in 1974 with BellSouth (then Southern Bell) as a management assistant.[8] Over the years he held positions in Network Planning, Consumer Services, Engineering, and DSL and Operations.[5] In 1985 he became a director at the Bell's Communications Research Technical Education Center (Bellcore TEC).[4] He was later made responsible for all BellSouth Telecommunications Network Operations in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.[5] Afterwards he became the president of BellSouth Broadband Internet Services.[5][9] De la Vega eventually became the president of BellSouth Latin America, a role he held from 2002 to 2003.[10] In this job he was in charge of the wireless subsidiaries in eleven countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The CEOs of each company reported to de la Vega, who restructured the decision-making infrastructure of the group in order to create cooperative strategies and policies between the different firms. At the end of his first year as president, BellSouth Latin America turned a profit for the first time.[11]
AT&T[edit]
De la Vega served as the chief operating officer of Cingular Wireless,[12] starting in 2004.[10] In 2007 Cingular was acquired by SBC (itself later re-named AT&T),[13] and he was named CEO of AT&T Mobility.[14] De la Vega was one of the leaders of the merger.[3] At AT&T de la Vega formed relationships between the company’s mobile unit and automobile manufacturers, including General Motors, in order to grow the company’s market for car connectivity. He also pushed for promotions intended to draw subscribers away from AT&T’s competitors.[14] He also brought the iPhone to the company.[15] De la Vega was the CEO of AT&T Mobility until 2014, when he was promoted to President and CEO of AT&T’s combined Mobile & Business Solutions group.[13] One of the main goals of de la Vega in this position is to develop AT&T’s role in the Internet of Things and to deliver integrated services to business customers.[16] In 2016 he became the Vice Chairman of AT&T Inc. and CEO of AT&T Business Solutions and AT&T International.[17][18] Ralph De la Vega retired from this position on 31 December 2016.
Obstacles Welcome[edit]
In 2009 de la Vega coauthored the book Obstacles Welcome: How to Turn Adversity to Advantage in Business and Life, with Paul Brown. De la Vega decided to write the work due to the response he was receiving after the speeches he delivered at speaking engagements. The goal of the book was to provide career and life advice to youth and young professionals.[19] The book contains "four pillars of success" and "six pivotal points" in which he uses his personal story to structure his advice.[4] De la Vega has also written for periodicals including Cnet.[20]
Recognition[edit]
De la Vega was selected Executive of the Year by the Association of Latino Professionals in Finance and Accounting and has been listed as one of America’s “50 Most Important Hispanics in Technology and Business.” He is a past member of the board of Junior Achievement of Georgia, where he serves as the chairman of the JA Hispanic Initiative, a program to encourage Hispanic students to remain in school and prepare for success in the U.S. business world. In addition, he has served on the board of directors for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra[10] and the Georgia Aquarium.[21] He is a member of the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America, the organization's governing body[22] and is a board member for the Georgia chapter of the Boy Scouts of America. De la Vega was featured in HBO's The Latino List pt.2 where he discussed his background along with other impactful Latinos. In 2011 he was awarded the Emory University’s Global Innovation Award. He has also been a Trustee of Morehouse College.[23][24][25]

Early life and education[edit]
Ralph de la Vega was born in Cuba, and emigrated to the United States in 1962, at the age of ten. In an effort to flee the Castro dictatorship in that country, his family attempted to board a plane to Miami; however the border official stated that only Ralph’s papers were in order. He was sent to the US alone, where he stayed with the friend of an aunt. It took four years for his parents to join him.[3] Once his parents arrived, de la Vega took an after-school job sweeping the floors of a garment factory to help support the family. He was then promoted, and started making money selling the clothing made by the company.[4]
De la Vega eventually enrolled in a pre-engineering curriculum at Miami Dade College, and worked part-time as a draftsman at an engineering firm.[4] He then received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Florida Atlantic University. He later received an MBA from Northern Illinois University.[5][6] He also completed the Executive Program at the University of Virginia and received an honorary doctorate from Florida Atlantic.[7]
BellSouth[edit]
De la Vega started his career in 1974 with BellSouth (then Southern Bell) as a management assistant.[8] Over the years he held positions in Network Planning, Consumer Services, Engineering, and DSL and Operations.[5] In 1985 he became a director at the Bell's Communications Research Technical Education Center (Bellcore TEC).[4] He was later made responsible for all BellSouth Telecommunications Network Operations in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.[5] Afterwards he became the president of BellSouth Broadband Internet Services.[5][9] De la Vega eventually became the president of BellSouth Latin America, a role he held from 2002 to 2003.[10] In this job he was in charge of the wireless subsidiaries in eleven countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The CEOs of each company reported to de la Vega, who restructured the decision-making infrastructure of the group in order to create cooperative strategies and policies between the different firms. At the end of his first year as president, BellSouth Latin America turned a profit for the first time.[11]
AT&T[edit]
De la Vega served as the chief operating officer of Cingular Wireless,[12] starting in 2004.[10] In 2007 Cingular was acquired by SBC (itself later re-named AT&T),[13] and he was named CEO of AT&T Mobility.[14] De la Vega was one of the leaders of the merger.[3] At AT&T de la Vega formed relationships between the company’s mobile unit and automobile manufacturers, including General Motors, in order to grow the company’s market for car connectivity. He also pushed for promotions intended to draw subscribers away from AT&T’s competitors.[14] He also brought the iPhone to the company.[15] De la Vega was the CEO of AT&T Mobility until 2014, when he was promoted to President and CEO of AT&T’s combined Mobile & Business Solutions group.[13] One of the main goals of de la Vega in this position is to develop AT&T’s role in the Internet of Things and to deliver integrated services to business customers.[16] In 2016 he became the Vice Chairman of AT&T Inc. and CEO of AT&T Business Solutions and AT&T International.[17][18] Ralph De la Vega retired from this position on 31 December 2016.
Obstacles Welcome[edit]
In 2009 de la Vega coauthored the book Obstacles Welcome: How to Turn Adversity to Advantage in Business and Life, with Paul Brown. De la Vega decided to write the work due to the response he was receiving after the speeches he delivered at speaking engagements. The goal of the book was to provide career and life advice to youth and young professionals.[19] The book contains "four pillars of success" and "six pivotal points" in which he uses his personal story to structure his advice.[4] De la Vega has also written for periodicals including Cnet.[20]
Recognition[edit]
De la Vega was selected Executive of the Year by the Association of Latino Professionals in Finance and Accounting and has been listed as one of America’s “50 Most Important Hispanics in Technology and Business.” He is a past member of the board of Junior Achievement of Georgia, where he serves as the chairman of the JA Hispanic Initiative, a program to encourage Hispanic students to remain in school and prepare for success in the U.S. business world. In addition, he has served on the board of directors for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra[10] and the Georgia Aquarium.[21] He is a member of the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America, the organization's governing body[22] and is a board member for the Georgia chapter of the Boy Scouts of America. De la Vega was featured in HBO's The Latino List pt.2 where he discussed his background along with other impactful Latinos. In 2011 he was awarded the Emory University’s Global Innovation Award. He has also been a Trustee of Morehouse College.[23][24][25]

Ralph de la Vega, President and CEO of AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets, shares the lessons learned in business and in life along the journey from Cuba to Corporate America.
^^

Ralph de la Vega arrived in the United States from Cuba in 1962. He was alone. He was scared. He was 10. Separated from his parents by Cuban authorities just moments before they were to board a plane to Miami, de la Vega was baptized early-and abruptly-in the waters of adversity. It would be four long years before his mother, father, and sister gained legal passage to America. But while the boy would never have chosen such circumstance, it's the man who can look back and say he would not have changed it.
^^

In Obstacles Welcome, de la Vega recounts his journey as a young Cuban immigrant to president and CEO of AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets, a subsidiary of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T). A frontliner in the converging worlds of technology and communications, de la Vega takes readers behind the scenes of the Internet revolution, shares insights from the nation's top technology companies, and chronicles the incredible obstacles intrinsic to successfully merging the largest wireless operations in U.S. history-those of Cingular Wireless and AT&T Wireless.
^^

Obstacles Welcome is an innovation manifesto for those committed to bigger thinking and greater results both professionally and personally. He clearly defines how to:
^^

* Create a detailed action plan to boost success
^^

* Identify and take calculated risks without fear
^^

* Create a values-centric, decisive leadership style
^^

* Transform vision into measurable results
^^

* Recognize opportunities and overcome obstacles
^^

* Communicate well and build alignment
^^

* Unlearn thinking that hinders innovation
^^

* Dream big and throw off mental limits once and for all
^^

Opening a powerful cache of business strategy and in-the-trenches wisdom, de la Vega illustrates that within each obstacle we encounter, there's an opportunity that carries the potential to transform our thinking, our organizations, our communities, and our world.

Description


Ralph de la Vega, President and CEO of AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets, shares the lessons learned in business and in life along the journey from Cuba to Corporate America. Ralph de la Vega arrived in the United States from Cuba in 1962. He was alone. He was scared. He was 10. Separated from his parents by Cuban authorities just moments before they were to board a plane to Miami, de la Vega was baptized early—and abruptly—in the waters of adversity. It would be four long years before his mother, father, and sister gained legal passage to America. But while the boy would never have chosen such circumstance, it's the man who can look back and say he would not have changed it. In Obstacles Welcome, de la Vega recounts his journey as a young Cuban immigrant to president and CEO of AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets, a subsidiary of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T). A frontliner in the converging worlds of technology and communications, de la Vega takes readers behind the scenes of the Internet revolution, shares insights from the nation's top technology companies, and chronicles the incredible obstacles intrinsic to successfully merging the largest wireless operations in U.S. history—those of Cingular Wireless and AT&T Wireless. Obstacles Welcome is an innovation manifesto for those committed to bigger thinking and greater results both professionally and personally. He clearly defines how to: * Create a detailed action plan to boost success * Identify and take calculated risks without fear * Create a values-centric, decisive leadership style * Transform vision into measurable results * Recognize opportunities and overcome obstacles * Communicate well and build alignment * Unlearn thinking that hinders innovation * Dream big and throw off mental limits once and for all Opening a powerful cache of business strategy and in-the-trenches wisdom, de la Vega illustrates that within each obstacle we encounter, there's an opportunity that carries the potential to transform our thinking, our organizations, our communities, and our world. PRAISE FOR OBSTACLES WELCOME  ". . . [T]hrough his compelling story, Ralph shows how to turn almost any challenge into the opportunity of a lifetime. This is great insight for any professional or any young person aspiring to learn how to overcome obstacles and accept new challenges." — Randall Stephenson, Chairman & CEO, AT&T, Inc.  "I recommend this book to those looking to improve their opportunities, as well as those providing leadership in this diverse society." — Ambassador Andrew Young, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, former Mayor of Atlanta, former president of the National Council of Churches  "His journey is an inspirational story of leadership vision and the ability to achieve success in the face of enormous challenges and obstacles." — Gerry Czarnecki, President, CEO & Managing Partner, O2Media  "This book is a must-read for anyone not afraid to make your dreams come true, regardless of where you are in your professional or personal life." — Ernest Bromley, Chairman and CEO, Bromley Communications, LLC  "Without a doubt, this is one of the most inspiring books and one of the best business publications that I've read in my 40-plus years in the communications business." — John Graham, Chairman, Fleishman-Hillard Inc.  "Ralph de la Vega tells an All-American story for our times." — Henry Cisneros, Executive Chairman, CityView; former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; former Mayor of San Antonio

Description


Christian Encounters, a series of biographies from Thomas Nelson Publishers, highlights important lives from all ages and areas of the Church. Some are familiar faces. Others are unexpected guests. But all, through their relationships, struggles, prayers, and desires, uniquely illuminate our shared experience   When she arrived in the New World at eighteen, Anne Bradstreet was a reluctant passenger:  her old, comfortable lifestyle in England was quickly dashed against the rocks of the Massachusetts Bay. While the wilderness of America and the drama of establishing the Massachusetts Bay Colony at times overwhelmed her, she always took refuge in the belief that it was God's plan. Anne respected the Puritan teachings and followed them her entire life, always searching for God's hand in everything around her. But she also was inspired by a strong female leader of the day, Queen Elizabeth, and this influence taught Anne to push herself beyond the day's limitations. She managed her home, educated her children, encouraged her husband, and sought her Lord--all with a poet's heart.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
