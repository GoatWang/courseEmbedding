Professor Cercone started his 12 year litigation career in New York City at one of the country's largest law firms. While there, he worked on several high profile cases, including the Chrysler Antitrust case and the breakup of the Bell Telephone system.

Professor Cercone arrived at Cooley in 1996 and was promoted to full professor in 2003. In June of 2003, President LeDuc appointed him Associate Dean of Faculty. Professor Cercone has won numerous teaching recognition awards, including the Beattie Award, and has published frequently over his career on topics such as common law nuisance, hazardous waste management, the Clean Water Act, and most recently, the work product doctrine.

Video: Charles Horton Cooley: Looking Glass Self and the Effect of Primary Groups


Charles Horton Cooley was a sociologist who wanted to better understand society and human behavior. He believed that the influence of groups within a society had a strong impact on human behavior. In this lesson, we will discuss primary groups, the theory of the looking-glass self and the concept that one's self and society are distinctly one unit, not two.

Lesson Transcript




Instructor: 
Bethany Johnson





Charles Horton Cooley was a sociologist who wanted to better understand society and human behavior. He believed that the influence of groups within a society had a strong impact on human behavior. In this lesson, we will discuss primary groups, the theory of the looking-glass self and the concept that one's self and society are distinctly one unit, not two.
 Why Cooley Studied Groups and Social BehaviorCharles Horton Cooley was a sociologist who wanted to better understand why human beings behave the way they do. One of Cooley's most important contributions to sociology was his idea that by studying everyday social interactions between people, one could begin to better understand why people behave as they do. This is the basis of the interactionist perspective of sociology. Cooley stated that to understand behavior, we must first understand the meanings humans attach to certain situations and, thus, the behavior that is taught to go along with that situation. He believed that societies shape the lives of the people who live within them. 

  Cooley focused much of his work on primary groups.
 





Cooley's major contribution to sociology was the study of primary groups. Cooley coined the term 'primary group,' meaning that this is the first group one is introduced to and is the most influential on our learning of ideas, beliefs and ideals. When observing society, Cooley noticed that the more a society became industrialized, the more individualistic the members became. He saw that the people became more distant from each other, more competitive and were losing the connection to traditional family values and that of community. It was through his study of primary groups that Cooley hoped to instill more social unity and cohesiveness. While society has continued to evolve and change even at a more rapid pace, many of the social problems Cooley was concerned with still exist today. However, with Cooley's research, we better understand the importance of social unity and society's influence upon individuals. Cooley's CareerBorn in 1864 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as a son of a Michigan Supreme Court Judge, Charles Horton Cooley grew up in a household where education was highly valued and with high expectations placed upon him by his ambitious father. In 1894, Cooley earned his PhD from the University of Michigan. In 1905, he founded the American Sociological Association and in 1907 became a full professor of sociology at the University of Michigan. He remained teaching at the university for his entire career. Primary GroupsLike many sociologists, Cooley wanted to understand society better. As mentioned earlier, Cooley found that the more advanced a society became, the more individualistic people became. He witnessed the breakdown of social cohesion and traditional family. He was convinced that it was the small, intimate groups which influenced behavior the most, and with a breakdown of these primary groups, we also had a breakdown of human behavior. 

  Families are examples of primary groups.
 





Cooley coined the term primary groups, which is defined as groups characterized by intimate, face-to-face association and cooperation. Primary groups come together for expressive reasons - to provide emotional support, love, companionship and security. It is through these groups that one begins to develop the sense of self. The Looking Glass SelfCooley is one of the founders of the interactionist perspective, which seeks to explain society by looking at the everyday forms of interaction between individuals. Cooley's theory of self is one in which we learn who we are through our interactions with others. This is known as the looking glass self. This basically means that our self-image comes from our own self-reflection and from what others think of us. Cooley believed that it is through these interactions that one begins to develop an idea of who they are; therefore, the self is a product of our social interactions. There are three phases to the development of self, according to the looking glass self theory: 
We imagine how we present ourselves to others. 
We imagine how others evaluate us. 
We develop some sort of feeling about ourselves based upon our perception of what we think others have of us. 
The 'self,' then, emerges from one's individual imagination of what we think others think of us. One critical element to this is that we may perceive someone's impression of us incorrectly. For example: a parent criticizes something their child does; the child then feels that the parent thinks they are stupid, and thus, the child then begins to believe, 'I am stupid.' Using the 'social mirror' as a measurement of ourselves, a positive reaction from someone creates a positive self-concept; a negative reaction, a negative self-concept. Cooley states that this is a never-ending process, for we are always meeting new people and reevaluating ourselves based upon our impression of what they think of us.

Cooley's View of Self and SocietyCooley's sociology is decidedly holistic. He speaks of society as being an organism. He states this by emphasizing the systematic interrelations between all parts of society and social processes. To quote Cooley: 'If…we say that society is an organism, we mean . . . that it is a complex of forms of processes each of which is living and growing by interaction with the others, the whole being so unified that what takes place in one part affects all the rest. It is a vast tissue of reciprocal activity.' Cooley, therefore, believed that self and society could be equated as the same entity. He once said, 'Self and society are twin-born.' He believed that one could not exist, let alone develop and thrive, without the other. Cooley stated that an individual could not develop a sense of who they are without something to compare it to. Thus, states Cooley, individuals in the same group and society are dependent upon one another for the development of their self-identity. Cooley argued that a person's self grows out of a person's commerce with others. Cooley stated, 'The social origin of his life comes by the pathway of intercourse with other persons.' The self, to Cooley, is not first individual and then social; it arises side by side through communication. One's consciousness of himself is a reflection of the ideas about himself that he attributes to other minds. Thus, there can be no isolated selves. Cooley stated, 'There is no sense of 'I' without its correlative sense of you, or he, or they.' Lesson SummaryCooley is known in sociology for his contribution to the development of the interactionist perspective and for his development of the looking glass self. He was one of the first to define the importance of society in forming the individual or self and the importance of primary groups. His organic link between society and self remains one of Cooley's crucial contributions to the area of modern-day psychology and sociology. Learning OutcomesAfter completing the lesson, you should be able to: 
Describe Charles Horton Cooley's contribution to sociology 
Define primary groups, interactionist perspective and the looking glass self 
Name the three phases of the development of the self 
Explain the way Cooley believed self and society interact

Charles H. Cooley








 


Charles Horton Cooley
August 17, 1864 - May 7, 1929"There
is nothing less to our credit than our neglect of the foreigner and his
children, unless it be the arrogance most of us betray when we set out
to 'Americanize' him." –Charles Horton Cooley
Charles
Horton Cooley was born on August 17, 1864 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the
fourth of six children. He was the son of Mary Elizabeth Horton and the
renowned law school professor and State Supreme Court Justice Thomas
McIntyre Cooley. Young Cooley was somewhat of a withdrawn, passive
child. He felt intimidated and alienated by his successful father, a
characteristic that haunted him for the rest of his life. Cooley
attended the public schools of Ann Arbor and graduated high school in
1880.
Cooley attended
college at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor where his father once
taught. After seven years, interrupted by bouts of illness (some
apparently psychosomatic), he graduated with a degree in mechanical
engineering. After a period of travel to Europe, Cooley began work as a
draftsman and statistician. While in school, he took several courses in
history, philosophy and economics. These subjects peaked Cooley’s
interest, and he began independent readings of Darwin, Spencer and the
German sociologist Albert Schaeffle. Cooley returned to the University
of Michigan in 1890 for graduate work in political economy and
sociology. Because there was yet no formal instruction in sociology at
the University of Michigan, he was forwarded test questions by Franklin
Giddings. Cooley’s dissertation, “The Theory of Transportation” was
most notable for its conclusion that towns and cities tend to be
situated at the convergence of transportation routes. Cooley received
his PhD in philosophy in 1894.
Soon thereafter,
Cooley moved to Washington, D.C. to work for the Interstate Commerce
Commission and later the Bureau of the Census. He read his dissertation
paper, as well as a second work, “Social Significance of Street Railways” at a meeting of the American Economic Association in 1890.
Cooley married Elsie
Jones, daughter of first Dean of the Homeopathic Medical College at the
University of Michigan, in 1890. She was very outgoing and energetic
and effectively balanced out Cooley’s shy, retiring side. They lived in
Ann Arbor, within close proximity to the University, and had three
children: a boy and two girls. Cooley was said to have enjoyed long
walks with companions, camping trips to Canada and cooking picnic
suppers for his wife. He built a cabin at Crystal Lake in Northern
Michigan, where he and his family went swimming and boating. Cooley was
also fond of amateur botany and bird watching.
In 1892, Cooley
accepted an appointment as an instructor of political economy at the
University of Michigan. He soon became an assistant professor of
sociology and taught the university’s first sociology course in 1899.
Cooley swiftly progressed to associate professor status in 1904 and
became a full professor 1907. He was noted to have been invited to
positions in other institutions around the country (on one occasion
called to Columbia by Giddings), but he never wanted to leave Ann Arbor
where his father and wife’s father both taught.
Cooley was fortunate
to have had no financial worries in his life. He lived through an age
in which the “publish or perish” philosophy had not yet developed, and
he was able to enjoy a life of leisurely reflection and study. Cooley
spent a great deal of time speculating and contemplating the subject of
the self. He observed the development of his own children, which he
used to construct his theories.
Cooley was greatly
inspired by the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henry David
Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Charles Darwin. In his own works,
Cooley sought to highlight the connection between society and the
individual and felt that the two could only be understood in
relationship to each other. One’s personality comes from one’s
influences. He coined the concept of the “looking-glass self”, the
social determination of the self, which later influenced George Herbert
Mead’s theory of self and symbolic interactionism. Cooley ultimately
wanted to show that the facts of social life are mental, and the
conduct of persons, groups and institutions are the result of
fundamental mental phenomena.
Cooley produced his next work, “Personal Competition” (1899)
in which he noted an alarming trend. As the United States was expanding
and becoming more industrialized, people seemed to become more
individualistic and competitive, exhibiting less concern for
traditional family and neighborhood. Cooley asserted that primary
groups, a term he described as the foundation of one’s morals,
sentiments and ideals, are ethically good because they provoke a sense
of safety, belonging, fairness and consideration. He hoped that by
calling attention to the significance of primary groups, individuals
might revive traditional values and maintain social cohesion.
In Human Nature and the Social Order (1902),
Cooley foreshadowed Mead’s discussion of the symbolism of the self,
delving into the effects of social responses and social participation.
In Social Organization (1909),
Cooley expanded his ideas further, accentuating the importance of
primary groups. He believed that the impact of one’s primary group was
so great that one would cling to primary ideals in more complex
associations and even generate new primary groupings within formal
organizations.
In 1918 Cooley wrote Social Process.
This work emphasized the nonrational, provisional nature of social
organization and the impact of social competition. Cooley declared that
present troubles were caused by the conflict between primary group
values and institutional values. He also produced Life and the Student (1927), a collection of writings accumulated throughout his life, and Sociological Theory and Social Research (1930), pieces on social ecology.
Cooley participated in
the founding of the American Sociological Society in 1905. As a member,
he presented a paper at a 1907 meeting, "Social Consciousness", and in
1917 "Social Control in International Relations". He served as its eighth President in 1918. His Presidential address, delivered at the 1918 Annual Meeting was entitled "A Primary Culture for Democracy."
Cooley later published
various articles in the Society’s journals, including “Reflections Upon
the Sociology of Herbert Spencer” (American Journal of Sociology 1920, 26: 129-145), and "Now and Then" originally read at a dinner of the 1923 Annual Meeting (Journal of Applied Sociology 1924, 8: 259-262).
In 1928, Cooley’s health began to fail, and in March of 1929 he was diagnosed with cancer. He died on May 7, 1929.
"Our individual lives cannot, generally, be works of art unless the social order is also." –Charles Horton Cooley
