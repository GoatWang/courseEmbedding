Information contained in posts has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but not guaranteed. You should note that the materials on the social media platforms are provided "as is" without any express or implied warranties. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

History
Founding and early years
William Blair & Company opened on January 8, 1935, as Blair, Bonner & Co. The firm was founded by William M. Blair and Francis A. Bonner who had worked together at investment firm Lee, Higginson & Co., prior to its collapse in 1932-1933.
In its early days, it assisted the growth of the Household Finance Corporation, Continental Casualty and Continental Assurance companies (today CNA Insurance). The firm focused on raising capital, primarily for midwestern growth-oriented companies, through its own originated issues rather than distribute securities for larger Wall Street-based investment banks.
In 1941 Bonner left the company, and it was renamed William Blair & Company. In 1946 Blair's sons, William McCormick Blair, Jr., Edward McCormick Blair and Bowen Blair joined the firm. Blair, Sr. stepped down as managing partner in 1961, and handed the reins over to his son Edward. William M. Blair remained a senior partner of William Blair & Co. until his death in 1982 (age 97).
Under Edward Blair and Edgar D. Jannotta (managing partner from 1977 to 1994) the firm experienced two difficult periods: the late 1960s, when the inability to process trades resulted in a paper crunch that threatened the industry with shutdown, and the 1970s, when the market value of securities and underwriting activity declined substantially.[citation needed] The firm continued to help finance growth companies completing initial public offerings for companies such as Molex, Oil-Dri Corporation, and Safety-Kleen during the 1970s.
Growth and development
In the 1980s, the firm generally avoided many of the hottest areas including underwriting junk bonds, hostile takeovers and merger arbitrage.[citation needed] The company expanded its geographic reach, opening additional offices in London and Liechtenstein to better serve international clients. It enlarged its corporate client base to encompass more companies throughout the United States beyond the midwest and extended its corporate financial services.[citation needed]
During the 1990s, business continued to expand dramatically.

William Blair Capital Partners




William Blair Capital Partners logo


Main article: Chicago Growth Partners
Founded in 1982, William Blair Capital Partners was the investment arm of William Blair & Company. During the 1980s, WBCP was an active investor in leveraged buyout transactions.
In 2004, the principals of William Blair Capital Partners completed a spinout from William Blair to form Chicago Growth Partners, a private equity firm focusing on investments in growth capital and leveraged buyouts of lower middle market growth companies.[5] The primary motivation for the departure of the Chicago Growth Partners team from William Blair was to gain access to a more diversified base of institutional investors that was limited by the group's involvement with the investment bank.
In August 2006, the remaining partners of William Blair Capital Partners suspended efforts to raise William Blair Capital Partners VIII, which had been reportedly targeted at about $250 million. The remaining team left William Blair to found a new private equity firm, Seyen Capital.[6]
Office locations
The bank operates from 16 cities across 5 continents.

History
Founding and early years
William Blair & Company opened on January 8, 1935, as Blair, Bonner & Co. The firm was founded by William M. Blair and Francis A. Bonner who had worked together at investment firm Lee, Higginson & Co., prior to its collapse in 1932-1933.
In its early days, it assisted the growth of the Household Finance Corporation, Continental Casualty and Continental Assurance companies (today CNA Insurance). The firm focused on raising capital, primarily for midwestern growth-oriented companies, through its own originated issues rather than distribute securities for larger Wall Street-based investment banks.
In 1941 Bonner left the company, and it was renamed William Blair & Company. In 1946 Blair's sons, William McCormick Blair, Jr., Edward McCormick Blair and Bowen Blair joined the firm. Blair, Sr. stepped down as managing partner in 1961, and handed the reins over to his son Edward. William M. Blair remained a senior partner of William Blair & Co. until his death in 1982 (age 97).
Under Edward Blair and Edgar D. Jannotta (managing partner from 1977 to 1994) the firm experienced two difficult periods: the late 1960s, when the inability to process trades resulted in a paper crunch that threatened the industry with shutdown, and the 1970s, when the market value of securities and underwriting activity declined substantially.[citation needed] The firm continued to help finance growth companies completing initial public offerings for companies such as Molex, Oil-Dri Corporation, and Safety-Kleen during the 1970s.
Growth and development
In the 1980s, the firm generally avoided many of the hottest areas including underwriting junk bonds, hostile takeovers and merger arbitrage.[citation needed] The company expanded its geographic reach, opening additional offices in London and Liechtenstein to better serve international clients. It enlarged its corporate client base to encompass more companies throughout the United States beyond the midwest and extended its corporate financial services.[citation needed]
During the 1990s, business continued to expand dramatically. Between 1991 and 1996 William Blair & Company lead managed or co-managed 196 equity underwriting transactions representing $13.6 billion in capital. William Blair & Company also expanded its debt finance services, becoming active in bond financing and bond trading. The firm continued to serve traditional debt-issuing clients such as private corporations and states, counties, municipalities and school districts while expanding this client base to encompass healthcare facilities, institutions of higher learning and transportation authorities. The firm also earned a growing national reputation for successfully floating bonds for cultural institutions.[citation needed]
Recent years
In 1995 the firm opened a Zurich office, followed in 1996 by a San Francisco office, and in 1999 by a new office in Hartford. William Blair also expanded its international presence by increasing the size of its Tokyo and London offices. In August 2006, William Blair opened an institutional sales and trading office in downtown Boston, as part of an effort to locate in regions with a high concentration of clients. In 2007, the firm opened a new representative office in Shanghai and another institutional sales office in New York.[1]
In 2017, William Blair's Chicago headquarters will move to 150 N. Riverside Plaza. The new headquarters will be Sustainability LEED-CS Gold Pre-certified with a maximization of open space, 1.5-acre park, plus 100% green roof.[2]
Business overview
Investment banking
William Blair's investment banking group focuses on high-growth companies, executing advisory and financing services such as mergers and acquisitions, public equity offerings, and private capital raises. From 2010 to 2014, the investment banking group completed more than 330 M&A transactions, worth a total of $73 billion in value.[3]
These deals involved parties in 36 countries and five continents; nearly one-third of all transactions were cross-border. During that same period, the firm was an underwriter on more than 20 percent of all U.S. initial public offerings and raised nearly $100 billion in public and private financing.
Equity research
The firm is also known for its equity research unit, which was named the "Most Trusted Research" in Greenwich Associates' 2014 survey of small and mid-cap portfolio managers. In the 2015 survey, William Blair ranked No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 in nine categories.[4]
Asset management and institutional sales
William Blair is a long-term partner to institutional and individual investors around the globe, with more than $72 billion in client assets through customized portfolios, separately managed accounts, mutual funds, SICAVs, and retail accounts. Using a disciplined research process, William Blair provides institutional investors active management across the market-capitalization spectrum in U.S., international, and global markets.
William Blair Capital Partners




William Blair Capital Partners logo


Main article: Chicago Growth Partners
Founded in 1982, William Blair Capital Partners was the investment arm of William Blair & Company. During the 1980s, WBCP was an active investor in leveraged buyout transactions.
In 2004, the principals of William Blair Capital Partners completed a spinout from William Blair to form Chicago Growth Partners, a private equity firm focusing on investments in growth capital and leveraged buyouts of lower middle market growth companies.[5] The primary motivation for the departure of the Chicago Growth Partners team from William Blair was to gain access to a more diversified base of institutional investors that was limited by the group's involvement with the investment bank.
In August 2006, the remaining partners of William Blair Capital Partners suspended efforts to raise William Blair Capital Partners VIII, which had been reportedly targeted at about $250 million. The remaining team left William Blair to found a new private equity firm, Seyen Capital.[6]
Office locations
The bank operates from 16 cities across 5 continents.

William Blair & Company opened on January 8, 1935, as Blair, Bonner & Co. The firm was founded by William M. Blair and Francis A. Bonner who had worked together at investment firm Lee, Higginson & Co., prior to its collapse in 1932-1933.
In its early days, it assisted the growth of the Household Finance Corporation, Continental Casualty and Continental Assurance companies (today CNA Insurance). The firm focused on raising capital, primarily for midwestern growth-oriented companies, through its own originated issues rather than distribute securities for larger Wall Street-based investment banks.
In 1941 Bonner left the company, and it was renamed William Blair & Company. In 1946 Blair's sons, William McCormick Blair, Jr., Edward McCormick Blair and Bowen Blair joined the firm. Blair, Sr. stepped down as managing partner in 1961, and handed the reins over to his son Edward. William M. Blair remained a senior partner of William Blair & Co. until his death in 1982 (age 97).
Under Edward Blair and Edgar D. Jannotta (managing partner from 1977 to 1994) the firm experienced two difficult periods: the late 1960s, when the inability to process trades resulted in a paper crunch that threatened the industry with shutdown, and the 1970s, when the market value of securities and underwriting activity declined substantially.[citation needed] The firm continued to help finance growth companies completing initial public offerings for companies such as Molex, Oil-Dri Corporation, and Safety-Kleen during the 1970s.
Growth and development
In the 1980s, the firm generally avoided many of the hottest areas including underwriting junk bonds, hostile takeovers and merger arbitrage.[citation needed] The company expanded its geographic reach, opening additional offices in London and Liechtenstein to better serve international clients. It enlarged its corporate client base to encompass more companies throughout the United States beyond the midwest and extended its corporate financial services.[citation needed]
During the 1990s, business continued to expand dramatically. Between 1991 and 1996 William Blair & Company lead managed or co-managed 196 equity underwriting transactions representing $13.6 billion in capital. William Blair & Company also expanded its debt finance services, becoming active in bond financing and bond trading. The firm continued to serve traditional debt-issuing clients such as private corporations and states, counties, municipalities and school districts while expanding this client base to encompass healthcare facilities, institutions of higher learning and transportation authorities. The firm also earned a growing national reputation for successfully floating bonds for cultural institutions.[citation needed]
Recent years
In 1995 the firm opened a Zurich office, followed in 1996 by a San Francisco office, and in 1999 by a new office in Hartford. William Blair also expanded its international presence by increasing the size of its Tokyo and London offices. In August 2006, William Blair opened an institutional sales and trading office in downtown Boston, as part of an effort to locate in regions with a high concentration of clients. In 2007, the firm opened a new representative office in Shanghai and another institutional sales office in New York.[1]
In 2017, William Blair's Chicago headquarters will move to 150 N. Riverside Plaza. The new headquarters will be Sustainability LEED-CS Gold Pre-certified with a maximization of open space, 1.5-acre park, plus 100% green roof.[2]
Business overview
Investment banking
William Blair's investment banking group focuses on high-growth companies, executing advisory and financing services such as mergers and acquisitions, public equity offerings, and private capital raises. From 2010 to 2014, the investment banking group completed more than 330 M&A transactions, worth a total of $73 billion in value.[3]
These deals involved parties in 36 countries and five continents; nearly one-third of all transactions were cross-border. During that same period, the firm was an underwriter on more than 20 percent of all U.S. initial public offerings and raised nearly $100 billion in public and private financing.
Equity research
The firm is also known for its equity research unit, which was named the "Most Trusted Research" in Greenwich Associates' 2014 survey of small and mid-cap portfolio managers. In the 2015 survey, William Blair ranked No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 in nine categories.[4]
Asset management and institutional sales

William Blair Capital Partners




William Blair Capital Partners logo


Main article: Chicago Growth Partners
Founded in 1982, William Blair Capital Partners was the investment arm of William Blair & Company. During the 1980s, WBCP was an active investor in leveraged buyout transactions.
In 2004, the principals of William Blair Capital Partners completed a spinout from William Blair to form Chicago Growth Partners, a private equity firm focusing on investments in growth capital and leveraged buyouts of lower middle market growth companies.[5] The primary motivation for the departure of the Chicago Growth Partners team from William Blair was to gain access to a more diversified base of institutional investors that was limited by the group's involvement with the investment bank.
In August 2006, the remaining partners of William Blair Capital Partners suspended efforts to raise William Blair Capital Partners VIII, which had been reportedly targeted at about $250 million. The remaining team left William Blair to found a new private equity firm, Seyen Capital.[6]
Office locations
The bank operates from 16 cities across 5 continents.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
