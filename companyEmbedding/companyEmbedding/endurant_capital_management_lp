Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Halozyme Therapeutics (NASDAQ:HALO) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 2 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $14.82 (14.45% upside)

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:KERX) from a hold rating to a buy rating in a research report released on Wednesday. They currently have $8.75 price target on the biopharmaceutical company’s stock. 
According to Zacks, “Keryx intends to focus on the growth of Auryxia in the U.S. dialysis market. Meanwhile, the company’s label expansion efforts on Auryxia in the iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) indication seem to be encouraging, given that the IDA market holds great potential. The FDA accepted for review the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Auryxia tablets for the same indication and has set the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date as Nov 6, 2017.  A potential approval should boost sales.. Moreover, shares of the company have outperformed the Medical-Biomed/Genetic Market  in year to date. However, considering that the company is heavily dependent on Auryxia for growth, any further interruption in the supply of Auryxia will hamper its growth trajectory, going forward.”
Several other brokerages have also commented on KERX. Maxim Group raised their price target on shares of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals from $7.00 to $9.00 and gave the company a buy rating in a research note on Monday, May 15th.

One research analyst  has rated the stock with a sell rating, six have issued  a hold rating and five have assigned  a buy rating to the company. The stock currently has an average rating of Hold and a consensus price target of $8.27.




Shares of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (KERX) traded down 1.89% during midday trading on Wednesday, reaching $7.79. The company’s stock had a trading volume of 1,453,471 shares. The stock has a 50 day moving average of $6.45 and a 200-day moving average of $5.85. The company’s market capitalization is $844.95 million. Keryx Biopharmaceuticals has a 1-year low of $4.03 and a 1-year high of $8.38. 
Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:KERX) last announced its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 4th. The biopharmaceutical company reported ($0.21) EPS for the quarter, missing the consensus estimate of ($0.18) by $0.03. Keryx Biopharmaceuticals had a negative net margin of 387.12% and a negative return on equity of 1,122.28%.
