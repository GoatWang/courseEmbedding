Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and "best-efforts" basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of 
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $60,000 as anticipated.

       Gross proceeds        $ 15,000 $ 30,000 $ 45,000 $ 60,000
     Offering expenses       $ 7,000  $ 7,000  $ 7,000  $ 7,000 
        Net proceeds         $ 8,000  $ 23,000 $ 38,000 $ 53,000
SEC reporting and compliance $ 7,000  $ 7,000  $ 7,000  $ 7,000 
   Establishing an office    $   -    $ 2,000  $ 4,000  $ 5,000 
    Website development      $   -    $ 1,500  $ 3,500  $ 4,500 
    Sales person salary      $   -    $ 1,500  $ 2,500  $ 3,500 
     3D Milling Machine      $   -    $ 3,500  $ 7,000  $ 14,000
       Raw materials         $  700   $ 2,000  $ 4,000  $ 6,000 
 Marketing and advertising   $  300   $ 2,000  $ 4,000  $ 6,000 
       Lease expenses        $   -    $ 1,500  $ 3,000  $ 3,000 
   Miscellaneous expenses    $   -    $ 2,000  $ 3,000  $ 4,000 

* SEC reporting and compliance costs will be approximately $7,000. Therefore, in
  the scenario of selling 25% of the maximum offering amount, after paying
  offering expenses SEC reporting and compliance we will have a $1,000 and will
  be able to use them. If we need additional funds to meet the SEC reporting and
  compliance obligations Jose Galarza, our director, has verbally agreed to loan
  the company funds to complete the registration process.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Jose Galarza,
our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to
complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the
proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business
plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin
Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Galarza will not be paid any compensation
or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Galarza. Mr. Galarza will be repaid from
revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.

As of November 30, 2016, our company has generated limited revenues of $4,300
from selling our kalabases and bombillas to our first customer Tienda Calabaza
Mate the sales contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration
statement.


Many companies in this sector have begun to experiment with the material for
production. Some are making kalabas even silicone now. We chose the path of the
most useful and reliable material such as wood. For example to compare with
pumpkin from which the initial production of kalabas was started from, wood
leaves its taste and smell as well as a more durable and long lasting. 

Our company will make special beautiful patterns on our kalabas with our 3D
Milling machine. We can make individual and unique engraving on our product.
Kalmin Corp. will give the originality and beauty to the manufactured products
that will release us from the crowd.


Company Description
We are an early-stage company formed to create special equipment for drinking 
mate tea – Kalabas.

We have developed twelve months' business plan, purchased and set up our first
3D Milling Machine and signed a lease agreement for a 1-year term. To the date
we have set up our first 3D Milling


 Machine, tested its operation and produced a
range of demonstration samples to attract of potential business partners and
fulfilled first two orders of our items for our first customer Tienda Calabaza
Mate.

About Mate tea.

We suppose that mate tea is one of the most useful drinks in the world. That
requires special equipment for use, such as Kalabas and Bombilla. Nowadays mate
is acquiring more and more fans.

Official research scientists say that mate tea contains practically all the
vitamins and substances necessary for the maintenance of normal human life.
There is resin fiber, volatile oil, tannin, which is found in many plant
substances. Besides - carotene, group A, C, E, B1, B2 vitamins, vitamin
B-complex group in a higher concentration than the well-known honey bees    
uterus, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, magnesium, calcium, iron,
sodium, potassium, manganese, silicon, phosphate, sulfur, hydrochloric acid,
chlorophyll, choline, inositol. In its conclusions, the scientists pointed out
that a plant with so many essential and vital nutrients - extremely rare in
nature. 1 2 3

About our Kalabas and Bombilla.

We will produce kalabas for drinking mate tea. There are many options for the
production and we choose to use wood. Kalabas (calabash) is a traditional vessel
for drinking yerba mate. In ancient times, Indians kalabas was manufactured from
wood gourd. Later, they began to produce vessels of wood, fret, iron framing.
The second mandatory attribute is Bombilla. Bombilla previously made of thin
hollow trunks of plants. Today it is a whole industry; they are made of metal
(stainless steel), silver. The top of the tube is slightly flat mouthpiece,
which may be gold-plated or silver, and at the bottom - with a special filter.
Bombilla may be straight or slightly curved.

are planning to rent a bigger office when are operations are expanded and we
attract more customers.

PROSPECTUS

THE
INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT COMPLETE AND MAY BE CHANGED.
THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE.
THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS
NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE
THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED.

KALMIN
CORP.

3,000,000
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

$0.02 PER
SHARE

This is
the initial offering of common stock of Kalmin Corp. and no public
market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are
offering for sale a total of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a
fixed price of $0.02 per share. There is no minimum number of
shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we
will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered
shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten,
best efforts basis, which means our President Jose Galarza, will
attempt to sell the shares.

This
Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to
the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him
for any shares he may sell. In offering the securities on our
behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer
registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price
of $0.02 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days
from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall
terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240
days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date
when the sale of all 3,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the
Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the
company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale
of all 3,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement
of which this Prospectus is part.

Kalmin
Corp. is a development stage company and as of the date of this
filing we have been involved primarily in organizational
activities. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a
high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can
afford a loss of your investment. Our independent registered public
accountant has issued an audit opinion for Kalmin Corp., which
includes a statement expressing doubt as to our ability to continue
as a going concern.

There has
been no market for our securities and a public market may never
develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained.
Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the
over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the
registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have
a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) for our common stock to
be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To
be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their
quarterly and annual filings
with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated
with our reporting obligations, we will not be able to apply for
quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market
maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no
assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock
exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock
will develop.

PROSPECTUS
SUMMARY

AS USED
IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES,
“WE,” “US,” “OUR,” AND
“KALMIN CORP.” REFERS TO KALMIN CORP. THE FOLLOWING
SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE
IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE
MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON
STOCK.

KALMIN
CORP.

We are a
development stage company and intend to commence operations in
production business area, particularly in production of kalabas
cups. The kalabases can be different size and facture, various
engraving and design. The main factor is that we can do individual
engraving and design and the customer can choose from our range of
samples or create his own design of kalabas cup.

Kalmin
Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on July 20, 2016. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business
operations (See “Description of Business” and
“Use of Proceeds”). To implement our plan of operations
we require a minimum of $15,000 for the next twelve months as
described in our Plan of Operations. Our sole officer and director,
Jose Galarza has verbally agreed to loan the needed amount for the
Company through the registration and production process. There is
no assurance that we will generate significant revenue in the first
twelve months after completion of our offering or ever generate any
revenue. Being a development stage company, we have very limited
operating history. As of August 31, 2016 we have developed our
business plan for a period of 12 months, registered the domain name
for our website and filled it with initial information about the
company, signed a lease agreement for a period of one year with the
option of expansion and signed a sales contract for distribution of
kalabases. In accordance with our Plan of Operations if we are
unable to raise a minimum funding of $15,000 required to conduct
our business over the next twelve months, our business will be
harmed. After the 12-month period, we may need additional financing
to continue our operations. Our principal executive office is
located at Alberdi 1045, Caacupe, Paraguay. Our phone number is +1
(702) 879-4171.

To the
date of this filing, November 14, 2016 our company Kalmin Corp. has
generated limited revenues of $4,300 from selling our kalabases and
bombillas to our first customer Tienda Calabaza Mate the sales
contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration
statement.

As we
have a limited operating history and have no revenues as of August
31, 2016 we are a “shell company,” as applicable
federal securities law defines that term. We expect that we will
continue to be a “shell company” until we have more
operations and have substantial revenues and assets. We anticipate
that if we receive $60,000 from this offering we should have enough
money to expand our business of kalabases production that will be
sufficient to cause us to not be considered as a “shell
company”. We cannot provide any guarantee or assurance,
however, that in the event
we raise $60,000 from this offering we will have enough money to
engage in profitable operations. During the time that we are a
“shell company”, holders of our restricted securities
will not be able to rely on Rule 144 in connection with the sale of
those restricted securities.

We have no
plans, arrangements, commitments or understandings to engage in a
merger with or acquisition of another company or an unidentified
company or companies, or other entity or person.

As of the
date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our
common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our
securities will ever develop. The company is publicly offering its
shares to raise funds in order for our business to develop its
operations and increase its likelihood of commercial success. Our
sole officer and director, Mr. Galarza will be devoting
approximately twenty hours a week to our operations, because we do
not need to devote more time at the current stage of our business.
As far as we will increase the number of customers, our sole
officer and director will devote more time on Kalmin Corp. As a
result, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times, which
are convenient to our sole officer and director Mr. Galarza.

RISK
FACTORS

An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You
should carefully consider the risks described below and the other
information in this prospectus before investing in our common
stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating
results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The
trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later
date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all
or part of your investment.

RISKS
ASSOCIATED TO OUR BUSINESS

WE ARE A
DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN
OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

We were
incorporated on July 20, 2016 and till current time we have
commenced limited business operations such as formed the company,
developed our business plan, set up our web site, and leased and
office space, and we have purchased our 3D Milling machine and raw
materials. We are newly created company. Potential investors should
be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies.
The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays
encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to
undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited
to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate
sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs
and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that
we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any
substantial revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into
the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of
our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to
continue business operations. There is no history
upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will
prove successful. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks,
our business will most likely be harmed.

We require
minimum funding of approximately $15,000 to conduct our proposed
operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise
this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to
funding we may utilize funds from Jose Galarza, our sole officer
and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow
us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in
connection with the filing of this registration statement and
operation expenses. However, Mr. Galarza has no formal commitment,
arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the
company. His agreement to loan funds to Kalmin Corp. is verbal and
this verbal commitment is filed as exhibit to this registration
statement. After one year we may need additional financing. We do
not currently have any arrangements for additional
financing.

If we are
successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to
commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide
investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise
sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our
plan of operations.

AS OF
AUGUST 31, 2016 WE HAVE YET TO EARN REVENUE AND OUR ABILITY TO
START AND SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO
RAISE FINANCING. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT HAS
EXPRESSED A DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING
CONCERN.

Our
future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon
future profitable operations in production of kalabas cups.
Further, the finances required to fully develop our plan cannot be
predicted with any certainty and may exceed any estimates we set
forth. These factors raise a doubt that we will be able to continue
as a going concern. GBH CPAs, PC, our independent registered public
accounting firm, has expressed a doubt about our ability to start
and continue as a going concern.

This
opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional
funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. In
case if our sole officer and director Mr. Galarza is not able to
loan to the company needed amount of funds, and in case if the
company is not generating sufficient amount of $15,000 from selling
kalabases we will not be able to complete our business plan. As a
result, we may have to liquidate our business and you may lose your
investment. You should consider our independent registered public
accountant’s comments when determining if an investment in
Kalmin Corp. is suitable.

WE ARE
DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO DEVELOP
OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE
SIGNIFICANT REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO
OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.


As of
August 31, 2016, we do not have any income and just recently
starting our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be
sufficient for us to achieve sufficient revenues and profitable
operations. We may need additional funds to achieve a sustainable
sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of
revenues.
There is no assurance that any additional financing will be
available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.

WE FACE
COMPETITION FROM LARGER AND WELL ESTABLISHED COMPANIES, WHICH COULD
HARM OUR BUSINESS AND ABILITY TO OPERATE PROFITABLY.

Our work
area is extensive. There are many different concepts of kalabases
production in Paraguay and our services are not a lot unique to
their services. Even though the industry is fragmented, it has a
number of well-established companies, such as Industrias Acha
Sacif, Alberto Calatrava San Isidro and others, which are
profitable and have developed a brand name. Marketing tactics
implemented by our competitors could impact our limited financial
resources and adversely affect our ability to compete in our
market.

BECAUSE
WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN
MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO
OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND
OPERATIONS OR OUR BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED.

Due to
the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we have limited
marketing activities and may not be able to make our products known
to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing
activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to
operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, our operations
will be harmed.

BECAUSE
WE WILL IMPORT OUR RAW MATERIALS FROM OVERSEAS, A DISRUPTION IN THE
DELIVERY OF IMPORTED PRODUCTS MAY HAVE A GREATER EFFECT ON US THAN
ON OUR COMPETITORS.

We will
import our equipment and some of raw materials from overseas.
Because we plan to purchase our raw materials from abroad and ship
them to our locations in Paraguay, we believe that disruptions in
import shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on
competitors who manufacture and/or warehouse products in the place
of location. Deliveries of our products may be disrupted through
factors such as:

(1)      
Raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political
unrest;

(2)      
Problems with ocean shipping, including work stoppages and shipping
container shortages;

(3)      
Increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing
delays in shipments; and

(4)      
Economic crises, international disputes and wars.

Also if
there are any issues regarding shipping raw materials or equipment
from overseas we consider an option of purchasing raw materials for
our production from Americans or European  suppliers, which
could cause price increases. It may impact out financial part and
we will spend more funds on buying local raw materials and as a
result we might need additional financing. 

 




11




 

 

  

 

 
   

PROBLEMS
WITH PRODUCT QUALITY OR PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING DEFECTS, IN
THE PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN CUSTOMERS
AND REVENUE, UNEXPECTED EXPENSES AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE FOR OUR
COMPANY.

Because
we are sourcing our raw materials from overseas we may encounter
issues with product quality and consistency. If we deliver products
with errors or defects or if there is a perception that our
products contain errors or defects, our credibility and the market
acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed.

The
possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur
substantial expense to repair or replace defective product.


BECAUSE
OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN SUBSTANTIAL PART OF OUR
OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE
DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY
SHAREHOLDERS.

Mr.
Galarza, our sole officer and director, will own substantial part
of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will
have significant influence in determining the outcome of all
corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of
directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or
substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or
cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Galarza may differ
from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in
corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other
shareholders.

BECAUSE
COMPANY’S HEADQUARTER AND ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE
UNITED STATES, U.S. INVESTORS MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN
ATTEMPTING TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS AND TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS
BASED UPON U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND ITS
NON-U.S. RESIDENT OFFICER AND DIRECTOR.

While we
are organized under the laws of State of Nevada, our officer and
director is non-U.S. resident also our headquarters together with
assets are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may
be difficult for investors to affect service of process on them in
the United States and to enforce in the United States judgments
obtained in United States courts against his based on the civil
liability provisions of the United States securities laws. 
Since all our assets will be located outside U.S. it may be
difficult for U.S. investors to collect a judgment against us. As
well, any judgment obtained in the United States against us may be
enforceable in the United States.

IF MR.
GALARZA, OUR PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR RESIGN OR DIE, WE WILL NOT HAVE
A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THAT COULD RESULT IN OUR OPERATIONS
SUSPENDING. IF THAT SHOULD OCCUR, YOU COULD LOSE YOUR
INVESTMENT.

We
extremely depend on the services of our president and director,
Jose Galarza, for the future success of our business. The loss of
the services of Mr. Galarza could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. If he
should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer. If
that should occur, until we find another person to act as our chief
executive officer, our operations could be suspended. In that event
it is possible you could lose your entire investment. 

 




12




 

 

  

 

 
   

HAVING
ONLY ONE DIRECTOR LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE
INDEPENDENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROCEDURES AND INCREASES THE
CONTROL OF OUR PRESIDENT OVER OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS
DECISIONS.

We have
only one director, who is our principal executive officer.
Accordingly, we cannot establish board committees comprised of
independent members to oversee functions like compensation or audit
issues. In addition, a tie vote of board members is decided in
favor of the chairman, which gives his significant control over all
corporate issues, including all major decisions on operations and
corporate matters such as approving business
combinations.

Until we
have a larger board of directors that would include some
independent members, if ever, there will be limited oversight of
our president’s decisions and activities and little ability
for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities
and decisions, even if they are not in the best interests of
minority shareholders.

AS AN
“EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY” UNDER THE JOBS ACT, WE ARE
PERMITTED TO RELY ON EXEMPTIONS FROM CERTAIN DISCLOSURE
REQUIREMENTS.

We
qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS
Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on
exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we
are an emerging growth company, we will not be required
to:

•        
Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act;

•        
Provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s
report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting;

•        
Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm
rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing
additional information about the audit and the financial statements
(i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);

•        
Submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder
advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and-
“say-on-frequency;” and

•        
Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the
correlation between executive compensation and performance and
comparisons of the Chief Executive’s compensation to median
employee compensation.

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In
other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of
the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial
statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We will
remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five
years, or until the earliest of (i) the
last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross
revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a
“large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the
market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most
recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which
we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during
the preceding three year period. Even if we no longer qualify for
the exemptions for an emerging growth company, we may still be, in
certain circumstances, subject to scaled disclosure requirements as
a smaller reporting company. For example, smaller reporting
companies, like emerging growth companies, are not required to
provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of
Regulation S-K or auditor attestation of internal controls over
financial reporting. 

 




13




 

 

  

 

 
   

Until such
time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common
stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If
some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result,
there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and
our stock price may be more volatile.

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING

SINCE
THERE IS NO MINIMUM FOR OUR OFFERING, IF ONLY A FEW PERSONS
PURCHASE SHARES THEY WILL LOSE THEIR MONEY IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT US
BEING EVEN ABLE TO DEVELOP A MARKET FOR OUR SHARES.

Since
there is no minimum with respect to the number of shares to be sold
directly by the company in its offering, if only a few shares are
sold, we will be unable to even attempt to create a public market
of any kind for our shares. In such an event, it is highly likely
that the entire investment of the early and only share purchasers
would be lost immediately.

YOU MAY
NOT REVOKE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT ONCE IT IS ACCEPTED BY THE
COMPANY OR RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FUNDS ADVANCED IN CONNECTION
WITH YOUR ACCEPTED SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT AND AS A RESULT, YOU MAY
LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON
STOCK.

Once your
subscription agreement is accepted by the company, you may not
revoke the agreement or request a refund of any monies paid in
connection with the subscription agreement, even if you
subsequently learn information about the company that you consider
to be materially unfavorable. The company reserves the right to
begin using the proceeds from this offering as soon as the funds
have been received and will retain broad discretion in the
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. The precise
amounts and timing of the company's use of the net proceeds will
depend upon market conditions and the availability of other funds,
among other factors. Additionally, you may be unable to sell your
shares of our common stock at a price equal to or greater than the
subscription price you paid for such shares, and you may lose all
or part of your investment in our common stock.

OUR
PRESIDENT, MR. GALARZA DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFRERING
AND SELLING SECURITIES, AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MINIMUM
AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO
COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR
ENTIRE INVESTMENT. 

 




14




 

 

  

 

 
   

Mr.
Galarza does not have any experience conducting a securities
offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds
successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a
minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient
funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and
our business will suffer and your investment may be materially
adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a
best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire
investment in us.

BECAUSE
THE COMPANY HAS ARBITRARILY SET THE OFFERING PRICE, YOU MAY NOT
REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR
SHARES.

The
offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the
company’s shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and
do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any
other objective criteria of value. Additionally, as the company was
formed on July 20, 2016 and has no operating history and no
revenues as of August 31, 2016, the price of the offered shares is
not based on its past earnings and no investment banker, appraiser
or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the
offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price
used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to
receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of
common stock.

To the
date of this filing, November 14, 2016 our company Kalmin Corp. has
generated limited revenues of $4,300 from selling our kalabases and
bombillas to our first customer Tienda Calabaza Mate the sales
contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration
statement.

WE ARE
SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO
SELL ANY SHARES.

This
offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage
the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to
sell our shares through our President, who will receive no
commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any
of the shares. Unless he is successful in selling at least 25% of
the shares and we receive the proceeds in the amount of $15,000
from this offering.

ANY
ADDITIONAL FUNDING, WE ARRANGE THROUGH THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
IN THE FUTURE WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO PURCHASERS OF SECURITIES
IN THIS OFFERING.

We are a
development stage company and have generated no revenue as of
August 31, 2016. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate
amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The
exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development
and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and
we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and
expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term
financing. Our most likely sources of additional capital will be
through the sale of additional shares of common stock and through
selling our kalabases. The stock issuances
will cause interests of purchasers of securities in this offering
to be diluted. Such dilution will negatively affect the value of
investors’ shares. 

 




15




 

 

  

 

 
   

THE
TRADING IN OUR SHARES WILL BE REGULATED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULE 15G - 9 WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DEFINITION
OF A “PENNY STOCK.”

The
shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), and rules of the Commission. The
Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional
sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who
sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited
investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of
$5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or
annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or
in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For
transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must
make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions,
including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and
offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the
broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain
disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny
stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you
may purchase, if at all.

DUE TO
THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE
DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS
OFFERING.

We are
not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is
presently no demand for our common stock and no public market
exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to
contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the
offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over the
Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”). The OTCBB is a
regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last
sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities.
The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange.
Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be
eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in
their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If
we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting
obligations, we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC
Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation
of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement.
Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in
their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60-day
grace period if they do not make their required filing during that
time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or
approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date
of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings
between Kalmin Corp. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any
market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for
our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common
stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase
in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable
to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your
shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we
fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market,
your common stock will not have a quantifiable value
and it may
be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares,
resulting in an inability to realize any value from your
investment.

WE WILL
INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE.
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN
COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES,
IF AT ALL.

The
estimated cost of this registration statement is $7,000. We will
have to utilize funds from Jose Galarza, our sole officer and
director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to
complete the registration process. After the effective date of this
prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and
current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by
the Securities Exchange Act. We plan to contact a market maker
immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have
the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be
eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their
filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we
will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings,
which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash
resources. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to
remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any
shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay
the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not
be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin
Board.

WE MAY BE
EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL RISKS AND SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES RESULTING FROM
THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF
2002.

We will
be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, to include in our annual report our assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We
expect to incur significant continuing costs, including accounting
fees and staffing costs, in order to maintain compliance with the
internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Development of our business will necessitate on going changes to
our internal control systems, processes and information systems. If
our business develops and grows, our current design for internal
control over financial reporting will not be sufficient to enable
management to determine that our internal controls are effective
for any period, or on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, as we develop
our business, such development and growth will necessitate changes
to our internal control systems, processes and information systems,
all of which will require additional costs and expenses. In the
future, if we fail to complete the annual Section 404 evaluation in
a timely manner, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a
loss of public confidence in our internal controls. In addition,
any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or
difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our
operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations. However, as an “emerging growth company,”
as defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public
accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 until the
later of the year following our first annual report required to be
filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an emerging growth
company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting
firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event
it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are
documented, designed or operating.

UNITED
STATES STATE SECURITIES LAWS MAY LIMIT SECONDARY TRADING, WHICH MAY
RESTRICT THE STATES IN WHICH AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH YOU CAN
SELL THE SHARES OFFERED BY THIS PROSPECTUS.

There is
no public market for our securities, and there can be no assurance
that any public market will develop in the foreseeable future.
Secondary trading in securities sold in this offering will not be
possible in any state in the U.S. unless and until the common
shares are qualified for sale under the applicable securities laws
of the state or there is confirmation that an exemption, such as
listing in certain recognized securities manuals, is available for
secondary trading in such state. There can be no assurance that we
will be successful in registering or qualifying our securities for
secondary trading, or identifying an available exemption for
secondary trading in our securities in every state. If we fail to
register or qualify, or to obtain or verify an exemption for the
secondary trading of, the securities in any particular state, the
securities could not be offered or sold to, or purchased by, a
resident of that state.  In the event that a significant
number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our
securities, the market for our securities could be adversely
affected.

BECAUSE
WE ARE A “SHELL COMPANY”, THE HOLDERS OF OUR RESTRICTED
SECURITIES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES IN RELIANCE ON
RULE 144, UNTIL WE CEASE BEING A “SHELL
COMPANY”.

We are a
“shell company” as the applicable federal securities
law defines that term. Specifically, because of the nature and
amount of our assets, our limited operations history and limited
revenues pursuant to applicable federal rules, we are considered a
“shell company”. Applicable provisions of Rule 144
specify that during that time that we are a “shell
company” holders of our restricted securities cannot sell
those securities in reliance on Rule 144. Another implication of us
being a “shell company” is that we cannot file
registration statements under Section 5 of the Securities Act using
a Form S-8, a short form of registration to register securities
issued to employees and consultants under an employee benefit plan.
For us, to cease being a “shell company”, we must have
more than nominal operations and more that nominal assets or assets
which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents. 

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS

This
prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk
and uncertainties. We use words such as “anticipate”,
“believe”, “plan”, “expect”,
“future”, “intend”, and similar expressions
to identify such forward- looking statements. Investors should be
aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this
filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of
this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons,
including the risks faced by us as described in the “Risk
Factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus.

* SEC
reporting and compliance costs will be approximately $7,000.
Therefore, in the scenario of selling 25% of the maximum offering
amount, after paying offering expenses SEC reporting and compliance
we will have a $1,000 and will be able to use them. If we need
additional funds to meet the SEC reporting and compliance
obligations Jose Galarza, our director, has verbally agreed to loan
the company funds to complete the registration process.

The above
figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Jose Galarza,
our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the company
funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would
be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting
status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and
if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Galarza will not be paid any
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There
is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr.
Galarza. Mr. Galarza will be repaid from revenues of operations if
and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.

To the
date of this filing, November 14, 2016 our company Kalmin Corp. has
generated limited revenues of $4,300 from selling our kalabases and
bombillas to our first customer Tienda Calabaza Mate the sales
contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration
statement.

DETERMINATION
OF OFFERING PRICE

We have
determined the offering price of the shares arbitrarily. The price
does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings,
or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company.
In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering
price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount
of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly,
the offering price should not be considered an indication of the
actual value of the securities. 

DILUTION

The price
of the current offering is fixed at $0.02 per share. This price is
significantly higher than the price paid by the company’s
officer for common equity since the company’s inception on
July 20, 2016. Jose Galarza, the company’s sole officer and
director, paid $0.001 per share for the 4,000,000 shares of common
stock he purchased from the company on August 23, 2016.

Dilution
represents the difference between the offering price and the net
tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this
offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from
subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total
assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary
determination of the offering price of the shares being offered.
Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result
of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing
stockholders. The following sections compare the differences
between our future investor’s investment in our shares and
the investment of our existing stockholders.

As of
August 31, 2016, the net tangible book value of our shares of
common stock was $1,768 or approximately $0.0004 per
share.

If 100%
of the Shares Are Sold:

Upon
completion of this offering, in the event all of the shares are
sold, the net tangible book value of the 7,000,000 shares to be
outstanding will be $54,768 or approximately $0.0078 per share. The
net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0.0004.
The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing
stockholders will be increased by $0.0074 per share without any
additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will
incur an immediate dilution from $0.02 per share to $0.0126 per
share.

After
completion of this offering, if 3,000,000 shares are sold,
investors in the offering will own 42.86% of the total number of
shares then outstanding for which they will have made cash
investment of $60,000, or $0.02 per share. Our existing stockholder
will own 57.14% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for
which he has made contributions of cash totaling $4,000 or $0.001
per share.

If 75% of
the Shares Are Sold

Upon
completion of this offering, in the event 2,250,000 shares are
sold, the net tangible book value of the 6,250,000 shares to be
outstanding will be $39,768, or approximately $0.0064 per share.
The net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is
$0.0004. The net tangible book value of the shares held by our
existing stockholders will be increased by $0.006 per share without
any additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering
will incur an immediate dilution from $0.02 per share to $0.014 per
share.

After
completion of this offering investors in the offering will own
approximately 36% of the total number of shares then outstanding
for which they will have made cash investment of $2,250,000, or
$0.02 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately
64% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he
has made contributions of cash totaling $4,000 or $0.001 per
share.

If 50% of
the Shares Are Sold

Upon
completion of this offering, in the event 1,500,000 shares are
sold, the net tangible book value of the 5,500,000 shares to be
outstanding will be $24,768 or approximately $0.0045 per share. The
net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0.0004.
The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing
stockholders will be increased by $0.0041 per share without any
additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will
incur an immediate dilution from $0.02 per share to $0.0159per
share.

After
completion of this offering investors in the offering will own
approximately 27.27% of the total number of shares then outstanding
for which they will have made cash investment of $1,500,000, or
$0.02 per share. Our existing stockholder will own approximately
72.73% of the total number of shares then outstanding, for which he
has made contributions of cash totaling $4,000 or $0.001 per
share.

If 25% of
the Shares Are Sold

Upon
completion of this offering, in the event 750,000 shares are sold,
the net tangible book value of the 4,750,000 shares to be
outstanding will be $9,768 or approximately $0.0021 per share. The
net tangible book value per share prior to the offering is $0.0004.
The net tangible book value of the shares held by our existing
stockholders will be increased by $0.0017 per share without any
additional investment on their part. Investors in the offering will
incur an immediate dilution from $0.02 per share to $0.0183 per
share.

After
completion of these offering investors in the offering will own
15.79% of the total number of shares then outstanding for which
they will have made cash investment of $750,000, or $0.02 per
share. Our existing stockholder will own 84.21% of the total number
of shares then outstanding, for which he has made contributions of
cash totaling $4,000 or $0.001 per share.

following table compares the differences of your investment in our
shares with the investment of our existing stockholders.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations together with our consolidated
financial statements and the related notes and other financial
information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the
information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth
elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to
our plans and strategy for our business and related financing,
includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. You should review the “Risk Factors”
section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements
contained in the following discussion and analysis.

We
qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS
Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on
exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we
are an emerging growth company, we will not be required
to:

•        
Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act;

•        
Provide an auditor attestation with respect to management’s
report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting;

•        
Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm
rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing
additional information about the audit and the financial statements
(i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);

•        
Submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder
advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and
“say-on-frequency;” and

•        
Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the
correlation between executive compensation and performance and
comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee
compensation.

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In
other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of
the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial
statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting
standards.

We will
remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five
years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1
billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated
filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary
shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of
the last business day of our most recently completed second
fiscal quarter or
(iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in
non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. Even
if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth
company, we may still be, in certain circumstances, subject to
scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company. For
example, smaller reporting companies, like emerging growth
companies, are not required to provide a compensation discussion
and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K or auditor
attestation of internal controls over financial reporting.

We are a
development stage company. Our full business plan entails
activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long
term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering
may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding
will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. Our
expansion may include expanding our office facilities, hiring sales
personnel and entering into agreements with new clients. We have
not planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale
of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding
needed for our long term financing.

Our
independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern
opinion. This means that there is a doubt that we can continue as
an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have
generated no revenues as of August 31, 2016.

To the
date of this filing, November 14, 2016 our company Kalmin Corp. has
generated limited revenues of $4,300 from selling our kalabases and
bombillas to our first customer Tienda Calabaza Mate the sales
contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration
statement.

To meet
our needs for cash we are attempting to raise money from this
offering and from selling our kalabases. We believe that we will be
able to raise enough money through this offering or through selling
our products to continue our proposed operations but we cannot
guarantee that once we continue operations we will stay in business
after doing so. If we are unable to successfully find customers, we
may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to
find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any
arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this
offering. As of August 31, 2016 we have signed sales contract, and
we believe that we might get a production order for this customer
in the nearest time.

If we
need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to
suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations
entirely. Even if we raise $60,000 from this offering, it will last
one year, but we may need more funds for business operations in the
next year, and we will have to revert to obtaining additional
money.

PLAN OF
OPERATION

We intend
to commence operations in the business of kalabas cups production.
Our business is creating kalabases for drinking mate tea. We have
not generated any revenues as of August 31, 2016. We have created
our business plan, set up our website
and we have purchased our 3D Milling machine and raw materials. Now
we are developing models of our business cards.

To the
date of this filing, November 14, 2016 our company Kalmin Corp. has
generated limited revenues of $4,300 from selling our kalabases and
bombillas to our first customer Tienda Calabaza Mate the sales
contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration
statement.

Our cash
balance as of August 31, 2016 will not be sufficient to fund our
operations for the next twelve months, if we are unable to
successfully raise money in this offering. However, if we sell half
of the securities offered for sale by the company and raise the
gross proceeds of $15,000 will satisfy cash requirements for twelve
months and we will not be required to raise additional funds to
meet operating expenses, but our growth plan of operations will be
limited. If we sell more than quarter of the shares in this
offering, we provide funds for in accordance to our plan of
estimated expanses. If we need more money, we will have to revert
to obtaining additional financing by way of a private debt or
equity financing. We may also utilize funds from Mr. Galarza, our
sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance
funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees,
professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the
filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. There
is no maximum amount of funds that our President has agreed to
advance. Mr. Galarza, however, has no formal commitment,
arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the
company.

During
the first and second month after completion of this offering, we
will establish our office. During month 2nd -5th we will be
developing our marketing campaign and our website developing will
be from 1st to 3rd month also we believe that we will start to sell
our product more widely. Until this time, we do not believe that
our operations will be profitable. There is no assurance we will
ever reach that stage.

We will
not be conducting any product research or development. Further we
do not expect significant changes in the number of employees. Upon
completion of our public offering, our specific goal is profitably
selling kalabases.

After the
effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and
Exchange Commissions, we intend to concentrate our efforts on
raising capital. During this period, our operations will be limited
due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our
public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell kalabases
cups. Our plan of operations following the completion is as
follows:

Establish
our Office

Time
Frame: 1st - 2nd months. Material costs:
$2,000-$5,000.

Upon
completion of the offering we plan to set up an office in Asuncion,
Paraguay, and acquire the necessary equipment to continue
operations. We plan to purchase office equipment such as telephone,
fax, office supplies and furniture. Our sole officer and director,
Jose Galarza will provide his own laptop for the office and will
take care of our initial administrative duties. We believe that it
will cost at least $600 to set up office and obtain the necessary
equipment and stationery to continue operations. If we sell only
25% of our shares, our director will allocate the necessary
funds for
the resettlement office and early costs. In the event of selling
50% of the shares we would buy new modern computer and better
software for our business. In this case, set up costs will be
approximately $2,000 and modern 3D Milling Machine will cost
$3,500. If we sell 75% of the shares offered, we will buy better
equipment with advanced features such as another modern computer
for our work for two milling machines, it will be cost $4,000 and
cost for the equipment will be $7,000. In the event we sell all of
the shares offered we will buy additional and more advanced
equipment that will help us in everyday production and also big
screen TV for the purpose of showing the samples of our kalabases
with different individual engraving and it will be glass showcase
with our products, therefore the office set up costs will be
approximately $5,000 and cost for the four 3D Milling Machines will
be $14,000.

Develop
Our Website

Time
Frame: 1st – 3rd months. Material costs:
$1,500-$4,500.

If we
only sell 25% of shares, we are not going to spend additional money
on developing and evolving our website.

During
this period, we intend to begin developing our website. Our sole
officer and director, Jose Galarza will be in charge of all website
activities.  We registered domain name for our website
www.kalmincorp.com and fill it with general information about the
company and production process. Further we plan to attract a web
designer to help us with the designing and developing our website.
We do not have any written agreements with any of web designers at
current time. The website development costs, including site
designing and implementation will be approximately $1,500 in the
event of selling 50% of the shares. If we sell 75% of the shares
offered or all of the shares offered we would develop more
sophisticated and well-designed web site with online-shop,
therefore developing cost will be $3,500 and $4,500 accordingly.
Updating and improving our website will continue throughout the
lifetime of our operations.

Marketing

Time
Frame: 2nd - 5th months. Material costs:
$300-$6,000.

We expect
to have the website fully complete and operational in both English
and Spanish. We intend to use marketing tools, such as web
advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire
potential customers. When we complete our website and it is fully
operational we will begin to market our website using the following
online social media avenues:

•        
Facebook,

•        
Twitter,

•        
Instagram,

•        
Google AdWords,

•        
Blogging.

If we will
sell 25% of shares, we can spend just a $300 for creating a simple
landing page and some billboard advertisement.

We will
develop our client base by focusing our marketing efforts on
kalabases with individual engraving production. We will compete
with other distributors for positioning of our products in retail
space. We also plan to attend trade shows in our industry such as
tea festivals, exhibition of handmade utensil and cups and others
to showcase our product with a view to find new customers. We
believe that we should begin to see results from our marketing
campaign within 120 days from its initiation. We intend to spend
from $300 to $6,000 on marketing efforts during the first year,
which depend on the amount of sold shares. Marketing is an ongoing
matter that will continue during the life of our
operations.

If we do
not raise at least $30,000 in this offering, we must limit our
marketing activities and may not be able to make our product known
to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing
activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to
operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, our operations
will be harmed.

Negotiations
with potential customers

Time
Frame: 3rd -12th months. No material costs.

We plan
to put in our marketing plan and start negotiation with potential
customers. We plan to enter the market in a way of offering our
products to the potential customers such as online resources of
mate tea and tea kiosks in our city location and might signed
agreements with them. We will negotiate terms and conditions of
collaboration. This activity will be ongoing throughout our
operations. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of
customers and agreements with them in the end of the twelve
months’ period, there is no guarantee that we will be able to
attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our
expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of
revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks,
then it would materially affect our financial condition and our
business could be harmed.

Hire a
sales and assistant person

Time
Frame: 6th - 12th months. Material costs:
$1,500-$3,500.

In
general, our machine needs only one person to operate, it is very
simply constructed and does not require special knowledge and
skills, so our sole director and officer can execute these
operations by himself, but further in the event of selling all of
shares of this offering we are planning to hire an assistant for
our sole director and officer Jose Galarza for the supporting in
operating of 3D Milling Machine.

If we
sell at least half of shares in this offering, we intend to hire
one salesperson with good knowledge and connections in our market
area that will execute duties for two days a week. The salary of
the sales person in this case will be $1,500 per year. The
salesperson’s responsibilities will be finding potential
purchasers, introduce our products and negotiate with them
regarding all related questions. If we sell 75% of shares in this
offering, we intend to hire sales person for a half working day
and assistant
of our director and the salary will be $2,500 per year. The
negotiation of additional agreements with potential customers will
be ongoing during the life of our operations. In the event of
selling all of the shares our sales person will work a half-day and
assistant of our sole director and officer will work also half
working day. For such work our future employee might have $3,500
salary. 

 




29




 

 

  

 

 
   

In
summary, during 1st-2nd month’ we should establish our office
and till 3rd month fully develop our website. After this point we
should be ready to start more significant operations and start
selling our products. During 2nd-5th month we will be developing
our marketing campaign. Further we are planning to negotiate with
the potential customers and hiring sales person and assistant for
our sole director and officer accordingly to the plan described
above in accordance to sold shares from this offering. Our
miscellaneous expenses include replacement consumables and major
spare parts for our machines, as well as oil and other small
replacement parts. The cost for such service will be from $2,000-
$4,000. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in
the first twelve months after completion our offering or ever
generate any revenue.

Jose
Galarza, our president and director will be devoting 75% of his
time for planning and organizing activities for Kalmin Corp. Once
we expand operations, and are able to attract more and more
customers to buy our products, Mr. Galarza has informally agreed to
commit more time as required. After one year we may need additional
financing and our director agreed to allocate funds if it will be
necessary.

The
various offering amounts presented in the table above are for
illustrative purposes only.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have
no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

LIMITED
OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

There is
no historical financial information about us upon which to base an
evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations
and do not have revenues as of August 31, 2016. We cannot guarantee
we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is
subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business
enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services and
products.

To the
date of this filing, November 14, 2016 our company Kalmin Corp. has
generated limited revenues of $4,300 from selling our kalabases and
bombillas to our first customer Tienda Calabaza Mate the sales
contract with who is filed as an exhibit to this registration
statement.

We have
no assurance that future financing will be available to us on
acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory
terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our
operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to
existing shareholder.

RESULTS
OF OPERATION

From
Inception on July 20, 2016 to August 31, 2016

During
the period we have formed the company, developed our business plan,
set up our web site, signed lease agreement and we have purchased
our milling machine and raw materials. Our loss since inception is
$2,232. We have not meaningfully commenced our proposed business
operations as of August 31, 2016.

Since
inception, we have sold 4,000,000 shares of common stock to our
sole officer and director Jose Galarza for net proceeds of $4,000.


LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We are
attempting to raise funds to start with our plan of operation. We
will have to utilize funds from Jose Galarza, our sole officer and
director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to
complete the registration process. However, Mr. Galarza has no
formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or
loan funds to the company. To start with our operations within
twelve months, we need a minimum of $15,000. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to sell all the shares
required to satisfy our 12 months’ financial requirement. If
we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items
set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We
will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to
proceed with our plan of operation. In a long term we may need
additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for
additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject
to a number of factors, including general market conditions,
investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from
our business operations. These factors may impact the timing,
amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to
us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be
available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.

Our
auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion, meaning
that there is a doubt if we want to start and continue as an
on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until
we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented
our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is
investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to
implement our business plan and stay in business. The amount of the
offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and
have the capital resources required to cover the material costs
with becoming a publicly reporting.

Our funds
on hand will only provide us with the ability to pay for the
expenses related to this Offering. Currently we do not have
sufficient capital to fund our business development. Per the Use of
Proceeds section, we are attempting to raise $60,000, from this
Offering.  However, if we raise $45,000 or $30,000, we feel
this is sufficient to develop the business for the next twelve
months.  If we are only able to raise $15,000, from this
offering, then we feel this will be sufficient for the next twelve
months to cover professional fees and minimal business development.
Even if we have enough funds for first year, it does not mean that
we do not require additional investment to continue our
production.

About Mate
tea.

We
suppose that mate tea is one of the most useful drinks in the
world. That requires special equipment for use, such as Kalabas and
Bombilla. Nowadays mate is acquiring more and more fans.

Official
research scientists say that mate tea contains practically all the
vitamins and substances necessary for the maintenance of normal
human life. There is resin fiber, volatile oil, tannin, which is
found in many plant substances. Besides - carotene, group A, C, E,
B1, B2 vitamins, vitamin B-complex group in a higher concentration
than the well-known honey bees’ uterus, riboflavin, niacin,
pantothenic acid, biotin, magnesium, calcium, iron, sodium,
potassium, manganese, silicon, phosphate, sulfur, hydrochloric
acid, chlorophyll, choline, inositol. In its conclusions, the
scientists pointed out that a plant with so many essential and
vital nutrients - extremely rare in nature. 1

About our
Kalabas and Bombilla.

We will
produce kalabas for drinking mate tea. There are many options for
the production and we choose to use wood. Kalabas (calabash) is a
traditional vessel for drinking yerba mate. In ancient times,
Indians kalabas was manufactured from wood gourd. Later, they began
to produce vessels of wood, fret, iron framing. The second
mandatory attribute is Bombilla. Bombilla previously made of thin
hollow trunks of plants. Today it is a whole industry; they are
made of metal (stainless steel), silver. The top of the tube is
slightly flat mouthpiece, which may be gold-plated or silver, and
at the bottom - with a special filter. Bombilla may be straight or
slightly curved.

In the
future we plan to expand the production and purchase more machines.
We are planning to rent a bigger office when are operations are
expanded and we attact more customers.

Product

We are
going to produce main necessary equipment for drinking mate, which
are kalabas and bombilla. We start with the cups of the same size
and will expand the range of kalabases in the future. Aluminum and
wood are used as raw materials for our production. These materials
will last longer, and it has become more popular than the pumpkin,
which often cracks. At the end with a special 3D Milling machine we
will give the original look and engraved patterns to our
product.

In
addition we will order the tubes, the Bombilla itself. There are
examples of the items:

The cost

computer with LPT-port and installed Windows operating system. In
this case our director will use his own computer, until we
generated significant revenues or proceeds from this offering to
but a computer for the Company’s needs.

Raw
Materials

For
reliability and durability, we are going to use wood and aluminum
in the production of kalabases. We believe that this material will
last longer, and it has become more popular than the pumpkin, which
often cracks and use to be a mail material for kalabases
manufacturing. Therefore, we will use wood and aluminum in our
operations.

Target
market

Mate tea
is becoming more and more popular in the world. Scientists’
research about which we wrote above only develops the popularity of
this tea. This trend is worldwide.

Kalmin
Corp. intends to create high-quality and durable product for anyone
who wants to take care of their health and drink healthy
drinks.

Industry
analysis and competition

Many
companies in this sector have begun to experiment with the material
for production. Some are making kalabas even silicone now. We chose
the path of the most useful and reliable material such as wood. For
example to compare with pumpkin from which the initial production
of kalabas was started from, wood leaves its taste and smell as
well as a more durable and long lasting.

Our
company will make special beautiful patterns on our kalabas with
our 3D Milling machine. We can make individual and unique engraving
on our product. Kalmin Corp. will give the originality and beauty
to the manufactured products that will release us from the
crowd.

Markets

We
believe that our product is popular around the world. We will be
able to cooperate with shops tea and tea accessories worldwide,
when our business is successfully developed. Kalmin Corp. will
collaborate with online stores and specialized sites on the subject
of mate tea around in Paraguay first and then in the closest
neighborhood countries..

As of the
dated of this filing we started our production in Caacupe, and
fulfilled two initial orders of our products for our first
customer, contract with this customer is filed as exhibit to this
registration statement.

Marketing

To
promote our products, we need a website and cooperation with other
specialized sites and online stores. As well as possible local
advertising like billboards, search for local buyers. We will
search both ways of selling our products at the same time, it will
be wholesale and retail sale of kalabases and bombillas.

We are
planning to affix every product, including those distributed via
retail points, with a business card with information about Kalmin
Corp., information about the product and contact details. In orders
to enhance the feeling of uniqueness of our products, we may
