Harvest Capital Credit: ~10% Yielding Monthly Payer, But Coverage Is Weak - Harvest Capital Credit Corp. (NASDAQ:HCAP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Harvest Capital Credit: ~10% Yielding Monthly Payer, But Coverage Is WeakJul.23.17 | About: Harvest Capital (HCAP) Sure Dividend Long-term horizon, newsletter provider, dividend investing, High Quality DividendsMarketplaceUndervalued AristocratsWritten by Bob Ciura on July 21st, 2017, for Sure Dividend. Business Development Companies, or BDCs, are a popular investment class among income investors. BDCs pay dividend yields that far exceed the yields available from other asset classes. For example, the S&P 500 Index has a 2% dividend yield, on average. High-quality bonds aren’t much better—the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yields just 2.3% right now. Compare these puny yields with Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (NASDAQ:HCAP), a BDC with a dividend yield nearing 10%. Harvest is one of 405 stocks with a 5%+ dividend yield. Not only that, but Harvest pays its dividend each month, rather than each quarter like most companies.  Of course, just because a stock has an attractive high dividend yield does not automatically make it a good investment. Investors must evaluate the sustainability of a dividend payout, especially for such extreme high-yielding stocks. This article will discuss Harvest’s business model, and whether the dividend appears to be sustainable going forward. Business Overview Harvest makes investments in lower middle-market companies that are usually at an early stage in their growth cycles. It has a very large and diversified investment portfolio, across various industries. 

 Source: Investor Presentation, page 7 Harvest makes a variety of debt and equity investments, including senior secured debt, uni-tranche term loans, junior secured term loans, subordinated debt, and minority equity co-investments. It typically invests in companies with annual revenue of $10 million-$100 million. The vast majority (96%) of the company’s investments are in secured debt: 


 Source: Investor Presentation, page 8 Harvest ended 2016 with 31 investments in the portfolio, 28 of which were debt investments. The primary driver of Harvest’s profitability is investment income derived from its portfolio. Net investment income rose 3.9% last year, to $1.60 per share. This allows the company to make high levels of distributions to shareholders. Based on core net investment income, a non-GAAP measure which excludes certain non-recurring items, Harvest had a dividend coverage ratio of 119% last year. This means the company generated approximately 19% more net investment income than it needed to pay dividends to shareholders in 2016. Harvest’s other financial performance metrics were a mixed bag last year. Net asset value declined 2.8% in 2016, to $13.86, due to lower portfolio assets and share issuances throughout the year. Harvests’ debt investments generate high returns. The company ended 2016 with a weighted average yield of 15.2% in the debt investment portfolio. Going forward, Harvest’s debt portfolio should continue to perform well, as rising interest rates could be a growth catalyst. Growth Prospects There are two major catalysts for Harvest’s future investment income growth. The first is growth in the portfolio. Increasing assets will allow the company to invest more, which would generate new income. The second growth catalyst is higher yields from existing assets. However, Harvest is off to a rough start to 2017. First-quarter new debt investment commitments declined 15% year over year. And the average yield of the company’s debt investments declined 40 basis points in the first quarter, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Because of higher shares outstanding, this drove a 15% decline in first-quarter net investment income per share. Net investment income of $0.35 per share for the first quarter barely covered Harvest’s quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. The dividend coverage ratio sunk to 103%, which is now barely sufficient coverage. Investors should closely monitor the company’s results in future quarters, as it does not have much room for error.
 One advantage for Harvest is rising interest rates, which should boost investment income growth. Harvest believes it has significant upside potential as interest rates rise. For example, management estimates that net investment income stands to increase by more than $560,000, or $0.09 per share, for every 100 basis-point move in LIBOR. Dividend Analysis Harvest currently pays a monthly dividend of $0.1125 per share. Annualized, the payout comes to $1.35 per share. Based on Harvest’s July 19 closing share price of $13.99, the stock has a dividend yield of approximately 10%. Fortunately, Harvest covered its dividend with net investment income last year. And, the credit quality of the portfolio remains strong. Harvest employs a proprietary ranking system to quantify its credit risk exposure. There are five levels of the system, based on how well the investments perform:  Investment Rating 1: Investments that are performing above expectations, whose risks remain favorable. Investment Rating 2: Investments that are performing within expectations, whose risks remain neutral. All new loans are given an initial level 2 rating. Investment Rating 3: Investments that are performing below expectations, and require closer evaluation. However, no losses are expected from this group. Investment Rating 4: Investments that are performing substantially below expectations, whose risks have increased substantially. Expectations are for some loss of return, but no loss of principal. Investment Rating 5: Investments that are performing substantially below expectations, whose risks have increased substantially. Some loss of both return and principal is expected.  This ranking system helps keep the company’s risks manageable. At the end of 2016, Harvest’s debt portfolio had a weighted average ranking of 2.01, up slightly from 1.97 the year before, but still representing a strong overall portfolio. To begin 2017, nine of Harvest’s 28 debt investments were ranked 1, 13 were ranked 2, three were ranked 3, 2 were ranked 4, and one was ranked 5.
 The company seems to have an appropriate balance between risk and return in its debt portfolio, which is a positive for the dividend. That said, there are a few potential red flags when it comes to Harvest’s dividend. First, it is a very small company. Harvest has a market capitalization of just $90 million, which makes it a micro-cap. Micro-caps tend to be more volatile, and do not have the financial resources of larger companies. This often makes their dividends less reliable than more established large-caps, particularly if the economy enters recession. Final Thoughts Stocks with double-digit yields are attractive, but are not for the faint of heart. With a nearly 10% dividend yield, Harvest has obvious appeal for income investors. But Harvest is not a stock that can be a part of a “set-it-and-forget-it” portfolio. Investors cannot simply buy Harvest shares and assume the dividend will be sustainable. The company is covering the dividend with sufficient investment income for now, and has growth potential from higher interest rates, but none of this is a guarantee. Harvest is an attractive dividend stock for its high dividend yield, but investors need to closely monitor the company’s results moving forward.

	as may be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the “





	Agreement


	”) dated as of October 29, 2013, is entered into by and among

	Borrower


	”), each of the financial institutions from time to time party hereto (individually each a “


	Lender


	” and collectively the “


	Lenders


	”) and

	PACIFIC WESTERN BANK

	(successor-by-merger to CapitalSource Bank), a California state-chartered bank (“


	Pacific Western


	”), as administrative, payment and collateral agent for itself, as a Lender and for the other Lenders (together with its successors and assigns in such capacities, “

	WHEREAS

	, Borrower has requested that Lenders make available to Borrower a revolving credit facility in a maximum principal amount of up to the Maximum Loan Amount, which, as of the Closing Date is Fifty-Five Million and No/100 Dollars $55,000,000, subject at all times to Availability, the proceeds of which shall be used by Borrower to provide Underlying Loans to Underlying Borrowers (the “


	Business


	”), to pay closing expenses related to the Loan, for payments to Agent and Lenders and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement;




	 





	WHEREAS

	, Borrower is willing to grant Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, a lien on and security interest in the Collateral to secure the Loan and other financial accommodations being granted by Lenders to Borrower; and




	 





	WHEREAS

	, Lenders are willing to make the Loan available to Borrower upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.




	 





	NOW, THEREFORE

	, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which hereby are acknowledged, Borrower, Agent and Lenders hereby agree as follows:




	 





	I.     DEFINITIONS





	 





	1.1     General Terms





	 




	For purposes of the Loan Documents and all Annexes thereto, in addition to the definitions above and elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the terms listed in this

	Article I

	shall have the meanings given such terms in this

	Article I

	(and such meanings shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural form of the terms defined, as the context may require). All capitalized terms used which are not specifically defined shall have the meanings provided in

	Article 9

	of the UCC in effect on the date hereof to the extent the same are used or defined therein. Unless otherwise specified, references in this Agreement or any of the appendices to a Section, subsection, or clause refer to such Section, subsection, or clause as contained in this Agreement. The words “herein,” “hereof” and “hereunder” and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all Annexes, as the same may from time to time be amended, restated, modified, or supplemented, and not to any particular section, subsection or clause contained in this Agreement or any such Annex. Any term which is defined by reference to any agreement, instrument, or document shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in such other agreement, instrument, or document as amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time and, in each case such meaning shall not be affected if any such document is terminated. Wherever from the context it appears appropriate, each term stated in either the singular or plural shall include the singular and the plural and pronouns stated in the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall include the masculine, feminine, and neuter genders. The words “including”, “includes”, and “include” shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”; the word “or” is not exclusive; references to Persons include their respective successors and assigns (to the extent and only to the extent permitted by the Loan Documents) or, in the case of governmental Persons, Persons succeeding to the relevant functions of such Persons; and all references to statutes and related regulations shall include any amendments of the same and any successor statutes and regulations. Whenever any provision in any Loan Document refers to the knowledge (or an analogous phrase) of any Person, such words are intended to signify that such Person has actual knowledge or awareness of a particular fact or circumstance or that such Person, if it had exercised reasonable diligence, would have known or been aware of such fact or circumstance. Unless otherwise specified herein, this Agreement and any agreement or contract referred to herein shall mean such agreement as modified, amended or supplemented from time to time. Unless otherwise specified, as used in the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, instrument or other document made or delivered pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, all accounting terms not defined in this

	Article I

	or elsewhere in this Agreement shall have the meanings given to such terms in and shall be interpreted in accordance with GAAP.

	“

	Adjusted Principal Balance

	” shall mean, with respect to any Pledged Loan as of any date of determination, the outstanding principal amount of such Pledged Loan as of such date;

	provided

	,

	however

	,


	that



	the Adjusted Principal Balance of any Pledged Loan that defers or capitalizes interest shall exclude such deferred or capitalized interest, and the Adjusted Principal Balance shall exclude any protective advances made in respect of such Pledged Loan.





	 




	“

	Administration Agreement

	” shall mean that certain Administration Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2013, by and among Administrator and Harvest, as such may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof.

	provided

	, that (i) the Advances of such Lender at any time outstanding under the Loan shall not exceed an amount equal to such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the lesser of (such aggregate amount as applicable to all Lenders being referred to herein as “

	(ii)     The entries made in the electronic or written records maintained pursuant to

	subsection (i)

	of this

	Section 2.1(a)

	(the “

	prima facie

	evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations and Indebtedness therein recorded;

	provided

	,

	however

	(iii)     Agent will account to Borrower monthly with a written statement of the Advances under the Loan, and any charges and payments made pursuant to this Agreement,

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the failure of Agent to provide such written statement shall not constitute a default or breach by Agent or any Lender of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and in the absence of manifest error, such accounting rendered by Agent shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive unless Agent is notified by Borrower in writing to the contrary within sixty (60) Business Days of Receipt of each accounting, which notice shall be deemed an objection only to items specifically objected to therein.




	 




	(b)     

	Notes

	. Borrower agrees that:




	 




	(i)     upon written request by any Lender to Borrower for a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is requested by Agent for the benefit of all or any Lender to evidence the Loan and other Obligations owing or payable to, or to be made by such Lender, Borrower shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of any such request) execute and deliver to such Lender an appropriate promissory note or notes substantially in the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit D

	;




	 




	(ii)     all references to Note or Notes in the Loan Documents shall mean the Note or Notes, if any, to the extent issued (and not returned to Borrower for cancellation) hereunder, as the same may be amended, modified, divided, supplemented and/or restated from time to time;




	 




	 




	 


	39




	 




	 




	(iii)     upon written request by any Lender, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of any such request, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender new Notes (on substantially the same terms and in substantially the same form) and/or divide the Notes in exchange for then existing Notes in such smaller amounts or denominations as Agent shall specify in its sole discretion;

	provided




	,



	that the aggregate principal amount of such new Notes shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding at the time such request is made; and

	provided

	,

	further

	, that such Notes that are to be replaced shall then be deemed no longer outstanding hereunder and replaced by such new Notes and returned to Borrower within ten (10) days after Agent’s receipt of the replacement Notes; and




	 




	(iv)     upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to Borrower of the mutilation, destruction, loss or theft of any Notes and the ownership thereof, Borrower shall, upon the written request of the holder of such Notes, execute and deliver in replacement thereof new Notes in the same form, in the same original principal amount and dated the same date as the Notes so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen; and such Notes so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen shall then be deemed no longer outstanding hereunder. If the Notes being replaced have been mutilated, they shall be surrendered to Borrower after delivery of the replacement Notes.




	 




	(c)     

	Payment at Maturity Date

	. All amounts outstanding under the Loan and all other Obligations under the Loan shall be due and payable by Borrower in full, if not earlier in accordance with this Agreement, on the Maturity Date.




	 





	2.2     Interest on the Loan





	 




	(a)     Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the outstanding principal amount of the Loan, monthly in arrears to Agent for the account of Lenders, from the date the proceeds thereof are made available to the Borrower until paid, at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the LIBOR Rate, plus four and one-half of one percent (4.50%) per annum (such rate, the “


	Calculated Rate


	”) and (ii) the Maximum Rate. All such payments of interest shall be made on each Payment Date for the immediately preceding calendar month in accordance with

	Section 2.5

	. If Lenders are prevented from charging or collecting interest at the Calculated Rate, then the interest rate shall continue to be the Maximum Rate until such time as Lenders have charged and collected the full amount of interest that would be chargeable and collectable if interest at the Calculated Rate had always been lawfully chargeable and collectible.




	 




	(b)     Borrower shall be permitted to request that the LIBOR Rate for any calendar month be based on the offered rate for loans in United States dollars for either a one (1) month or three (3) month period upon a written request to Agent received no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the start of such calendar month. Absent any written request by Borrower, the LIBOR Rate shall be deemed to be based on the offered rate for loans in United States dollars for a one (1) month period.


	To the extent Borrower chooses (or is deemed to choose) the LIBOR Rate to be based on the offered rate for loans in United States dollars for a one (1) month period, the applicable LIBOR Rate with respect to such one (1) month period shall be determined by Agent on the first Business Day of such month and shall be the same throughout such month and (

	y

	) to the extent Borrower chooses the LIBOR Rate to be based on the offered rate for loans in United States dollars for a three (3) month period, the applicable LIBOR Rate shall be determined by Agent on the first Business Day of the first month of such period and shall be the same throughout such period. The monthly interest due on the principal balance of the Loan outstanding shall be computed for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days and shall be calculated by determining the average daily principal balance of the Obligations outstanding for each day of the calendar month in question.

	2.3     Loan Disbursements; Requirement to Deliver Borrowing Certificate





	 




	At any time during the Revolving Period, so long as each of the conditions precedent contained in

	Section 4.2

	are satisfied (including, without limitation, the condition that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), Borrower may request an Advance under the Loan by delivering to Agent an irrevocable Request for Advance in the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit B

	Request for Advance


	”) (which may be delivered via e-mail attachment, so long as it is signed by a Responsible Officer) not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least two (2) Business Days before the proposed Business Day on which such requested Advance is to be made (each, a “

	are satisfied as of the date of such Borrowing Certificate (subject to the update of the Schedules hereto), together with calculations evidencing satisfaction of such conditions and (ii) as well as such other supporting documentation with respect to the figures and information in the Borrowing Certificate as Agent shall request in its sole discretion. On each Borrowing Date, Borrower irrevocably authorizes Agent and Lenders to disburse the proceeds of the requested Advance to the applicable account(s) of Borrower or as otherwise specified in the applicable Borrowing Certificate (which in each case shall be one or more of the accounts set forth on

	Schedule 5.18B

	), for credit to the account of Borrower (or to such other account as to which Borrower shall instruct Agent in writing) via Federal funds wire transfer.

	Blocked Account


	”), all Available Amounts in relation to any and all Pledged Loans and any other Collateral. In the event Borrower receives any payments on any Pledged Loan directly from or on behalf of the Underlying Borrower thereof, Borrower shall receive such payment in trust for the sole and exclusive benefit of Agent, and Borrower shall deliver it to the Administrator within two (2) Business Days (in the form so received), unless Agent shall have notified Borrower to deliver directly to Agent all payments in respect of the Pledged Loans which may be received by Borrower, in which event all such payments (in the form received) shall be endorsed by Borrower to Agent and delivered to Agent promptly upon Borrower’s receipt thereof. Within two (2) Business Days after deposit into the Deposit Account of any Available Amounts as set forth in clause (i) above, Borrower shall transfer all such Available Amounts payable to Borrower (as opposed to any other unaffiliated lender for which Borrower is acting as agent under the applicable Pledged Loan) to the Blocked Account (in the form so received). On (i) the last Business Day of each month and (ii) the first (1

	st

	) Business Day to occur after an Underlying Loan has been paid in full (but solely with respect to proceeds of such Underlying Loan), Agent shall transfer 100% of cleared funds in the Blocked Account and the Lockbox Account (if established) to the Collection Account, via wire transfer, for distribution from the Collection Account by Agent in accordance with

	(c)     Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation,

	Section 6.17

	below (and without limiting the application thereof)), in addition to payments in the ordinary course of business as set forth above, the Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part by Borrower at any time upon not less than two (2) Business Days prior written notice (any such date on which the Loan is to be prepaid, referred to herein as the “


	Prepayment Date


	”). If the Loan is to be prepaid as provided in this

	clause (c)

	, the prepayment price shall be equal to the sum of (

	x

	) the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the Loan to be voluntarily prepaid (the “


	Prepayment Amount


	”),

	plus

	(

	y

	) accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment Amount to the Prepayment Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, no voluntary prepayment under this Agreement shall affect Agent’s rights or any of the Obligations existing as of the Prepayment Date, and the provisions of the Loan Documents shall continue to be fully operative until the Obligations (other than indemnity obligations under the Loan Documents that are not then due and payable or for which any events or claims that would give rise thereto are pending) have been fully performed and indefeasibly paid in cash in full.

	44




	 




	 




	(b)     If, at any time for any reason (including, without limitation, as a result of one or more Pledged Loans no longer constituting Eligible Loans (as a result of no longer complying with the eligibility criteria set forth in the definition thereof) and/or as a result of a decrease in Fair Value and/or Enterprise Value (as calculated by Borrower’s internal valuation methodology and/or any updated third party valuation report received by Agent pursuant to

	Section 6.1(i)

	hereof) as it applies to one or more Pledged Loans or Underlying Borrowers, as applicable), the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the Loan exceeds the value, in Dollars, of one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Borrowing Base, Borrower shall immediately, without the necessity of any notice or demand, and whether or not a Default or an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing, either immediately (i) prepay the principal balance of the Loan in an amount equal to the difference between such sum and the value, in Dollars, of one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Borrowing Base (all accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such difference shall be simultaneously prepaid) or (b) so long as Revolving Period is then in effect, increase the aggregate principal amount of Eligible Loans included in the calculation of the Borrowing Base so that the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the Loan is less than or equal to the value, in Dollars, of one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate Borrowing Base. The pledge and delivery to Agent of additional Eligible Loans shall comply with the document delivery requirements set forth in

	Section 4.2

	, and shall be accompanied by a written certification of Borrower to the effect that such additional Pledged Loans are Eligible Loans and that, after giving effect to the pledge to Agent of such Eligible Loans no Default or Event of Default will exist.




	 





	2.7     Other Mandatory Prepayments





	 




	(a)     If a Change of Control occurs that has not been consented to in writing by the Requisite Lenders (at their sole option) prior to the consummation thereof, on or prior to the first Business Day following the date of such Change of Control, Borrower shall prepay the Loan and all other Obligations in full in cash together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment and all other amounts owing to Agent and Lenders under the Loan Documents.




	 




	(b)     In addition to the foregoing, during the Amortization Period, Borrower shall pay down the principal balance of the Loan on a monthly basis in equal installments during the relevant calendar quarter, whether via the remittance of proceeds pursuant to

	Section 2.5(a)

	or otherwise, so that the principal balance of the Loan will be reduced by an amount equal to or greater than (i)


	four percent (



	4%


	)



	of the Maximum Loan Amount for each of the first two (2) full calendar quarters following the termination of the Revolving Period, (ii)


	six percent (



	6%


	)



	of the Maximum Loan Amount for each of the succeeding two (2) full calendar quarters and (iii)


	seven and one-half percent (



	7.5%


	)



	of the Maximum Loan Amount for each of the succeeding two (2) full calendar quarters.










	 




	(c)     During the Amortization Period, if Borrower, in any transaction or series of related transactions, sells or issues any equity or debt securities, Equity Interests or other ownership interests other than in accordance with and pursuant to any employee stock option or similar plan, then Borrower shall apply 100% (or such lesser amount as is required to indefeasibly pay in cash in full the Obligations and all other amounts outstanding under the Loan Documents (other than indemnity obligations under the Loan Documents that are not then due and payable or for which any events or claims that would give rise thereto are not then pending)) of the cash proceeds thereof (net of reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket transaction costs and expenses and taxes) to the prepayment of the Obligations and other amounts outstanding under the Loan Documents.

	2.8     Payments by Agent; Protective Advances





	 




	(a)     Should any amount required to be paid under any Loan Document be unpaid beyond any applicable cure period, such amount may be paid by Agent, for the account of Agent or Lenders, which payment shall be deemed a request for an Advance under the Loan as of the date such payment is due, and Borrower irrevocably authorizes disbursement of any such funds by Agent, by way of direct payment of the relevant amount, interest or Obligations in accordance with

	Section 2.5

	without necessity of any demand whether or not a Default or an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing. No payment or prepayment of any amount by Agent, Lenders or any other Person shall entitle any Person to be subrogated to the rights of Agent and/or Lenders under any Loan Document unless and until the Obligations have been fully performed and paid indefeasibly in cash and the Commitments have been terminated. Any sums expended or amounts paid by Agent and/or Lenders as a result of Borrower’s failure to pay, perform or comply with any Loan Document or any of the Obligations may be charged to Borrower’s account as an Advance under the Loan and added to the Obligations.




	 




	(b)     Notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document, Agent, in its sole discretion, shall have the right, but not any obligation, at any time that Borrower fails to do so, and from time to time, without prior notice, to: (i) obtain insurance (at Borrower’s expense) covering any of the Underlying Collateral to the extent not obtained as required under any Underlying Loan Document or upon the Underlying Borrower’s failure to do so; (ii) discharge (at Borrower’s expense) taxes or Liens affecting any of the Underlying Collateral that have not been paid in violation of any Underlying Loan Document or that jeopardizes Borrower’s or Agent’s Lien priority in the Underlying Collateral; or (iii) make any other payment (at Borrower’s expense) for the administration, servicing, maintenance, preservation or protection of the Underlying Collateral or Collateral. Agent shall be reimbursed for all such advances pursuant to

	Section 2.5

	and any such advances shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate from the date the Advance is made until it is repaid. No such advance by Agent shall be construed as a waiver by Agent, or any Lender of any Default or Event of Default or any of the rights or remedies of Agent or any Lender.

	(a)     To secure the payment and performance of the Obligations, Borrower hereby grants to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, a valid, perfected and continuing first-priority security interest in and Lien upon, and pledges to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, all of Borrower’s assets, personal property, goods, Instruments, Equipment, Inventory, Fixtures, Accounts, General Intangibles, Chattel Paper, Contract Rights, Contracts, Documents, Letter-of-Credit Rights, Deposit Accounts, Software, Money, Investment Property, Health-Care-Insurance Receivables, Supporting Obligations and the Proceeds of each and all other types of property, in each case whether now owned or existing or hereafter from time to time acquired or coming into existence, including without limitation, all of Borrower’s right, title and interest in, to and under all of the following, whether now owned or existing or hereafter from time to time acquired or coming into existence:

	(c)     Borrower has full right and power to grant to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, a perfected, first-priority security interest and Lien on the Collateral pursuant to this Agreement, subject to no transfer or other restrictions or Liens of any kind in favor of any other Person.

To the extent that collections from such assigned Pledged Loans exceed the amount of the outstanding Obligations, upon confirmation by Agent of such excess amount and so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such excess amount shall be refunded to Borrower upon written request in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

	(f)     Promptly upon learning of the anticipated payment in full of any Pledged Loan, Borrower shall give written notice thereof to Agent. Within two (2) Business Days after the actual payment in full of any Pledged Loan and delivery of the proceeds thereof to the Blocked Account in accordance with

	Section 2.4

	hereof, Borrower shall give written notice thereof to Agent and Custodian of such payment.




	 




	(g)     Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom, then upon Agent’s receipt of (i) a written request for the release of Agent’s Lien on any Pledged Loan, (ii) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Agent in its sole discretion, evidence acceptable to Agent that such Pledged Loan is being sold to a third-party, non-Affiliate of Borrower on an arms-length basis for which purchase no Affiliate of Borrower is providing seller financing in connection with such sale and (iii) receipt of payment (or payment into escrow pursuant to a mechanism acceptable to Agent) of an amount equal to (A) 100% of the net proceeds of the sale of such Pledged Loan

Upon the request of Borrower, Agent agrees to provide a payoff letter, in form and substance acceptable to Agent, for the release of Agent’s Lien on any such Pledged Loan, subject to the terms and conditions of this

	Section 2.11(g)

	. Borrower shall bear the responsibility of recording any such documents and shall bear all out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and disbursements of Agent or any Lender) in connection with such payoff letter, release, reassignment and delivery.

In addition, if Borrower breaches its obligation hereunder to direct payments of Pledged Loans or other Accounts or the proceeds of any other Collateral to the Lockbox Account, Agent, as the irrevocably made, constituted and appointed true and lawful attorney for such Person pursuant to this paragraph, may, by the signature or other act of any of Agent’s officers or authorized signatories (without requiring any of them to do so), direct any federal, state or private payor or fiscal intermediary to pay proceeds of Pledged Loans or other Accounts or any other Collateral to the Lockbox Account or another account designated in writing by Agent.




	 





	(b)     



	The power of attorney granted pursuant to the Power of Attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until the Obligations have been paid in full. The powers conferred on Agent under the Power of Attorney are solely to protect the Agent’s and the Lenders’ interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon Agent or any Lender to exercise any such powers. Agent agrees that (

	a



	i



	) except as specified in the Power of Attorney, it shall not exercise any power or authority granted under the Power of Attorney unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (

	b



	ii



	) Agent shall account for any monies received by Agent in respect of any foreclosure on or disposition of Collateral pursuant to the Power of Attorney

	,



	;




	provided



	,



	that Agent shall not have any duty as to any Collateral, and Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers. NEITHER AGENT NOR ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO ANY GRANTOR FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE SOLELY TO ITS OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS FINALLY DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, NOR FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

	All fees hereunder (other than the Commitment Fee) shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and for the actual number of days elapsed in each calculation period, as applicable. In no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise, shall the interest and other charges paid or agreed to be paid to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, for the use, forbearance or detention of money hereunder exceed the maximum rate permissible under Applicable Law which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem applicable hereto. If, due to any circumstance whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof, at the time performance of such provision shall be due, shall exceed any such limit, then the obligation to be so fulfilled shall be reduced to such lawful limit, and, if Agent or Lenders shall have received interest or any other charges of any kind which might be deemed to be interest under Applicable Law in excess of the Maximum Rate, then such excess shall be applied first to any unpaid fees and charges hereunder, then to unpaid principal balance owed by Borrower hereunder, and if the then remaining excess interest is greater than the previously unpaid principal balance, Agent and Lenders shall promptly refund such excess amount to Borrower and the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible rate. The terms and provisions of this

	Default Rate


	”). Interest at the Default Rate shall accrue from the initial date of such Event of Default until such Event of Default is waived, and shall be payable upon demand.




	 





	3.6     Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy





	 




	(a)     If any Change in Law shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.




	 




	(b)     If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, as applicable, could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company, as applicable, with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender’s or such Lender’s holding company, as applicable, for any such reduction suffered.

	Sections 3.6(a)

	and

	(b),

	shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.




	 




	(d)     Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this

	Section 3.6

	shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation;

	provided



	,



	that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this

	Section 3.6

	for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date such Lender notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor;

	provided


	further



	,



	that

	,


	if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive or if Lender is prohibited under Applicable Law from giving such notice, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof or any period where such notice could not lawfully be given.







	 





	3.7     Standby Letters of Credit Fee





	 




	(a)     For the period from and including the date of issuance of each Standby Letter of Credit to and including the date of termination or expiration of such Standby Letter of Credit, Borrower shall pay to Agent (for the benefit of the applicable L/C Issuer) a standby letter of credit fee equal to four and one-half of one percent (4.50%) per annum (the “

	Standby Letter of Credit Fee

	”) of the aggregate, undrawn face amount of all outstanding Standby Letters of Credit issued for the account of Borrower, which fee shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, all Standby Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable on demand at a rate equal to (

	x

	) the Standby Letter of Credit Fee,

	plus

	(

	y

	) three percent (3.00%) per annum, in each case, on the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Standby Letters of Credit issued for the account of Borrower. Borrower also shall pay on demand the normal and customary administrative charges for issuance, amendment, negotiation, renewal or extension of any Standby Letter of Credit imposed by the applicable L/C Issuer.




	 




	(b)     On demand by Agent at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Borrower will cause cash to be deposited and maintained in an account with Agent, as cash Collateral, in an amount equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the Letter of Credit Usage, and Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent, in its discretion, on Borrower’s behalf and in Borrower’s name, to open such an account and to make and maintain deposits therein, or in an account opened by Borrower, in the amounts required to be made by Borrower, out of the proceeds of Collateral or out of any other funds of Borrower coming into Agent’s possession at any time. Agent will invest such cash Collateral (less applicable reserves) in such short-term money-market items as to which Agent in its Permitted Discretion may determine and the net return on such investments shall be credited to such account and constitute additional cash Collateral. Borrower may not withdraw amounts credited to any such account unless all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, all Standby Letters of Credit have expired or been terminated and this Agreement has been terminated.”

	Section 6.17

	, and no such rights shall extend to any successors or assigns of Pacific Western Bank.

	9.1     Rights and Remedies





	 




	(a)     In addition to the acceleration provisions set forth in

	Article VIII

	above, upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, Agent shall have the right to (and at the request of Requisite Lenders, shall) exercise any and all rights, options and remedies provided for in any Loan Document, under the UCC or at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the right to (i) apply any property of Borrower held by Agent to reduce the Obligations, (ii) foreclose the Liens created under the Loan Documents, (iii) realize upon, take possession of and/or sell any Collateral or securities pledged, with or without judicial process, (iv) exercise all rights and powers with respect to the Collateral as Borrower might exercise, (v) collect and send notices regarding the Collateral, with or without judicial process, (vi) by its own means or with judicial assistance, enter any premises at which Collateral and/or pledged securities are located, or render any of the foregoing unusable or dispose of the Collateral and/or pledged securities on such premises without any liability for rent, storage, utilities, or other sums, and Borrower shall not resist or interfere with such action, (vii) at Borrower’s expense, require that all or any part of the Collateral be assembled and made available to Agent at any place designated by Agent in its sole discretion, (viii) reduce or otherwise change the amount of the Maximum Loan Amount, Availability, the Borrowing Base and/or any component of the foregoing and/or (ix) relinquish or abandon any Collateral or securities pledged or any Lien thereon.

Such expenses and advances shall be deemed Advances hereunder and shall be added to the Obligations until reimbursed to Agent, for its own account and for the benefit of the Lenders, and shall be secured by the Collateral, and such payments by Agent, for its own account and for the benefit of the Lenders, shall not be construed as a waiver by Agent or Lenders of any Event of Default or any other rights or remedies of Agent or Lenders.




	 




	 




	 


	89




	 




	 




	(b)     Borrower agrees that notice received at least ten (10) calendar days before the time of any intended public sale, or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of Collateral is to be made, shall be deemed to be reasonable notice of such sale or other disposition. If permitted by Applicable Law, any perishable Collateral which threatens to speedily decline in value or which is sold on a recognized market may be sold immediately by Lender without prior notice to Borrower. At any sale or disposition of Collateral or securities pledged, Agent may (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) purchase all or any part thereof free from any right of redemption by Borrower which right is hereby waived and released. Borrower covenants and agrees not to interfere with or impose any obstacle to Agent’s exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral. In dealing with or disposing of the Collateral or any part thereof, Agent shall not be required to give priority or preference to any item of Collateral or otherwise to marshal assets or to take possession or sell any Collateral with judicial process.

	second

	, ratably to the payment of all Obligations; (iii) 

	third

	, to the payment of any surplus then remaining to Borrower, unless otherwise provided by law or directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;

	provided



	,



	that Borrower shall be liable for any deficiency if such proceeds are insufficient to indefeasibly satisfy the Obligations or any of the other items referred to in this Section in full in cash.





	 




	Notwithstanding the foregoing, Obligations arising under Bank Products Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as Agent may request, from the applicable Lender or Affiliate of such Lender.




	 





	9.3     Rights to Appoint Receiver





	 




	Without limiting and in addition to any other rights, options and remedies Agent and Lenders have under the Loan Documents, the UCC, at law or in equity, upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, Agent shall have the right to apply for and have a receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction in any action taken by Agent and/or any Lender to enforce its rights and remedies in order to manage, protect and preserve the Collateral and continue the operation of the business of Borrower and to collect all revenues and profits thereof and apply the same to the payment of all expenses and other charges of such receivership including the compensation of the receiver and to the payments as aforesaid until a sale or other disposition of such Collateral shall be finally made and consummated.




	 




	 




	 


	90




	 




	 





	9.4     Attorney-in-Fact





	 




	Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints (which appointment is coupled with an interest) Agent as its attorney-in-fact for the limited purpose of taking any action permitted under the Loan Documents that Agent deems necessary or desirable (in Agent’s sole discretion) upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default to protect and realize upon Agent’s Lien in the Collateral, including the execution and delivery of any and all documents or instruments related to the Collateral in Borrower’s name, and said appointment shall create in Agent a power coupled with an interest.




	 





	9.5     Rights and Remedies not Exclusive





	 




	Agent shall have the right in its sole discretion to determine which rights, Liens and/or remedies Agent and Lenders may at any time pursue, relinquish, subordinate or modify, and such determination will not in any way modify or affect any of Agent’s or Lenders’ rights, Liens or remedies under any Loan Document, Applicable Law or equity. The enumeration of any rights and remedies in any Loan Document is not intended to be exhaustive, and all rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders described in any Loan Document are cumulative and are not alternative to or exclusive of any other rights or remedies which Agent and Lenders otherwise may have. The partial or complete exercise of any right or remedy shall not preclude any other further exercise of such or any other right or remedy.




	 





	X.     WAIVERS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS

Borrower hereby waives any and all defenses and counterclaims it may have or could interpose in any action or procedure brought by Agent to obtain an order of court recognizing the assignment of, or Lien of Agent in and to, any Collateral.




	 





	10.2     Delay; No Waiver of Defaults





	 




	No course of action or dealing, renewal, release or extension of any provision of any Loan Document, or single or partial exercise of any such provision, or delay, failure or omission on Agent’s part in enforcing any such provision shall affect the liability of Borrower or operate as a waiver of such provision or preclude any other or further exercise of such provision. No waiver by any party to any Loan Document of any one or more defaults by any other party in the performance of any of the provisions of any Loan Document shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any future default, whether of a like or different nature, and each such waiver shall be limited solely to the express terms and provisions of such waiver. Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, by completing the Closing under this Agreement and/or by making Advances, Lender does not waive any breach of any representation or warranty of under any Loan Document, and all of Agent’s or any Lender’s claims and rights resulting from any such breach or misrepresentation are specifically reserved.

SUCH PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WITH CALIFORNIA RULES OF EVIDENCE AND DISCOVERY APPLICABLE TO SUCH PROCEEDING. IN THE EVENT CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARE TO BE RESOLVED BY JUDICIAL REFERENCE, ANY PARTY MAY SEEK FROM ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOVER ANY PREJUDGMENT ORDER, WRIT OR OTHER RELIEF AND HAVE SUCH PREJUDGMENT ORDER, WRIT OR OTHER RELIEF ENFORCED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW NOTWITHSTANDING THAT ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO RESOLUTION BY JUDICIAL REFERENCE.

	so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no such Participant shall be a BDC or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of a BDC. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of a participation to a Participant, (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan (and any Note evidencing such Loan) for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) Borrower shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (v) all amounts payable pursuant to

	Section 6.2

	by Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation. Any agreement pursuant to which a Lender shall sell any such participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to exercise such Lender’s rights and enforce Borrower’s obligations hereunder, including the right to consent to any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;

	provided



	,



	that such participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree, without the consent of the Participant, to any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of: (A) any reduction in the principal amount, interest rate or fees payable with respect to any Loan in which such holder participates; (B) any extension of the termination date of this Agreement or the date fixed for any payment of principal, interest or fees payable with respect to any Loan in which such holder participates; and (C) any release of all or substantially all of the Collateral (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Loan Documents). Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Participant under each participation shall, solely for the purposes of

	Sections 12.4

	and

	12.7

	of this Agreement be considered to be a “Lender” hereunder.






	 




	(c)     Agent, on behalf of Borrower, shall maintain at its address referred to in

	Section 12.5

	a copy of each Lender Addition Agreement delivered to it and a written or electronic register (the “


	Register


	”) for the recordation of the names and addresses of Lenders and the Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loan owing to, and the Notes evidencing such Loan owned by, each Lender from time to time. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Borrower and Agent shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan, the Notes and the Commitment recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.




	 




	(d)     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no assignment under

	Section 12.2(a)

	of any rights or obligations under or in respect of the Loan or the Notes evidencing such Loan shall be effective unless and until Agent shall have recorded the assignment pursuant to

	Section 12.2(c).

	Upon its receipt of a Lender Addition Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and a Transferee, Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Lender Addition Agreement and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give prompt notice of such acceptance and recordation to Lender and Borrower. On or prior to such effective date, the assigning Lender shall surrender any outstanding Notes held by it, all or a portion of which are being assigned, and Borrower, at its own expense, shall, upon the request of Agent by the assigning Lender or the Transferee, as applicable, execute and deliver to Agent, within five (5) Business Days of any request, new Notes to reflect the interest held by the assigning Lender and its Transferee.




	 




	 




	 


	96




	 




	 




	(e)     Any Lender may furnish any information concerning Borrower in the possession of such Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants).




	 




	(f)     Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, a Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Loan owing to it and the Notes held by it and the other Loan Documents and Collateral.




	 




	(g)     Borrower agrees to use commercially reasonable best efforts to assist each Lender in assigning or selling participations in all or any part of any Loan made by any Lender to another Person identified by such Lender.




	 




	(h)     Notwithstanding anything in the Loan Documents to the contrary, (i) a Lender and its Affiliates shall not be required to execute and deliver a Lender Addition Agreement in connection with any transaction involving its Affiliates or lenders, (ii) no lender to or funding or financing source of any Lender or its Affiliates shall be considered a Transferee, (iii) there shall be no limitation or restriction on any Lender’s ability to assign or otherwise transfer any Loan Document to any such Affiliate or lender or funding or financing source, and (iv) there shall be no limitation or restriction on such Affiliates’ or lenders’ or financing or funding sources’ ability to assign or otherwise transfer any Loan Document, Loan, Note or Obligation (or any of its rights thereunder or interest therein);

	provided

	,

	however

	, such Lender shall continue to be liable as a “Lender” under the Loan Documents unless such Affiliate or lender or funding or financing source executes a Lender Addition Agreement and thereby becomes a “Lender”.




	 




	(i)     The Loan Documents shall inure to the benefit of Agent, Lenders, Transferee, Participant (to the extent expressly provided herein only) and all future holders of the Notes, the Obligations and/or any of the Collateral, and each of their respective successors and permitted assigns. Each Loan Document shall be binding upon the Persons other than Agent that are parties thereto and their respective successors and assigns, and no such Person may assign, delegate or transfer any Loan Document or any of its rights or obligations thereunder without the prior written consent of Agent. No rights are intended to be created under any Loan Document for the benefit of any third party donee, creditor or incidental beneficiary of Borrower. Nothing contained in any Loan Document shall be construed as a delegation to Agent of any other Person’s duty of performance. BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT AGENT AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME MAY (I) DIVIDE AND REISSUE (WITHOUT SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES OTHER THAN THOSE RESULTING FROM SUCH DIVISION) THE NOTES, AND/OR (II) SELL, ASSIGN OR GRANT PARTICIPATING INTERESTS IN OR TRANSFER ALL OR ANY PART OF ITS RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, NOTE, THE OBLIGATIONS AND/OR THE COLLATERAL TO OTHER PERSONS, IN EACH CASE ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVIDED HEREIN. Each Transferee and Participant shall have all of the rights, obligations and benefits with respect to the Obligations, Notes, Collateral and/or Loan Documents held by it as fully as if the original holder thereof;

	provided



	,



	that

	,


	notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, Borrower shall not be obligated to pay under this Agreement to any Transferee or Participant any sum in excess of the sum which it would have been obligated to pay to Agent had such participation not been effected. Agent may disclose to any Transferee or Participant all information, reports, financial statements, certificates and documents obtained under any provision of any Loan Document;

	provided



	,



	that Transferees and Participants shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions contained herein that are applicable to Agent.







	 




	 




	 


	97




	 




	 




	(j)     Any Lender may assign or pledge all or any portion of the Loans or Notes held by it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation, any assignment or pledge pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank

	,



	;




	provided

	, that any payment in respect of such assigned Loans or Notes made by Borrower to or for the account of the assigning or pledging Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy Borrower’s obligations hereunder in respect to such assigned Loans or Notes to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder.





	 





	12.3     Application of Payments





	 




	To the extent that any payment made or received with respect to the Obligations is subsequently invalidated, determined to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, defeased or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other Person under any Debtor Relief Law, common law or equitable cause or any other law, then the Obligations intended to be satisfied by such payment shall be revived and shall continue as if such payment had not been received by Agent and the Liens created hereby shall be revived automatically without any action on the part of any party hereto and shall continue as if such payment had not been received by Agent. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, any payments with respect to the Obligations received shall be credited and applied in such manner and order as Agent shall decide in its sole discretion.




	 




	 




	 


	98




	 




	 





	12.4     Indemnity





	 




	Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Agent, each Lender, each Participant, and their respective Affiliates, managers, members, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors, assigns, accountants and attorneys (collectively, the “


	Indemnified Persons


	”) from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and in-house documentation and diligence fees and legal expenses) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnified Person with respect to or arising out of, or in any litigation, proceeding or investigation instituted or conducted by any Person with respect to any aspect of, or any transaction contemplated by, or any matter related to, any act of or omission by Borrower or, any of its Affiliates acting on Borrower’s behalf or any of their respective managers, members, officers, employees, agents, or representatives, including, without limitation: (i) fraud, willful misconduct, misrepresentation or failure to disclose a material fact by or on behalf of Borrower, or any of its respective agents or representatives in connection with the Loan, including by reason of any claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO); (ii) any theft, misappropriation or conversion by or on behalf of Borrower of Collateral (including failure to turn over to Agent on demand following an Event of Default); (iii) any misappropriation of funds of use of the proceeds of the Loan not in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iv) the forfeiture by Borrower of any Collateral, or any portion thereof, because of the conduct or purported conduct of criminal activity by Borrower or, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective managers, members, officers, employees, agents, or representatives; (v) any Change of Control not approved in writing by Agent (at its sole option); (vi) any waste, transfer, sale, encumbrance or other disposal of the Collateral not permitted by the Loan Agreement or the other Loan Document; or (vii) the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or indemnification in any Loan Document concerning Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances. If any Indemnified Person uses in-house counsel for any purpose for which Borrower is responsible to pay or indemnify, Borrower expressly agrees that their indemnification obligations include reasonable charges for such work commensurate with the fees that would otherwise be charged by outside legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Person in its sole discretion for the work performed. Agent agrees to give Borrower reasonable notice of any event of which Agent becomes aware for which indemnification may be required under this

	Section 12.4

	, and Agent may elect (but is not obligated) to direct the defense thereof;

	provided




	,



	that the selection of counsel shall be subject to Borrower’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and Borrower shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any matter for which indemnification may be required under this

	Section 12.4

	and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such matter. Any Indemnified Person may, in its reasonable discretion, take such actions as it deems necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be necessary for the protection of such Indemnified Person or the Collateral, subject to Borrower’s prior approval of any settlement, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any insurer agrees to undertake the defense of an event (an “


	Insured Event


	”), Agent agrees not to exercise its right to select counsel to defend the event if that would cause Borrower’s insurer to deny coverage;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that Agent reserves the right to retain counsel to represent any Indemnified Person with respect to an Insured Event at its sole cost and expense. To the extent that Agent obtains recovery from a third party other than an Indemnified Person of any of the amounts that Borrower has paid to Lender pursuant to the indemnity set forth in this

	Section 12.4

	, then Agent shall promptly pay to Borrower the amount of such recovery. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Borrower hereby indemnifies the Indemnified Parties for all claims for brokerage fees or commissions (other than claims of a broker with whom such Indemnified Party has directly contracted in writing) which may be made in connection with respect to any aspect of, or any transaction contemplated by or referred to in, or any matter related to, any Loan Document or any agreement, document or transaction contemplated thereby.




	 




	 




	 


	99




	 




	 





	12.5     Notice





	 




	Any notice or request under any Loan Document shall be given to any party to this Agreement at such party’s address set forth beneath its signature on the signature page to this Agreement, or at such other address as such party may hereafter specify in a notice given in the manner required under this

	Section 12.5

	. Any notice or request hereunder shall be given only by, and shall be deemed to have been received upon (each, a “


	Receipt


	”): (i) registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, on the date on which such received as indicated in such return receipt, (ii) delivery by a nationally recognized overnight courier, one (1) Business Day after deposit with such courier, or (iii) facsimile or electronic transmission, in each case upon telephone or further electronic communication from the recipient acknowledging receipt (whether automatic or manual from recipient), as applicable.




	 





	12.6     Severability; Captions; Counterparts; Electronic Signatures





	 




	If any provision of any Loan Document is adjudicated to be invalid under Applicable Laws or regulations, such provision shall be inapplicable to the extent of such invalidity without affecting the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the Loan Documents which shall be given effect so far as possible. The captions in the Loan Documents are intended for convenience and reference only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the Loan Documents. The Loan Documents may be executed in one or more counterparts (which taken together, as applicable, shall constitute one and the same instrument) and by electronic transmission, which facsimile signatures shall be considered original executed counterparts. Each party to this Agreement agrees that it will be bound by its own facsimile signature and that it accepts the facsimile signature of each other party.




	 





	12.7     Expenses





	 




	Borrower shall pay, whether or not the Closing occurs, all fees, costs and expenses incurred or earned by Agent, any Lender, and/or its Affiliates, including, without limitation, portfolio management, documentation and diligence fees and expenses, all search, audit, appraisal, recording, professional and filing fees and expenses and all other charges and expenses (including, without limitation, UCC and judgment and tax lien searches and UCC filings and fees for post-Closing UCC and judgment and tax lien searches and wire transfer fees and audit expenses), and reasonable internal and external attorneys’ fees and expenses, (i) in any effort to enforce, protect or collect payment of any Obligation or to enforce any Loan Document or any related agreement, document or instrument, (ii) in connection with entering into, negotiating, preparing, reviewing and executing the Loan Documents and/or any related agreements, documents or instruments, (iii) arising in any way out of administration of the Obligations or the taking or refraining from taking by Agent of any action requested by Borrower, (iv) in connection with instituting, maintaining, preserving, enforcing and/or foreclosing on Agent’s Liens in any of the Collateral or securities pledged under the Loan Documents, whether through judicial proceedings or otherwise, (v) in defending or prosecuting any actions, claims or proceedings arising out of or relating to Agent’s or any Lender’s transactions with Borrower, (vi) in seeking, obtaining or receiving any advice with respect to its rights and obligations under any Loan Document and any related agreement, document or instrument, (vii) arising out of or relating to any Default or Event of Default or occurring thereafter or as a result thereof, (viii) in connection with all actions, visits, audits and inspections undertaken by Agent or its Affiliates pursuant to the Loan Documents, and/or (ix) in connection with any modification, restatement, supplement, amendment, waiver or extension of any Loan Document and/or any related agreement, document or instrument. All of the foregoing shall be charged to Borrower’s account and shall be part of the Obligations. If Lender or any of its Affiliates uses in-house counsel for any purpose under any Loan Document for which Borrower is responsible to pay or indemnify, Borrower expressly agrees that its Obligations include reasonable charges for such work commensurate with the fees that would otherwise be charged by outside legal counsel selected by Agent or such Affiliate in its sole discretion for the work performed. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower shall pay all Taxes (other than Taxes based upon or measured by a Lender’s income or revenues or any personal property tax), if any, in connection with the issuance of any Note and the filing and/or recording of any documents and/or financing statements.

	12.8     Entire Agreement





	 




	This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party constitute the entire agreement between Borrower, Agent and Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings (including but not limited to the term sheet dated on or about May, 2013), if any, relating to the subject matter hereof or thereof. Any promises, representations, warranties or guarantees not herein contained and hereinafter made shall have no force and effect unless in writing signed by Borrower, Agent and Requisite Lenders, as appropriate. Except as otherwise permitted in

	Section 10.4

	and

	Section 13.2

	, and subject to

	Section 13.2

	, no provision of any Loan Document may be changed, modified, amended, restated, waived, supplemented, discharged, canceled or terminated orally or by any course of dealing or in any other manner other than by in writing signed by Borrower, Agent and Requisite Lenders

	,



	;




	provided

	, that no consent or agreement by Borrower shall be required to amend, modify, change, restate, waive, supplement, discharge, cancel or terminate any provision of

	Article XII

	so long as no additional duties are required to be assumed by Borrower. Each party hereto acknowledges that it has been advised by counsel in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and is not relying upon oral representations or statements inconsistent with the terms and provisions hereof. The schedules attached hereto may be amended or supplemented by Borrower upon delivery to Agent of such amendments or supplements and, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, the written approval thereof by Agent.





	 





	12.9     Approvals and Duties





	 




	Unless expressly provided herein to the contrary, any approval, consent, waiver or satisfaction of Agent with respect to any matter that is subject of any Loan Document may be granted or withheld by Agent, the Lenders or any Lender, as applicable, in its sole and absolute discretion. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any responsibility for or obligation or duty with respect to any of the Collateral or any matter or proceeding arising out of or relating thereto, including, without limitation, any obligation or duty to collect any sums due in respect thereof or to protect or preserve any rights pertaining thereto.

	12.10     Confidential/Publicity





	 




	(a)     Borrower, Agent and Lenders shall mutually agree on the contents of any press release, public announcement or other public disclosure regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder to be made following the mutual execution and delivery of this Agreement;

	provided



	,



	that

	,


	(i) Agent or any Lender may disclose the terms hereof and give copies of the Loan Documents to assignees and participants and to prospective assignees and participants and (ii) Borrower may disclose the terms and copies hereof in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and thereafter such information shall be made generally available in the public domain. If either party fails to respond to the other party in writing with either an approval or a disapproval within five (5) Business Days of a party’s receipt of the other party’s request for consent or approval as expressly contemplated pursuant to this

	Section 12.10

	, then such consent or approval will be deemed to have been given

	,



	;




	provided



	,



	that such five (5) Business Day period will not commence to run unless and until the other party has received all information, materials, documents and other matters required to be submitted to it hereunder, with respect to such consent or approval and all other information, materials, documents and other matters reasonably essential to its decision process.








	 




	(b)     Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Agent, use the name of Agent or any Lender in connection with any of its business activities, except in connection with internal business matters, potential or current investors and/or lenders, and as required in dealings with governmental agencies and other financial institutions and as may otherwise be required pursuant to Applicable Laws or in a press release with respect to the Loan. Upon the consent of Borrower, Agent and Lenders may use the name of Borrower and any of its Affiliates in any press release, advertisement or other promotional materials issued with respect to the Loan.




	 




	(c)     Agent and each Lender (each a “

	Receiving Party

	”) understands that Borrower may disclose to a Receiving Party confidential or proprietary information relating to Borrower’s business, including, without limitation: (i) marketing philosophy, objectives, strategies and information; (ii) competitive advantages and disadvantages; (iii) cost, pricing, budgets and other financial data, information, objectives and strategies; (iv) information concerning customers, vendors and other business partners; (v) market position and objectives; (vi) business methods; (vii) data processing and management information systems, programs and practices; (viii) application, operating system, communication and other software; (ix) source and object code, technical data, system architecture, formulae, flowcharts and algorithms; (x) trade secrets and any other information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public; (xi) insurance and risk management related quotes, costs, data and/or information and (xii) any and all improvements or additions to any of the above (together, “

	Confidential Information

	”)




	 




	(d)     In consideration of access Receiving Party may be provided to Confidential Information, Receiving Party hereby agrees: (i) to hold the Confidential Information in confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all precautions Receiving Party employs with respect to its most confidential materials; (ii) not to sell, copy, transfer, modify, publish, or display any such Confidential Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person;

	provided



	,



	that Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information to its Representatives who have a legitimate “need to know” for the sole purpose of providing support to those individuals who have such need

	,



	;




	provided



	,



	that such Representatives are informed of the confidential nature of such information and must have agreed to treat such Confidential Information (which agreement may be oral) in accordance with the terms of this

	Section 12.10

	, and (iii) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Confidential Information except for the purposes contemplated by the parties in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or otherwise, Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach or threatened breach of the confidentiality obligations set forth herein by Receiving Party or any Representative of said Receiving Party.







	 




	 




	 


	102




	 




	 




	(e)     Confidential Information will not include, however, information which: (a) was publicly known or made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of receipt by Receiving Party; (b) becomes publicly known or made generally available in the public domain after receipt by Receiving Party through no action or inaction by Receiving Party in breach of this

	Section 12.10

	; (c) at the time of receipt by Receiving Party, was already in Receiving Party’s possession, as evidenced by Receiving Party’s files and records immediately prior to Receiving Party’s receipt thereof; (d) is obtained by Receiving Party from a Person other than Borrower or Borrower’s Representatives without a breach of such Person’s obligations of confidentiality or similar obligation or violation by such Person of any Applicable Law; or (e) is independently developed by Receiving Party without use of or reference to any Confidential Information.




	 




	(f)     In the event that Receiving Party is required by Applicable Law or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, Receiving Party, if legally permissible, shall provide Borrower with immediate notice of such requirement in order to enable Borrower to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, to consult with Receiving Party with respect to Borrower’s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such requirement or legal process, or to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this

	Section 12.10

	. In any such event Receiving Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment and that any disclosure will be the minimum disclosure required under the circumstances. Nothing contained in this

	Section 12.10

	shall limit Agent or any Lender’s right to disclose such Confidential Information (i) as may be required in connection with such Person’s actual or potential exercise or enforcement of any right or remedy under any Loan Document or (ii) as may be required by regulatory authorities so long as such authorities are informed of the confidential nature of such information.




	 




	(g)     Each Receiving Party hereby acknowledges that United States securities laws prohibit any person with material, non-public information about a registered security from buying or selling such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other Person. Each Receiving Party hereby agrees that the Confidential Information may contain material, non-public information and further agrees to comply, and to insure compliance by its Representatives, with applicable securities laws concerning the Confidential Information, so long as any such disclosure comports with all Applicable Laws.




	 




	(h)     


	For purposes of this

	Section 12.10

	, “


	Representative


	” means, as to any Person, its affiliates and its and their directors, officers, employees, trustees, partners, members, managers, agents, advisors and professional consultants (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys and accountants), controlling Persons, lenders, funding or financing sources, and any applicable rating agency. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, references in this

	Section 12.10

	to Receiving Party shall include Receiving Party’s Representatives.




	 




	 




	 


	103




	 




	 





	12.11     Release of Collateral





	 




	So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon request of Borrower, Agent shall release any Lien granted to or held by Agent upon any Collateral being sold or disposed of in compliance with the provisions of the Loan Documents, as determined by Agent in its Permitted Discretion. Promptly following full performance and satisfaction and indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations and the termination of the Commitments and this Agreement, the Liens created hereby shall terminate and Agent shall execute and deliver such documents, at Borrower’s expense, as are necessary to release Agent’s Liens in the Collateral and shall return the Collateral to Borrower or the Person lawfully entitled thereto;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the parties agree that, notwithstanding any such termination or release or the execution, delivery or filing of any such documents or the return of any Collateral, if and to the extent that any such payment made or received with respect to the Obligations is subsequently invalidated, determined to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, defeased or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other Person under any Debtor Relief Law, common law or equitable cause or any other law, then the Obligations intended to be satisfied by such payment shall be revived and shall continue as if such payment had not been received by Agent and/or Lender and the Liens created hereby shall be revived automatically without any action on the part of any party hereto and shall continue as if such payment had not been received by Agent and/or Lender. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be deemed to have made any representation or warranty with respect to any Collateral so delivered except that such Collateral is free and clear, on the date of such delivery, of any and all Liens arising from Agent’s own acts.




	 





	12.12     Appointment of Servicer





	 




	(a)     Agent may from time to time enter into a servicing agreement (a “


	Loan Servicing Agreement


	”) with CapitalSource Finance LLC or an Affiliate of Agent or CapitalSource Finance LLC (a “


	Loan Servicer


	”) to service and enforce the Loan Documents and collect the Obligations on Agent’s behalf. Pursuant to the Loan Servicing Agreement, Agent may authorize the Loan Servicer to take certain actions, perform certain duties and exercise certain powers on Lender’s behalf under the provisions of the Loan Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to in this Agreement, all of to which Borrower hereby consent.




	 




	(b)     The Loan Servicer shall have no duties or responsibilities to Borrower, but only to Agent and then only as expressly set forth in the Loan Servicing Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Loan Servicer shall have no obligation to make any loans or advances to Borrower. Neither the Loan Servicer nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for any action taken or omitted by them under this Agreement or in connection herewith, unless caused by its or their willful misconduct. The Loan Servicer’s duties shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Loan Servicer any obligations with respect to the Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein. Neither Borrower nor Sponsor shall in any way be construed to be a third party beneficiary of any relationship between Loan Servicer and Agent.

	(c)     The Loan Servicer shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any communication whether written or oral believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it.




	 




	(d)     Borrower shall be entitled to rely upon any communication whether written or oral sent or made by the Loan Servicer for and on behalf of Agent with respect to all matters pertaining to the Loan Documents and Borrower’ duties and obligations hereunder, unless and until Borrower receive written notice from Lender that the Loan Servicer is no longer servicing the Loans.




	 




	(e)     The Loan Servicing Agreement may be terminated at any time without prior notice to or consent of Borrower, and Agent will notify Borrower within a reasonable period of time thereafter of such termination. Upon termination of the Loan Servicing Agreement and failure to replace the Loan Servicing Agreement with a new servicing agreement, all references herein to the Loan Servicer shall thereafter mean and refer to Lender.

	(a)     

	Appointment

	. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Pacific Western as the administrative agent, payment agent and collateral agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Pacific Western, as Agent for such Lender, to take such action or to refrain from taking such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent agrees to act as such on the conditions contained in this

	Article XIII

	. The provisions of this

	Article XIII

	are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, and Borrower shall have no rights as third-party beneficiaries of any of the provisions of this

	Article XIII

	other than the second sentence of

	Section 13.1(h)(iii).

	Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Loan Documents, by or through its agents, employees or sub-agents. Agent may not be removed hereunder without its prior written consent.




	 




	(b)     

	Nature of Duties

	. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, Agent is acting solely on behalf of Lenders, and its duties are administrative in nature, and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed, any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for Lenders, other than as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, or Borrower. Agent shall have no duties, obligations or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents. Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. Each Lender shall make its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower in connection with the extension of credit hereunder and shall make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Borrower. Except for information, notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to Lenders by Agent hereunder or given to Agent for the account of or with copies for Lenders, Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the Closing Date or at any time or times thereafter. If Agent seeks the consent or approval of any Lenders to the taking or refraining from taking any action hereunder, then Agent shall send prior written notice thereof to each Lender. Agent shall promptly notify each Lender in writing any time that the applicable percentage of Lenders have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.




	 




	 




	 


	105




	 




	 




	(c)     

	Rights, Exculpation, Etc

	. Neither Agent nor any of its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys or agents shall be liable to any Lender for any action lawfully taken or omitted by them hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith;

	provided



	,



	that the foregoing shall not prevent Agent from being be liable to the extent of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction on a final and nonappealable basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent shall be obligated on the terms set forth herein for performance of its express duties and obligations hereunder. Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made shall be to recover from the other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree promptly to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). In performing its functions and duties hereunder, Agent shall exercise the same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account. Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower herein or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial condition of Borrower. Agent shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions, or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the financial condition of Borrower, or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default. Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the other Loan Documents Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant, and Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have received such instructions from the applicable percentage of Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the applicable percentage of Lenders and, notwithstanding the instructions of Lenders, Agent shall have no obligation to take any action if it, in good faith, believes that such action exposes Agent or any of its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys or agents to any personal liability unless Agent receives an indemnification satisfactory to it from Lenders with respect to such action.





	 




	 




	 


	106




	 




	 




	(d)     

	Reliance

	. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents or any telephone message or other communication (including any writing, telex, telecopy or telegram) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent in its sole discretion.




	 




	(e)     

	Indemnification

	. Each Lender, severally and not (i) jointly or (ii) jointly and severally, agrees to reimburse and indemnify and hold harmless Agent and its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys and agents (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrower), ratably according to their respective Pro Rata Share in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this subsection of the total outstanding Obligations (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Share immediately prior to such date of the total outstanding Obligations), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Agent or any of its officers, directors, managers, members, equity owners, employees, attorneys or agents in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, advances or disbursements to the extent resulting from Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction on a final and non-appealable basis. The obligations of Lenders under this

	Article XIII

	shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.




	 




	(f)     

	Agent in its Individual Capacity

	. With respect to the Loans made by it, if any, Pacific Western and its successors as Agent shall have, and may exercise, the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents, and is subject to the same obligations and liabilities, as and to the extent set forth in the Loan Documents, as any other Lender. The terms “Lenders” or “Requisite Lenders” or any similar terms shall include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of lending, banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with, Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Borrower as if it were not acting as Agent pursuant hereto.




	 




	(g)     

	Successor Agent

	.




	 




	(i)     

	Resignation

	. Agent may resign from the performance of all or part of its functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30) calendar days’ prior written notice to Borrower and Lenders. Such resignation shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Agent of appointment pursuant to

	clause (ii)

	below or as otherwise provided below.




	 




	 




	 


	107




	 




	 




	(ii)     

	Appointment of Successor

	. Upon any such notice of resignation pursuant to

	clause (g)(i)

	of this

	Section 13.1

	, Requisite Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent with the consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (or required if any Default or Event of Default exists);

	provided

	,

	however

	,


	that



	so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no such successor Agent shall be a BDC or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of a BDC. If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed within said thirty (30) calendar day period referenced in

	clause (g)(i)

	above, the retiring Agent, upon notice to Borrower, may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Agent with the consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (or required if any Default or Event of Default exists), who shall serve as Agent until such time as Requisite Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above;

	provided

	,

	however

	,


	that



	so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, no such successor Agent shall be a BDC or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of a BDC. If no successor Agent has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing within said thirty (30) calendar day period, the resignation shall become effective and Requisite Lenders thereafter shall perform all the duties of Agent hereunder, until such time, if any, as Requisite Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above.






	 




	(iii)     

	Successor Agent

	. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent under the Loan Documents by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and, upon the earlier of such acceptance or the effective date of the retiring Agent’s resignation, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents

	,



	;




	provided




	,



	that any indemnity rights or other rights in favor of such retiring Agent shall continue after and survive such resignation and succession. After any retiring Agent’s resignation as Agent under the Loan Documents, the provisions of this

	Article XIII

	shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under the Loan Documents.





	 




	(h)     

	Collateral Matters

	.




	 




	(i)     

	Collateral

	. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by Agent (or at the direction of the Requisite Lenders (or, where required by the express terms of this Agreement, a greater number of Lenders)) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or of the other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral, and the exercise by Agent (or at the direction of the Requisite Lenders (or, where so required, such greater number of Lenders)) of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of Lenders and Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Agent shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to (i) act as the disbursing and collecting agent for Lenders with respect to all payments and collections arising in connection herewith and with the Loan Documents in connection with the Collateral; (ii) execute and deliver each Loan Document relating to the Collateral and accept delivery of each such agreement delivered by the Credit Parties or any of their Subsidiaries; (iii) act as collateral agent for Lenders for purposes of the perfection of all security interests and Liens created by such agreements and all other purposes stated therein; (iv) manage, supervise and otherwise deal with the Collateral; (v) take such action as is necessary or desirable to maintain the perfection and priority of the security interests and Liens created or purported to be created by the Loan Documents relating to the Collateral; and (vi) except as may be otherwise specifically restricted by the terms hereof or of any other Loan Document, exercise all right and remedies given to such Agent and Lenders with respect to the Collateral under the Loan Documents relating thereto, Applicable Law or otherwise.




	 




	 




	 


	108




	 




	 




	(ii)     

	Release of Collateral

	. Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by Agent, for the benefit the of Lenders, upon any Property covered by the Loan Documents (A) upon termination of this Agreement and the payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification Obligations to the extent no claim giving rise thereto has been asserted); (B) constituting Property being sold or disposed of if Borrower certifies to Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with the provisions of the Loan Documents (and Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); or (C) constituting Property leased to any Borrower under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement or is about to expire and which has not been, and is not intended by Borrower to be, renewed or extended.




	 




	(iii)     

	Confirmation of Authority; Execution of Releases

	. Without in any manner limiting Agent’s authority to act without any specific or further authorization or consent by Lenders (as set forth in

	Section 13.1(h)(i)

	and

	(ii)

	), each Lender agrees to confirm in writing, upon request by Borrower, the authority to release any property covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents conferred upon Agent under

	Section 13.1(h)(ii).

	So long as no Event of Default exists, upon receipt by Agent of confirmation from the requisite percentage of Lenders of its authority to release any particular item or types of Property covered by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and upon at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written request by Borrower, Agent shall (and hereby is irrevocably authorized by Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, herein or pursuant hereto upon such Collateral;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that (A) Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in Agent’s opinion, would expose Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty (other than that such Collateral is free and clear, on the date of such delivery, of any and all Liens arising from such Person’s own acts), and (B) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower in respect of) all interests retained by Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower, including, without limitation, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents.




	 




	 




	 


	109




	 




	 




	(iv)     

	Absence of Duty

	. Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any Lender or any other Person to assure that the Collateral covered by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents exists or is owned by any Borrower or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered or that the Liens granted to Agent, on behalf of Lenders, herein or pursuant hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, enforced or maintained or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to Agent in this

	Section 13.1(h)

	or in any of the Loan Documents; it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral covered by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event related thereto, Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its discretion, given Agent’s own interest in Collateral covered by this Agreement or the Loan Documents as one of Lenders and Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to any of the other Lenders;

	provided




	,



	that Agent shall exercise the same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account.




	 




	(i)     

	Agency for Perfection

	. Each Lender hereby appoints Agent as agent for the purpose of perfecting Lenders’ security interest in Collateral which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC in any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender (other than Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender shall hold such Collateral for purposes of perfecting a security interest therein for the benefit of Lenders, notify Agent thereof and, promptly upon Agent’s request therefor, deliver such Collateral to Agent or otherwise act in respect thereof in accordance with Agent’s instructions.




	 




	(j)     

	Exercise of Remedies

	. Except as set forth in

	Section 13.4

	, each Lender agrees that it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement or any other Loan Document or to realize upon any Collateral security for the Loans or other Obligations; it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by Agent in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.




	 





	13.2     Amendments, Waivers and Consents





	 




	(a)     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Borrower and the Requisite Lenders (or by the Agent on their behalf) without taking into account the Revolving Exposure and/or Commitments held by Defaulting Lenders, and then such amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by Borrower and all Lenders (other than any Defaulting Lender), do any of the following at any time: (a) change the number of Lenders that shall be required for Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder; (b) amend the definition of “Requisite Lenders”; (c) amend this

	Section 13.2

	; (d) reduce the amount of principal of, or interest on, or the interest rate applicable to, the Loan or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder; or (e) postpone any date on which any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loan or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder is required to be made; provided, further, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by (i) a Lender, change the Pro Rata Share or increase the Commitment of such Lender, (ii) the Agent, in addition to Lenders required above, to take any such action that affects the rights or duties of Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (iii) all Lenders (or by the Agent at their instruction), any change adverse to the Lenders affecting the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Borrowing Base (including the definitions used therein), the Eligible Loans (including the definitions used therein), or the provisions of

	Section 6.18

	(including the definitions used therein);


	provided, further, that notwithstanding clause (iii) in the immediately preceding proviso, as between Agent and Lenders, Agent shall be permitted to waive eligibility requirements with respect to proposed Eligible Loans in its reasonable discretion consistent with past practices without the consent of Requisite Lenders (it being understood that any such waiver shall be in Agent’s sole discretion as between Agent and Borrower).




	 




	 




	 


	110




	 




	 




	(b)     In the event Agent requests the consent of a Lender and does not receive a written denial thereof within five (5) Business Days after such Lender’s receipt of such request, then such Lender will be deemed to have given such consent so long as such request contained a notice stating that such failure to respond within five (5) Business Days would be deemed to be a consent by such Lender.




	 




	(c)     In the event Agent requests the consent of a Lender in a situation where such Lender’s consent would be required and such consent is denied, then Agent may, at its option, require such Lender to assign its interest in the Loans to Agent for a price equal to the then outstanding principal amount thereof due such Lender plus accrued and unpaid interest and fees due such Lender, which principal, interest and fees will be paid to Lender when collected from Borrower. In the event that Agent elects to require any Lender to assign its interest to Agent pursuant to this

	Section 13.2

	Agent will so notify such Lender in writing within forty-five (45) days following such Lender’s denial, and such Lender will assign its interest to Agent no later than five (5) calendar days following receipt of such notice.




	 




	(d)     If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of Requisite Lenders, the consent of the Requisite Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained being referred to herein as a “

	Non-Consenting Lender

	”), then the Borrower shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to replace each such Non-Consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more replacement Lenders pursuant to

	Section 13.7(d)

	so long as at the time of such replacement, each such replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination.




	 





	13.3     Set-off and Sharing of Payments





	 




	In addition to any rights and remedies now or hereafter granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, with the prior written consent of Agent and without notice to Borrower or any other Person other than Agent (such notice being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all (a) balances (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) held by such Lender at any of its offices for the account of Borrower (regardless of whether such balances are then due to any Borrower ), and (b) other Property at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or for the account of any Borrower, against and on account of any of the Obligations which are not paid when due;

	provided



	,



	that no Lender or any such holder shall exercise any such right without prior written notice to Agent. Any Lender that has exercised its right to set-off or otherwise has received any payment on account of the Obligations shall, to the extent the amount of any such set off or payment exceeds its Pro Rata Share of payments obtained by all of Lenders on account of such Obligations, purchase for cash (and the other Lenders or holders of the Loans shall sell) participations in each such other Lender’s or holder’s Pro Rata Share of Obligations as would be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess with each other Lenders or holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery. Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (y) any Lender or holder may exercise its right to set-off with respect to amounts in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the Obligations and may sell participations in such excess to other Lenders and holders, and (z) any Lender so purchasing a participation in the Loans made or other Obligations held by other Lenders may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers’ lien, counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans and other Obligations in the amount of such participation.





	 




	 




	 


	111




	 




	 





	13.4     Disbursement of Funds





	 




	Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, disburse funds to Borrower for the Advances requested. Each Lender shall reimburse Agent on demand for its Pro Rata Share of all funds disbursed on its behalf by Agent, or if Agent so requests, each Lender shall remit to Agent its Pro Rata Share of any Advance before Agent disburses such Advance to or on account of Borrower. If Agent so elects to require that funds be made available prior to disbursement to Borrower, Agent shall advise each Lender by telephone, telex or telecopy of the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such requested Advance no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Borrowing Date, and each such Lender shall pay Agent such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such requested Loan, in same day funds, by wire transfer to Agent’s account not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time). If Agent shall have disbursed funds to Borrower on behalf of any Lender and such Lender fails to pay the amount of its Pro Rata Share forthwith upon Agent’s demand, Agent shall promptly notify Borrower, and Borrower shall immediately repay such amount to Agent. Any repayment by Borrower required pursuant to this

	Section 13.4

	shall be without premium or penalty. Nothing in this

	Section 13.4

	or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the provisions of

	Section 13.5

	, shall be deemed to require Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Agent or Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.




	 





	13.5     Settlements; Payments; and Information





	 




	(a)     

	Advances; Payments; Interest and Fee Payments

	.




	 




	(i)     The amount of outstanding Loans pursuant to Advances may fluctuate from day to day through Agent’s disbursement of funds to or on account of, and receipt of funds from, Borrower. In order to minimize the frequency of transfers of funds between Agent and each Lender, notwithstanding terms to the contrary set forth in

	Section 13.4

	, Advances and repayments thereof may be settled according to the procedures described in

	Sections 13.5(a)(ii)

	and

	13.5(a)(iii)

	. Notwithstanding these procedures, each Lender’s obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Advances made by Agent to or on account of Borrower will commence on the date such Advances are made by Agent. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall obligate a Lender to make an Advance at any time any Default or Event of Default exists. All such payments will be made by such Lender without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.




	 




	 




	 


	112




	 




	 




	(ii)     Once each week, or more frequently (including daily), if Agent so elects (each such day being a “


	Settlement Date


	”), Agent will advise each Lender by 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day by telephone, telex or telecopy of the amount of each such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Advances. In the event payments are necessary to adjust the amount of such Lender’s share of the Advances to such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Advances, the party from which such payment is due will pay the other party, in same day funds, by wire transfer to the other’s account not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day following the Settlement Date.




	 




	(iii)     Not later than the first Business Day after the Payment Date of each month (“


	Interest Settlement Date


	”), Agent will advise each Lender by telephone or facsimile of the amount of interest and fees charged to and collected from Borrower for the preceding month in respect of the Loans. Provided that such Lender has made all payments required to be made by it under this Agreement and provided that Lender has not received its Pro Rata Share of interest and fees directly from Borrower, Agent will pay to such Lender, by wire transfer to such Lender’s account (as specified by such Lender on

	Schedule A

	of this Agreement as amended by such Lender from time to time after the date hereof pursuant to the notice provisions contained herein or in the applicable Lender Addition Agreement) not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the next Business Day following the Interest Settlement Date, such Lender’s share of such interest and fees.




	 




	(b)     

	Availability of Lenders’ Pro Rata Share

	.




	 




	(i)     Unless Agent has been notified by a Lender prior to any proposed Borrowing Date of such Lender’s intention not to fund its Pro Rata Share of an Advance, Agent may assume that such Lender will make such amount available to Agent on the proposed Borrowing Date or the Business Day following the next Settlement Date, as applicable;

	provided

	,

	however

	,


	that



	nothing contained in this Agreement shall obligate a Lender to make an Advance at any time any Default or Event of Default exists. If such amount is not, in fact, made available to Agent by such Lender when due, Agent will be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.





	 




	(ii)     Nothing contained in this

	Section 13.5(b)

	will be deemed to relieve a Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments or to prejudice any rights Agent, any other Lender or Borrower may have against such Lender as a result of any default by such Lender under this Agreement.




	 




	 




	 


	113




	 




	 




	(c)     

	Return of Payments

	.




	 




	(i)     If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Agent from any Borrower and such related payment is not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.




	 




	(ii)     If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement must be returned to any Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender. In addition, each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to Borrower or such other Person, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.




	 





	13.6     Dissemination of Information





	 




	Upon request by a Lender, Agent will distribute promptly to such Lender, unless previously provided by any Borrower to such Lender, copies of all notices, schedules, reports, projections, financial statements, agreements and other material and information, including, without limitation, financial and reporting information received from Borrower or generated by a third party (and excluding only internal information generated by Pacific Western for its own use as a Lender or as Agent and any attorney-client privileged communications or work product), as provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as received by Agent. Agent shall not be liable to any of Lenders for any failure to comply with its obligations under this

	Section 13.6

	, except to the extent that such failure is attributed to Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct and results in demonstrable damages to such Lender as determined, in each case, by a court of competent jurisdiction on a final and non-appealable basis.




	 





	13.7     Defaulting Lender





	 




	(a)     Agent may recover from a Defaulting Lender on demand the Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Loans made available by Agent on such Lender’s behalf that Defaulting Lender fails to pay to Agent or any other amount owing by a Defaulting Lender to Agent hereunder that such Defaulting Lender fails to pay to Agent.




	 




	(b)     The failure of any Lender to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Advance shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of such Advance. Conversely, no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of another Lender to fund such other Lender’s Pro Rata Share of an Advance.




	 




	(c)     Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrower to Agent for the Defaulting Lender’s benefit; nor shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder. Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrower the amount of all such payments received or retained by it for the account of such Defaulting Lender. For purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents and determining Pro Rata Shares, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and such Lender’s Commitment or Loans made by it, as applicable, for such purposes shall be deemed to be zero. This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender until (i) the Defaulting Lender has paid all amounts required to be paid to Agent hereunder or (ii) Borrower, the Requisite Lenders and Agent shall have waived such Lender’s default in writing. The operation of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender or to relieve or excuse the performance by Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder.




	 




	 




	 


	114




	 




	 




	(d)     If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in

	Section 12.2

	), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);

	provided



	,



	that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Agent which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, and (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts).  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if prior thereto the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.





	 





	13.8     Taxes





	 




	(a)     Subject to

	Section 13.8(g),

	any and all payments by or on account of any obligations of Borrower to each Lender or Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (including penalties, interest and additions to tax), imposed by any Governmental Authority, excluding, in the case of each Lender and Agent, (i) such taxes (including income taxes or franchise taxes) as are imposed on or measured by the net income, overall receipts or total capital of such Lender or Agent, respectively, by the jurisdiction in which such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, is organized or maintains a Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof, and (ii) any branch profits taxes imposed by the United States of America (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as “


	Taxes


	”).




	 




	(b)     In addition, Borrower shall pay to the relevant Governmental Authority any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as “


	Other Taxes


	”) not paid pursuant to

	Section 13.8(a)

	.




	 




	 




	 


	115




	 




	 




	(c)     Subject to

	Section 13.8(g),

	Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Lender and Agent for the full amount of any and all Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this

	Section 13.8

	) paid or payable by such Lender or Agent and any liability (other than any penalties, interest, additions, and expenses that accrue after the 180

	th

	day after the receipt by Agent or such Lender of written notice of the assertion of such Taxes or Other Taxes unless before the date that Agent or such Lender provides Borrower with a certificate relating thereto pursuant to

	Section 13.8(1

	)) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payments under this indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date any Lender or Agent makes written demand therefor.




	 




	(d)     If Borrower shall be required by applicable law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or Agent, then, subject to

	Section 13.8(g):





	 




	(i)     the sum payable shall be increased to the extent necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this

	Section 13.8

	), such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made;




	 




	(ii)     Borrower shall make such deductions; and




	 




	(iii)     Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.




	 




	(e)     As soon as practicable after the date of any payment by Borrower of Taxes or Other Taxes to a Governmental Authority, Borrower shall furnish to Agent (and the applicable Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of payment satisfactory to Agent (and the applicable Lender).




	 




	 




	 


	116




	 




	 




	(f)     Each Lender that is not a citizen or resident of the United States of America, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States (or any jurisdiction thereof), or any estate or trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income or is otherwise a “foreign person” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(c) (a “


	Non-U.S. Lender


	”) shall deliver to Borrower and Agent (or, in the case of an assignment that is not disclosed to Borrower in accordance with the provisions of

	Section 12.2

	, solely to the assigning Lender and Agent and not to Borrower) two (2) copies of each applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Form W-8IMY or Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from United States federal withholding tax on all payments by Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. In addition to properly completing and duly executing Forms W-8BEN or W-8IMY (or any subsequent versions thereof or successor thereto), if such Non-U.S. Lender is claiming an exemption from withholding of United States Federal income tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, such Lender hereby represents and warrants that (A) it is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c) of the Code, (B) it is not subject to regulatory or other legal requirements as a bank in any jurisdiction, (C) it has not been treated as a bank for purposes of any tax, securities law or other filing or submission made to any governmental securities law or other legal requirements, (D) it is not a “10 percent shareholder” within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code of Borrower, (E) it is not a controlled foreign corporation receiving interest from a related person within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (F) none of the interest arising from this Agreement constitutes contingent interest within the meaning of Section 871(h)(4) or Section 881(c)(4) of the Code and such Non-U.S. Lender agrees that it shall provide Agent, and Agent shall provide to Borrower (or, in the case of an assignment that is not disclosed to Borrower in accordance with the provisions of

	Section 12.2

	, solely to the assigning Lender and Agent and not to Borrower), with prompt notice at any time after becoming a Lender hereunder that it can no longer make the foregoing representations and warranties. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify Borrower (or, in the case of an assignment that is not disclosed to Borrower in accordance with the provisions of

	Section 12.2

	, solely to the assigning Lender and Agent and not to Borrower) at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered form or certificate (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to (x) comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or (y) determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this subsection that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. Each Lender who makes an assignment pursuant to

	Section 12.2

	where the assignment and assumption agreement is not delivered to Borrower shall indemnify and agree to hold Agent, Borrower and the other Lenders harmless from and against any United States federal withholding tax, interest and penalties that would not have been imposed but for (i) the failure of the Affiliate or the Related Fund that received such assignment under

	Section 12.2

	to comply with this

	Section 13.8(f)

	or (ii) the failure of such Lender to withhold and pay such tax at the proper rate in the event such Affiliate or Related Fund does not comply with this

	Section 13.8(f)

	(or complies with

	Section 13.8(f)

	but delivers forms indicating it is entitled to a reduced rate of such tax). Upon Borrower’s reasonable request, any Lender that is a U.S. Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Agent (i) a properly prepared and duly executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, certifying that such Lender is entitled to receive any and all payments under this Agreement and each other Loan Document free and clear from withholding of United States federal income taxes and (ii) such other reasonable documentation as will enable Borrower and/or Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Each Person that shall become a Participant pursuant to

	Section 12.2

	shall, on or before the date of the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements required pursuant to this

	Section 13.8(f)

	and

	Section 13.8(h),

	and shall make the representations and warranties set forth in

	clauses (A) — (F)

	above

	,



	;




	provided



	,



	that the obligations of such Participant, pursuant to this

	Section 13.8(f)

	and

	Section 13.8(h),

	shall be determined as if such Participant were a Lender except that such Participant shall furnish all such required forms, certifications and statements to Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.

	(g)     Borrower will not be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of United States Federal income tax pursuant to

	Section 13.8(d)

	to any Lender or Agent or to indemnify any Lender or Agent pursuant to

	Section 13.8(c)

	to the extent that (i) the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender to comply with its obligations under

	Section 13.8(f)

	for any reason; (ii) with respect to a Lender, the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to United Stated Federal income tax existed on the date such Lender became a party to this Agreement or, with respect to payments to a lending office newly designated by a Lender (a “


	New Lending Office


	”), the date such Lender designated such New Lending Office with respect to the applicable Loan;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that this

	clause (ii)

	shall not apply to the extent the additional amounts any Lender (or Transferee) through a New Lending Office, would be entitled to receive (without regard to this

	clause (ii))

	do not exceed the additional amounts that the Person making the transfer, or Lender (or Transferee) making the designation of such New Lending Office, would have been entitled to receive in the absence of such transfer or designation; (iii) the Internal Revenue Service has determined (which determination shall be final and non-appealable) that such Lender or Agent is treated as a “conduit entity” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.881-3 or any successor provision;

	provided

	,

	however

	,


	that



	nothing contained in this

	clause (iii)

	shall preclude the payment of additional amounts or indemnity payments by Borrower to the person for whom the “conduit entity” is acting; or (iv) such Lender is claiming an exemption from withholding of United States Federal income tax under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code but is unable at any time to make the representations and warranties set forth in

	clauses (A)


	(F)

	of

	Section 13.8(f)

	; or (v) any U.S. federal withholding taxes imposed under FATCA, including, for the avoidance of doubt, U.S. federal withholding taxes if imposed under FATCA as a result of a Lender’s failure to comply with legislation with respect to or implementing an intergovernmental agreement entered into by two or more Governmental Authorities with respect to FATCA.





	 




	(h)     Each Non-U.S. Lender agrees to provide Borrower and Agent, upon the reasonable request of Borrower, such other forms or documents as may be reasonably required under applicable law in order to establish an exemption from or eligibility for a reduction in the rate or imposition of Taxes or Other Taxes. If, at any time, Borrower requests any Lender to deliver any such additional forms or other documentation, then Borrower shall, on demand of such Lender through Agent, reimburse such Lender for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) reasonably incurred by such Lender in the preparation or delivery of such forms or other documentation.




	 




	(i)     If Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the account of any Lender or Agent pursuant to this

	Section 13.8

	, then such Lender or Agent shall use its reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by Borrower or to designate a Lending Office from a different jurisdiction (if such a Lending Office exists) so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payments by Borrower which may accrue in the future if such filing or changes in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or Agent, would not require such Lender to disclose information such Lender deems confidential and is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender or Agent.




	 




	 




	 


	118




	 




	 




	(j)     If Agent or a Lender, in its reasonable judgment, receives a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower or with respect to which Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this

	Section 13.8

	and no Default or Event of Default exists, it shall promptly pay to Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this

	Section 13.8

	with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund) and any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund

	,



	;




	provided

	, that Borrower, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, shall repay the amount paid over to Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to Agent or such Lender in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay the applicable refund to such Governmental Authority.





	 




	(k)     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Agent is required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes or any other taxes from or in respect of any sum payable to any Lender by Borrower or Agent, Agent shall not be required to make any gross-up payment to or in respect of such Lender, except to the extent that a corresponding gross-up payment is actually received by Agent from Borrower.




	 




	(l)     Any Lender claiming reimbursement or compensation pursuant to this

	Section 13.8

	shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy to Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable to such Lender hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower in the absence of manifest error.




	 




	(m)     The agreements and obligations of Borrower in this

	Section 13.8

	shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.




	 





	13.9     Inability to Determine Rates





	 




	If Agent determines that (i) for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate with respect to a proposed Advance, (ii) it is illegal or unlawful for to make or incur Advances based on the LIBOR Rate, or (iii) that the LIBOR Rate with respect to a proposed Advance does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Advance, Agent will promptly notify Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make Advances or maintain the Loan based on the LIBOR Rate shall be suspended until Agent revokes such notice in writing.




	 





	13.10     Patriot Act





	 




	Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the Patriot Act and Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Borrower, which information includes the name and address of Borrower and other information that will allow Agent and each Lender to identify Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. Borrower shall, promptly following a request by Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” an anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act.

	Annex I





	 





	LETTERS OF CREDIT





	 




	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Annex and of this Agreement, Agent may from time to time prior to the expiration of the Revolving Period cause the L/C Issuer to issue Standby Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the Lenders shall not issue or to cause to be issued any Standby Letters of Credit (i) to the extent that the issuance of such Standby Letters of Credit would then cause the sum of the outstanding Advances and all outstanding Letter of Credit Usage, to exceed the lesser of (

	x

	) the Maximum Loan Amount, and (

	y
