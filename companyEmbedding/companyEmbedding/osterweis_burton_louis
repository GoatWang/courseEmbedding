If the filing person has previously filed a statement on Schedule 13G to report
the acquisition which is the subject of this Schedule 13D, and is filing this
schedule because of Rule 13d-1(e), 13d-1(f) or 13d-1(g), check the following
box. [  ]

*        The remainder of this cover page shall be filled out for a reporting
         person's initial filing on this form with respect to the subject class
         of securities, and for any subsequent amendment containing information
         which would alter disclosures provided in a prior cover page.

The information required on the remainder of this cover page shall not be deemed
to be "filed" for the purpose of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 ("Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section of the Act
but shall be subject to all other provisions of the Act (however, see the
Notes).





Item 1.            Security and Issuer.

The securities that are the subject of this statement are common stock, par
value $.001 per share, of DLH HOLDINGS CORP., a New Jersey corporation (the
"Issuer"). The Issuer's principal executive offices are located at
 1776 Peachtree Street, NW, Atlanta, Georgia 30309.


Item 2.           Identity and Background.

This Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment") amends the Statement of
Beneficial Ownership on Schedule 13D, originally filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on September 18, 2015,
and as amended by an amendment also filed on September 18, 2015. This
statement is filed on behalf of  Burton L. Osterweis, a shareholder of
the Issuer. Mr. Osterweis' address is 27 Adams Street, Westborough,
Massachusetts 01581.

During the last five years, Mr. Osterweis was not convicted in a criminal
proceeding, was not a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or
administrative body of competent jurisdiction, and was not subject to a
judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting
or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding
any violation with respect to such laws.

Mr. Osterweis is a citizen of the United States of America.


Item 3.           Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

The securities that are the subject of this statement were acquired by Mr.
Osterweis with personal funds.


Item 4.           Purpose of Transaction.

Item 3 of this statement is incorporated herein by reference. Mr. Osterweis
purchased the securities that are the subject of this statement for his own
account, for investment purposes.

Depending on market conditions, general economic conditions, and other factors
that Mr. Osterweis may deem significant to his investment decision,
Mr. Osterweis may purchase shares of the Issuer's common stock in private
or market transactions or may dispose of all or a portion of the shares of
common stock that he currently owns or may hereafter
acquire from time to time.


Item 5.           Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

Hi, we’re Co-op Cycles

We’re bikes born from a love of adventure, cooperatively designed with REI members and built for riders who seek the fun and freedom that comes from exploring the world on two wheels.



























Mountain

When fat tires and dirt trails combine, it’s magic, plain and simple. These low-maintenance fun machines have proven technologies and upgradability that’ll let you dial in a ride all your own.




Explore mountain bikes





























All-road

Road bikes for the adventurous, who know the ride shouldn’t end just because the pavement does. These are built strong and light, providing true versatility from pavement to gravel and beyond.




Explore all-road bikes





























Adventure

Made for loaded tours in ever-changing terrain, these are the bikes from which great stories come. Each model is purpose-built, fully rackable and ready to roll wherever you want to take it.




Explore adventure bikes





























City

Ditch the car and start living, people. Commuting, errands, beer runs and nights out are all made better when done on two wheels. Being part of the solution has never been so much fun.




Explore city bikes





























Kids

When you're a kid, your bike is your freedom. Start 'em out right with sturdy and reliable bikes that will take them from training wheels to singletrack in no time.




Explore kids' bikes














BIKES WORTH RIDING

Adventure ready

Our bikes are adventure ready and built for versatility. Our members told us that their adventures don’t always fit into exact categories, so we made it easy to accessorize and upgrade.

























Built with great parts

We consciously choose high-quality components over just the latest-and-greatest tech. Meaning, spec-for-spec, our bikes are some of the best values around, and they’ll keep you riding happy for years.

























Cooperatively designed

We start our design process by talking with our riders. They tell us what matters most to them, and we use their feedback to build nothing but great bikes worth riding.
