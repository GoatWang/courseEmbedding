Dear «Sal»:

This letter is to inform you that on November 15, 2006 there will be a special meeting of contract holders of portfolios
within the following three Fidelity VIP Trusts: Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II
and Variable Insurance Products Fund III.  The portfolios in each trust include those listed in the table attached to this
letter. The purpose of these meetings is to consider and act upon the election of trustees.

Prior to the meetings, a proxy of contract holders of record at the close of business on September 18, 2006 will be
required.  Although Fidelity will incur the costs of the printing and mailing of the proxy statements in addition to the
tabulation of contract holder votes, your company will still need to be actively involved in the process.  Since we are still
in the planning stage, it would be beneficial to get some estimated quantities as soon as possible, so that we can order the
necessary number of statements for your policyholders.  Please refer to your participation agreement for questions
regarding your company's responsibilities.

We encourage you to utilize the services of MIS, an ADP Company, in Hingham, Massachusetts to handle the distribution
of the proxy materials to, and the tabulation of votes from, your contract holders.  MIS has been a Fidelity mutual fund
proxy solicitor for many years and is the nation's leading mailer and tabulator of variable product proxies as well.  MIS is
very knowledgeable in all areas of annuity proxy solicitation and will provide a turnkey service including all of the
proportional voting of your separate account share positions to Fidelity.

We know that many of the insurance companies that have separate accounts invested in Fidelity's Variable Insurance
Products already have existing business relationships with MIS. If you currently use MIS to manage your proxies, please
call Stephanie Camerlengo at 781-740-3431 at your earliest convenience to discuss the specifics of your portion of this
proxy.

If you are not familiar with MIS, Stephanie will be pleased to provide you with a complete outline of their services and a
cost estimate based on your needs. You will find MIS particularly helpful in assisting your data processing people with
organizing and submitting your contract holder data in the proper format.  Moreover, their ability to systematically
prepare all of your proportional voting summaries will save you considerable time and effort. Should you have any
qualms about sending your files to an outside service, then MIS will prepare and sign a confidentiality agreement for your
records.

Hopefully, you will consider using MIS for this process. However, if you have any additional questions or concerns,
please do not hesitate to contact me at 401-292-6344.

Sincerely,

/s/ Brian Haseltine

Brian Haseltine

Contract holders should read the proxy statement when it is available because it contains important information.  The
proxy statement will be available, without charge, from the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov)
or by contacting Fidelity at 800-522-7297.  The solicitation of proxies is being made on behalf of the Board of Trustees of
Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III.

 Semiannual Report


Shareholder Expense Example
As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, including redemption fees, and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees, distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other Fund expenses. This Example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in
dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period (January 1, 2011 to June 30,
2011).

Actual Expenses 

The first line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use
the information in this line, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account
value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line for a class
of the Fund under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period. The
estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate
of expenses you paid during the period would be higher, and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the
underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.
These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes 

The second line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical
expenses based on a Class' actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Class' actual return.
The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You
may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with
the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds. The estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other
expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher,
and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its
pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds. These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's
annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs. Therefore, the
second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In
addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

Semiannual Report


Notes to Financial Statements
For the period ended June 30, 2011 (Unaudited) 

1. Organization.

VIP Contrafund Portfolio (the Fund) is a fund of Variable Insurance Products Fund II (the Trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number
of shares. The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment
company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Shares of the Fund may only be purchased by insurance companies for the purpose of
funding variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts. The Fund offers the following classes of shares: Initial Class shares, Service Class
shares, Service Class 2 shares, Service Class 2R shares, and Investor Class shares. All classes have equal rights and voting privileges, except for
matters affecting a single class. Investment income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, the common expenses of the Fund, and
certain fund-level expense reductions, if any, are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class based on the relative net assets of each class to the total
net assets of the Fund. Each class differs with respect to transfer agent and distribution and service plan fees incurred. Certain expense reductions
may also differ by class.

2. Investments in Fidelity Central Funds.

The Fund invests in Fidelity Central Funds, which are open-end investment companies available only to other investment companies and accounts
managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) and its affiliates. The Fund's Schedule of Investments lists each of the Fidelity
Central Funds held as of period end, if any, as an investment of the Fund, but does not include the underlying holdings of each Fidelity Central
Fund. As an Investing Fund, the Fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of the expenses of the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.

The Money Market Central Funds seek preservation of capital and current income and are managed by Fidelity Investments Money Management,
Inc. (FIMM), an affiliate of FMR.

A complete unaudited list of holdings for each Fidelity Central Fund is available upon request or at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC) web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, the financial statements of the Fidelity Central Funds, are available on the SEC web site or upon
request.

3. Significant Accounting Policies.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP),
which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Subsequent events, if any, through the date that the financial statements were issued have been evaluated in the preparation of
the financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

Security Valuation. Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. The Fund uses independent
pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market prices or quotations are not readily available or
reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining
value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be
utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value (NAV) calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for
the same securities.

The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels as
shown below:

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments

Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, etc.)

Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available)

Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. The aggregate value of
investments by input level, as of June 30, 2011, as well as a roll forward of Level 3 securities, is included at the end of the Fund's Schedule of
Investments. Valuation techniques used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows:

Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or
official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last
quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), futures
contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are used and are categorized as Level
2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity
securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market activity and risk are used and are categorized as
Level 3 in the hierarchy.

Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. For U.S. government and government agency obligations, pricing services utilize matrix pricing which
considers yield

Security Valuation - continued

or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy.

When independent prices are unavailable or unreliable, debt securities may be valued utilizing pricing matrices which consider similar factors that
would be used by independent pricing services. These are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy but may be Level 3 depending on the
circumstances.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded and are
categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net
asset value each business day and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.

Foreign Currency. The Fund may use foreign currency contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign-denominated securities. Gains and losses
from these transactions may arise from changes in the value of the foreign currency or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts'
terms.

Foreign-denominated assets, including investment securities, and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate at period end.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and dividends received and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on investments are included with the net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain (loss) are disclosed separately.

Investment Transactions and Income. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund's investment holdings and NAV include trades executed
through the end of the last business day of the period. The NAV per share for processing shareholder transactions is calculated as of the close of
business of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time and includes trades executed through the end of the prior
business day. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost and may include proceeds received from litigation.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except for certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
passed, which are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are
recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Distributions received on securities that represent a return of capital or capital gain
are recorded as a reduction of cost of investments and/or as a realized gain. The Fund estimates the components of distributions received that may
be considered return of capital distributions or capital gain distributions. Interest income and distributions from the Fidelity Central Funds are
accrued as earned. Interest income includes coupon interest and amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld where recovery of such taxes is uncertain.

Expenses. Expenses directly attributable to a fund are charged to that fund. Expenses attributable to more than one fund are allocated among the
respective funds on the basis of relative net assets or other appropriate methods. Expense estimates are accrued in the period to which they relate
and adjustments are made when actual amounts are known.

Deferred Trustee Compensation. Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), independent Trustees may elect to defer receipt of a portion
of their annual compensation. Deferred amounts are invested in a cross-section of Fidelity funds, are marked-to-market and remain in the Fund
until distributed in accordance with the Plan. The investment of deferred amounts and the offsetting payable to the Trustees are included in the
accompanying Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders. Each year, the Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company,
including distributing substantially all of its taxable income and realized gains under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and filing its U.S.
federal tax return. As a result, no provision for income taxes is required. A fund's federal tax return is subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for a period of three years. Foreign taxes are provided for based on the Fund's understanding of the tax rules and rates that
exist in the foreign markets in which it invests.

Distributions are declared and recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gain distributions are declared separately for each
class. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent book-tax differences. These adjustments have no impact on net assets
or the results of operations. Temporary book-tax differences will reverse in a subsequent period.

Book-tax differences are primarily due to future transactions, foreign currency transactions, passive foreign investment companies (PFIC),
deferred trustees compensation, capital loss carryforwards and losses deferred due to wash sales and excise tax regulations.

Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders - continued

The federal tax cost of investment securities and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of period end were as follows:




Gross unrealized appreciation 



$  2,820,542,961





Gross unrealized depreciation 



 (603,990,219)





Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on securities and other investments 



$  2,216,552,742





Tax cost 



$  15,037,743,740




Under the recently enacted Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Act), the Fund will be permitted to carry forward
capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 22, 2010 for an unlimited period. However, any losses incurred during those
future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to any losses incurred in pre-enactment taxable years, which generally expire after eight
years from when they are incurred. Additionally, post-enactment capital losses that are carried forward will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses rather than being considered all short-term as under previous law. The Fund's first fiscal year end subject to the
Act will be December 31, 2011.

Trading (Redemption) Fees. Service Class 2 R shares held by investors less than 60 days are subject to a redemption fee equal to 1% of the net
asset value of shares redeemed. All redemption fees, which reduce the proceeds of the shareholder redemption, are retained by the Fund and
accounted for as an addition to paid in capital.

New Accounting Pronouncement. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
and IFRSs. The update changes the wording used to describe the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information
about fair value measurements. The update is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Management is
currently evaluating the impact of the update's adoption on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

4. Operating Policies.

Restricted Securities. The Fund may invest in securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. These securities generally
may be resold in transactions exempt from registration or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these securities may involve
time-consuming negotiations and expense, and prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult. Information regarding restricted securities is
included at the end of the Fund's Schedule of Investments.

5. Derivative Instruments.

Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments. The Fund used derivative instruments (derivatives), including futures contracts, in
order to meet its investment objectives. The strategy is to use derivatives to increase returns and to manage exposure to certain risks as defined
below. The success of any strategy involving derivatives depends on analysis of numerous economic factors, and if the strategies for investment do
not work as intended, the Fund may not achieve its objectives.

The Fund's use of derivatives increased or decreased its exposure to the following risk:




Equity Risk 



Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from
interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all
instruments traded in a market or market segment.




The Fund is also exposed to additional risks from investing in derivatives, such as liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk. Liquidity risk is the
risk that the Fund will be unable to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not be able to fulfill its obligation to the Fund. The Fund's maximum risk of loss from counterparty credit risk is generally the aggregate
unrealized appreciation and unpaid counterparty payments in excess of any collateral pledged by the counterparty to the Fund. Counterparty risk
related to exchange-traded futures contracts is minimal because of the protection provided by the exchange on which they trade. Derivatives
involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the amounts recognized in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Futures Contracts. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specified underlying instrument for a fixed price at a
specified future date. The Fund used futures contracts to manage its exposure to the stock market.

Upon entering into a futures contract, a fund is required to deposit either cash or securities (initial margin) with a clearing broker in an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the face value of the contract. Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily and subsequent payments (variation
margin) are made or received by a fund depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the futures contracts and are recorded as unrealized
appreciation or (depreciation). Realized gain or (loss) is recorded upon the expiration or closing of a futures contract.

5. Derivative Instruments - continued

Futures Contracts - continued

The underlying face amount at value of open futures contracts at period end is shown in the Schedule of Investments under the caption "Futures
Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's exposure to the underlying instrument at period end and is representative of activity for the
period. Securities deposited to meet initial margin requirements are identified in the Schedule of Investments. The receivable and/or payable for
the variation margin are reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Certain risks arise upon entering into futures contracts, including the risk that an illiquid market limits the ability to close out a futures contract
prior to settlement date.

During the period the Fund recognized net realized gain (loss) of $3,951,732 and a change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of
$2,499,092 related to its investment in futures contracts. These amounts are included in the Statement of Operations.

6. Purchases and Sales of Investments.

Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities, aggregated $12,379,886,770 and $12,964,981,350, respectively.

7. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates.

Management Fee. FMR and its affiliates provide the Fund with investment management related services for which the Fund pays a monthly
management fee. The management fee is the sum of an individual fund fee rate that is based on an annual rate of .30% of the Fund's average net
assets and a group fee rate that averaged .26% during the period. The group fee rate is based upon the average net assets of all the mutual funds
advised by FMR. The group fee rate decreases as assets under management increase and increases as assets under management decrease. For the
period, the total annualized management fee rate was .56% of the Fund's average net assets.

Distribution and Service Plan Fees. In accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act, the Fund has adopted separate 12b-1 Plans for each Service
Class of shares. Each Service Class pays Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), an affiliate of FMR, a service fee. For the period, the service fee is
based on an annual rate of .10% of Service Class' average net assets and .25% of Service Class 2's and Service Class 2R's average net assets.

For the period, total fees, all of which were re-allowed to insurance companies for the distribution of shares and providing shareholder support
services were as follows:




Service Class 



$  710,767





Service Class 2 



  9,845,534





Service Class 2 R 



 13,716





 



$  10,570,017




Transfer Agent Fees. Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. (FIIOC), an affiliate of FMR, is the Fund's transfer, dividend
disbursing, and shareholder servicing agent. FIIOC receives an asset-based fee with respect to each class. Each class (with the exception of
Investor Class) pays a transfer agent fee, excluding out of pocket expenses, equal to an annual rate of .07% of average net assets. Investor Class
pays a monthly asset-based transfer agent fee of .15% of average net assets. In addition, FIIOC receives an asset-based fee of .0045% of average net
assets for typesetting, printing and mailing of shareholder reports, except proxy statements. For the period, transfer agent fees for each class,
including printing and out of pocket expenses, were as follows:




Initial Class 



$  2,642,373





Service Class 



  514,357





Service Class 2 



  2,840,109





Service Class 2R 



  3,942





Investor Class 



 485,252





 



$  6,486,033




Accounting and Security Lending Fees. Fidelity Service Company, Inc. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, maintains the Fund's accounting records.
The accounting fee is based on the level of average net assets for the month. Under a separate contract, FSC administers the security lending
program. The security lending fee is based on the number and duration of lending transactions.

Brokerage Commissions. The Fund placed a portion of its portfolio transactions with brokerage firms which are affiliates of the investment adviser. The commission paid to these affiliated firms were $612,966 for the period.

Semiannual Report

8. Committed Line of Credit.

The Fund participates with other funds managed by FMR or an affiliate in a $4.0 billion credit facility (the "line of credit") to be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes to fund shareholder redemptions or for other short-term liquidity purposes. The Fund has agreed to pay commitment
fees on its pro-rata portion of the line of credit, which amounted to $29,716 and is reflected in Miscellaneous expenses on the Statement of Operations. During the period, there were no borrowings on this line of credit.

9. Security Lending. 

The Fund lends portfolio securities through a lending agent from time to time in order to earn additional income. The lending agent may loan
securities to certain qualified borrowers, including Fidelity Capital Markets (FCM), a broker-dealer affiliated with the Fund. On the settlement
date of the loan, the Fund receives collateral (in the form of U.S. Treasury obligations, letters of credit and/or cash) against the loaned securities
and maintains collateral in an amount not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned securities during the period of the loan. The market
value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on
the next business day. If the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons, a fund could
experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral. Any cash collateral received is invested in the
Fidelity Securities Lending Cash Central Fund. The value of loaned securities and cash collateral at period end are disclosed on the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At period end, there were no security loans outstanding with FCM. Security lending income represents the income
earned on investing cash collateral, less rebates paid to borrowers and lending agent fees associated with the loan, plus any premium payments
received for lending certain types of securities. Security lending income is presented in the Statement of Operations as a component of income
from Fidelity Central Funds. Total security lending income during the period amounted to $1,117,070, including $5,467 from securities loaned to

13. Other.

The Fund's organizational documents provide former and current trustees and officers with a limited indemnification against liabilities arising in
connection with the performance of their duties to the Fund. In the normal course of business, the Fund may also enter into contracts that provide
general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that
may be made against the Fund. The risk of material loss from such claims is considered remote.

At the end of the period, two otherwise unaffiliated shareholders were the owners of 29% of the total outstanding shares of the Fund.

Shareholder Expense Example
As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, including redemption fees, and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees, distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other Fund expenses. This Example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in
dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period (January 1, 2011 to June 30,
2011).

Actual Expenses 

The first line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use
the information in this line, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account
value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line for a class
of the Fund under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period. The
estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate
of expenses you paid during the period would be higher, and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the
underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.
These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes 

The second line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical
expenses based on a Class' actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Class' actual return.
The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You
may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with
the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds. The estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other
expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher,
and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its
pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds. These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's
annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs. Therefore, the
second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In
addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

Semiannual Report


Notes to Financial Statements
For the period ended June 30, 2011 (Unaudited) 

1. Organization.

VIP Contrafund Portfolio (the Fund) is a fund of Variable Insurance Products Fund II (the Trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number
of shares. The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment
company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Shares of the Fund may only be purchased by insurance companies for the purpose of
funding variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts. The Fund offers the following classes of shares: Initial Class shares, Service Class
shares, Service Class 2 shares, Service Class 2R shares, and Investor Class shares. All classes have equal rights and voting privileges, except for
matters affecting a single class. Investment income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, the common expenses of the Fund, and
certain fund-level expense reductions, if any, are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class based on the relative net assets of each class to the total
net assets of the Fund. Each class differs with respect to transfer agent and distribution and service plan fees incurred. Certain expense reductions
may also differ by class.

2. Investments in Fidelity Central Funds.

The Fund invests in Fidelity Central Funds, which are open-end investment companies available only to other investment companies and accounts
managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) and its affiliates. The Fund's Schedule of Investments lists each of the Fidelity
Central Funds held as of period end, if any, as an investment of the Fund, but does not include the underlying holdings of each Fidelity Central
Fund. As an Investing Fund, the Fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of the expenses of the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.

The Money Market Central Funds seek preservation of capital and current income and are managed by Fidelity Investments Money Management,
Inc. (FIMM), an affiliate of FMR.

A complete unaudited list of holdings for each Fidelity Central Fund is available upon request or at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC) web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, the financial statements of the Fidelity Central Funds, are available on the SEC web site or upon
request.

3. Significant Accounting Policies.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP),
which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Subsequent events, if any, through the date that the financial statements were issued have been evaluated in the preparation of
the financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

Security Valuation. Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. The Fund uses independent
pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market prices or quotations are not readily available or
reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining
value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be
utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value (NAV) calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for
the same securities.

The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels as
shown below:

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments

Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, etc.)

Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available)

Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. The aggregate value of
investments by input level, as of June 30, 2011, as well as a roll forward of Level 3 securities, is included at the end of the Fund's Schedule of
Investments. Valuation techniques used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows:

Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or
official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last
quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), futures
contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are used and are categorized as Level
2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity
securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market activity and risk are used and are categorized as
Level 3 in the hierarchy.

Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. For U.S. government and government agency obligations, pricing services utilize matrix pricing which
considers yield

Security Valuation - continued

or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy.

When independent prices are unavailable or unreliable, debt securities may be valued utilizing pricing matrices which consider similar factors that
would be used by independent pricing services. These are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy but may be Level 3 depending on the
circumstances.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded and are
categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net
asset value each business day and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.

Foreign Currency. The Fund may use foreign currency contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign-denominated securities. Gains and losses
from these transactions may arise from changes in the value of the foreign currency or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts'
terms.

Foreign-denominated assets, including investment securities, and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate at period end.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and dividends received and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The effects of exchange rate fluctuations on investments are included with the net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain (loss) are disclosed separately.

Investment Transactions and Income. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund's investment holdings and NAV include trades executed
through the end of the last business day of the period. The NAV per share for processing shareholder transactions is calculated as of the close of
business of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time and includes trades executed through the end of the prior
business day. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost and may include proceeds received from litigation.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except for certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
passed, which are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are
recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Distributions received on securities that represent a return of capital or capital gain
are recorded as a reduction of cost of investments and/or as a realized gain. The Fund estimates the components of distributions received that may
be considered return of capital distributions or capital gain distributions. Interest income and distributions from the Fidelity Central Funds are
accrued as earned. Interest income includes coupon interest and amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld where recovery of such taxes is uncertain.

Expenses. Expenses directly attributable to a fund are charged to that fund. Expenses attributable to more than one fund are allocated among the
respective funds on the basis of relative net assets or other appropriate methods. Expense estimates are accrued in the period to which they relate
and adjustments are made when actual amounts are known.

Deferred Trustee Compensation. Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), independent Trustees may elect to defer receipt of a portion
of their annual compensation. Deferred amounts are invested in a cross-section of Fidelity funds, are marked-to-market and remain in the Fund
until distributed in accordance with the Plan. The investment of deferred amounts and the offsetting payable to the Trustees are included in the
accompanying Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders. Each year, the Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company,
including distributing substantially all of its taxable income and realized gains under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and filing its U.S.
federal tax return. As a result, no provision for income taxes is required. A fund's federal tax return is subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for a period of three years. Foreign taxes are provided for based on the Fund's understanding of the tax rules and rates that
exist in the foreign markets in which it invests.

Distributions are declared and recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gain distributions are declared separately for each
class. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent book-tax differences. These adjustments have no impact on net assets
or the results of operations. Temporary book-tax differences will reverse in a subsequent period.

Book-tax differences are primarily due to future transactions, foreign currency transactions, passive foreign investment companies (PFIC),
deferred trustees compensation, capital loss carryforwards and losses deferred due to wash sales and excise tax regulations.

Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders - continued

The federal tax cost of investment securities and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of period end were as follows:




Gross unrealized appreciation 



$  2,820,542,961





Gross unrealized depreciation 



 (603,990,219)





Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on securities and other investments 



$  2,216,552,742





Tax cost 



$  15,037,743,740




Under the recently enacted Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Act), the Fund will be permitted to carry forward
capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 22, 2010 for an unlimited period. However, any losses incurred during those
future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to any losses incurred in pre-enactment taxable years, which generally expire after eight
years from when they are incurred. Additionally, post-enactment capital losses that are carried forward will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses rather than being considered all short-term as under previous law. The Fund's first fiscal year end subject to the
Act will be December 31, 2011.

Trading (Redemption) Fees. Service Class 2 R shares held by investors less than 60 days are subject to a redemption fee equal to 1% of the net
asset value of shares redeemed. All redemption fees, which reduce the proceeds of the shareholder redemption, are retained by the Fund and
accounted for as an addition to paid in capital.

New Accounting Pronouncement. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
and IFRSs. The update changes the wording used to describe the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information
about fair value measurements. The update is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Management is
currently evaluating the impact of the update's adoption on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

4. Operating Policies.

Restricted Securities. The Fund may invest in securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. These securities generally
may be resold in transactions exempt from registration or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these securities may involve
time-consuming negotiations and expense, and prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult. Information regarding restricted securities is
included at the end of the Fund's Schedule of Investments.

5. Derivative Instruments.

Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments. The Fund used derivative instruments (derivatives), including futures contracts, in
order to meet its investment objectives. The strategy is to use derivatives to increase returns and to manage exposure to certain risks as defined
below. The success of any strategy involving derivatives depends on analysis of numerous economic factors, and if the strategies for investment do
not work as intended, the Fund may not achieve its objectives.

The Fund's use of derivatives increased or decreased its exposure to the following risk:




Equity Risk 



Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from
interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all
instruments traded in a market or market segment.




The Fund is also exposed to additional risks from investing in derivatives, such as liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk. Liquidity risk is the
risk that the Fund will be unable to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not be able to fulfill its obligation to the Fund. The Fund's maximum risk of loss from counterparty credit risk is generally the aggregate
unrealized appreciation and unpaid counterparty payments in excess of any collateral pledged by the counterparty to the Fund. Counterparty risk
related to exchange-traded futures contracts is minimal because of the protection provided by the exchange on which they trade. Derivatives
involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the amounts recognized in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Futures Contracts. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specified underlying instrument for a fixed price at a
specified future date. The Fund used futures contracts to manage its exposure to the stock market.

Upon entering into a futures contract, a fund is required to deposit either cash or securities (initial margin) with a clearing broker in an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the face value of the contract. Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily and subsequent payments (variation
margin) are made or received by a fund depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the futures contracts and are recorded as unrealized
appreciation or (depreciation). Realized gain or (loss) is recorded upon the expiration or closing of a futures contract.

5. Derivative Instruments - continued

Futures Contracts - continued

The underlying face amount at value of open futures contracts at period end is shown in the Schedule of Investments under the caption "Futures
Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's exposure to the underlying instrument at period end and is representative of activity for the
period. Securities deposited to meet initial margin requirements are identified in the Schedule of Investments. The receivable and/or payable for
the variation margin are reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Certain risks arise upon entering into futures contracts, including the risk that an illiquid market limits the ability to close out a futures contract
prior to settlement date.

During the period the Fund recognized net realized gain (loss) of $3,951,732 and a change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of
$2,499,092 related to its investment in futures contracts. These amounts are included in the Statement of Operations.

6. Purchases and Sales of Investments.

Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities, aggregated $12,379,886,770 and $12,964,981,350, respectively.

7. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates.

Management Fee. FMR and its affiliates provide the Fund with investment management related services for which the Fund pays a monthly
management fee. The management fee is the sum of an individual fund fee rate that is based on an annual rate of .30% of the Fund's average net
assets and a group fee rate that averaged .26% during the period. The group fee rate is based upon the average net assets of all the mutual funds
advised by FMR. The group fee rate decreases as assets under management increase and increases as assets under management decrease. For the
period, the total annualized management fee rate was .56% of the Fund's average net assets.

Distribution and Service Plan Fees. In accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act, the Fund has adopted separate 12b-1 Plans for each Service
Class of shares. Each Service Class pays Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), an affiliate of FMR, a service fee. For the period, the service fee is
based on an annual rate of .10% of Service Class' average net assets and .25% of Service Class 2's and Service Class 2R's average net assets.

For the period, total fees, all of which were re-allowed to insurance companies for the distribution of shares and providing shareholder support
services were as follows:




Service Class 



$  710,767





Service Class 2 



  9,845,534





Service Class 2 R 



 13,716





 



$  10,570,017




Transfer Agent Fees. Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. (FIIOC), an affiliate of FMR, is the Fund's transfer, dividend
disbursing, and shareholder servicing agent. FIIOC receives an asset-based fee with respect to each class. Each class (with the exception of
Investor Class) pays a transfer agent fee, excluding out of pocket expenses, equal to an annual rate of .07% of average net assets. Investor Class
pays a monthly asset-based transfer agent fee of .15% of average net assets. In addition, FIIOC receives an asset-based fee of .0045% of average net
assets for typesetting, printing and mailing of shareholder reports, except proxy statements. For the period, transfer agent fees for each class,
including printing and out of pocket expenses, were as follows:




Initial Class 



$  2,642,373





Service Class 



  514,357





Service Class 2 



  2,840,109





Service Class 2R 



  3,942





Investor Class 



 485,252





 



$  6,486,033




Accounting and Security Lending Fees. Fidelity Service Company, Inc. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, maintains the Fund's accounting records.
The accounting fee is based on the level of average net assets for the month. Under a separate contract, FSC administers the security lending
program. The security lending fee is based on the number and duration of lending transactions.

Brokerage Commissions. The Fund placed a portion of its portfolio transactions with brokerage firms which are affiliates of the investment adviser. The commission paid to these affiliated firms were $612,966 for the period.

Semiannual Report

8. Committed Line of Credit.

The Fund participates with other funds managed by FMR or an affiliate in a $4.0 billion credit facility (the "line of credit") to be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes to fund shareholder redemptions or for other short-term liquidity purposes. The Fund has agreed to pay commitment
fees on its pro-rata portion of the line of credit, which amounted to $29,716 and is reflected in Miscellaneous expenses on the Statement of Operations. During the period, there were no borrowings on this line of credit.

9. Security Lending. 

The Fund lends portfolio securities through a lending agent from time to time in order to earn additional income. The lending agent may loan
securities to certain qualified borrowers, including Fidelity Capital Markets (FCM), a broker-dealer affiliated with the Fund. On the settlement
date of the loan, the Fund receives collateral (in the form of U.S. Treasury obligations, letters of credit and/or cash) against the loaned securities
and maintains collateral in an amount not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned securities during the period of the loan. The market
value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on
the next business day. If the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons, a fund could
experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral. Any cash collateral received is invested in the
Fidelity Securities Lending Cash Central Fund. The value of loaned securities and cash collateral at period end are disclosed on the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At period end, there were no security loans outstanding with FCM. Security lending income represents the income
earned on investing cash collateral, less rebates paid to borrowers and lending agent fees associated with the loan, plus any premium payments
received for lending certain types of securities. Security lending income is presented in the Statement of Operations as a component of income
from Fidelity Central Funds. Total security lending income during the period amounted to $1,117,070, including $5,467 from securities loaned to
FCM.

10. Expense Reductions. 

Many of the brokers with whom FMR places trades on behalf of the Fund provided services to the Fund in addition to trade execution. These
services included payments of certain expenses on behalf of the Fund totaling $1,664,395 for the period.

11. Distributions to Shareholders.

13. Other.

The Fund's organizational documents provide former and current trustees and officers with a limited indemnification against liabilities arising in
connection with the performance of their duties to the Fund. In the normal course of business, the Fund may also enter into contracts that provide
general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that
may be made against the Fund. The risk of material loss from such claims is considered remote.

At the end of the period, two otherwise unaffiliated shareholders were the owners of 29% of the total outstanding shares of the Fund.

Shareholder Expense Example
As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees, distribution
and/or service (12b-1) fees and other Fund expenses. This Example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in
the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period (January 1, 2011 to June 30,
2011).

Actual Expenses 

The first line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use
the information in this line, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account
value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line for a class
of the Fund under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period. The
estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate
of expenses you paid during the period would be higher, and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the
underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.
These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes 

The second line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical
expenses based on a Class' actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Class' actual return.
The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You
may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with
the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds. The estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other
expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher,
and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its
pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds. These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's
annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs. Therefore, the
second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds.

Semiannual Report


Notes to Financial Statements
For the period ended June 30, 2011 (Unaudited) 

1. Organization.

VIP Disciplined Small Cap Portfolio (the Fund) is a fund of Variable Insurance Products Fund II (the Trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares. The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management
investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Shares of the Fund may only be purchased by insurance companies for the
purpose of funding variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts. The Fund offers the following classes of shares: Initial Class shares,
Service Class shares, Service Class 2 shares and Investor Class shares. All classes have equal rights and voting privileges, except for matters
affecting a single class. Investment income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, the common expenses of the Fund, and certain
fund-level expense reductions, if any, are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class based on the relative net assets of each class to the total net
assets of the Fund. Each class differs with respect to transfer agent and distribution and service plan fees incurred. Certain expense reductions
may also differ by class.

2. Investments in Fidelity Central Funds.

The Fund may invest in Fidelity Central Funds, which are open-end investment companies available only to other investment companies and
accounts managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) and its affiliates. The Fund's Schedule of Investments lists each of the
Fidelity Central Funds held as of period end, if any, as an investment of the Fund, but does not include the underlying holdings of each Fidelity
Central Fund. As an Investing Fund, the Fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of the expenses of the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.

The Money Market Central Funds seek preservation of capital and current income and are managed by Fidelity Investments Money Management,
Inc. (FIMM), an affiliate of FMR.

A complete unaudited list of holdings for each Fidelity Central Fund is available upon request or at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC) web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, the financial statements of the Fidelity Central Funds, are available on the SEC web site or upon
request.

3. Significant Accounting Policies.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP),
which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Subsequent events, if any, through the date that the financial statements were issued have been evaluated in the preparation of
the financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

Security Valuation. Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. The Fund uses independent
pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market prices or quotations are not readily available or
reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining
value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be
utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value (NAV) calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for
the same securities.

The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels as
shown below:

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments

Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, etc.)

Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available)

Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. The aggregate value of
investments by input level, as of June 30, 2011, is included at the end of the Fund's Schedule of Investments. Valuation techniques used to value the
Fund's investments by major category are as follows:

Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or
official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last
quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), futures
contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are used and are categorized as Level
2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity
securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market activity and risk are used and are categorized as
Level 3 in the hierarchy.

Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. For U.S. government and government agency obligations, pricing services utilize matrix pricing which
considers yield

or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded and are
categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Investments in open-end mutual funds, including Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net
asset value each business day and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.

Investment Transactions and Income. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund's investment holdings and NAV include trades executed
through the end of the last business day of the period. The NAV per share for processing shareholder transactions is calculated as of the close of
business of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time and includes trades executed through the end of the prior
business day. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend
date, except for certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed, which are recorded as soon as the Fund is
informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the securities
received. Distributions received on securities that represent a return of capital or capital gain are recorded as a reduction of cost of investments
and/or as a realized gain. The Fund estimates the components of distributions received that may be considered return of capital distributions or
capital gain distributions. Interest income and distributions from the Fidelity Central Funds are accrued as earned. Interest income includes
coupon interest and amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes
withheld where recovery of such taxes is uncertain.

Expenses. Expenses directly attributable to a fund are charged to that fund. Expenses attributable to more than one fund are allocated among the
respective funds on the basis of relative net assets or other appropriate methods. Expense estimates are accrued in the period to which they relate
and adjustments are made when actual amounts are known.

Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders. Each year, the Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company,
including distributing substantially all of its taxable income and realized gains under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and filing its U.S.
federal tax return. As a result, no provision for income taxes is required. A fund's federal tax return is subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for a period of three years. Foreign taxes are provided for based on the Fund's understanding of the tax rules and rates that
exist in the foreign markets in which it invests.

Distributions are declared and recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gain distributions are declared separately for each
class. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent book-tax differences. These adjustments have no impact on net assets
or the results of operations. Temporary book-tax differences will reverse in a subsequent period.

Book-tax differences are primarily due to futures transactions, foreign currency transactions, market discount, capital loss carryforwards and
losses deferred due to wash sales and excise tax regulations.

The federal tax cost of investment securities and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of period end were as follows:




Gross unrealized appreciation 



$  15,322,428





Gross unrealized depreciation 



 (2,509,477)





Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on securities and other investments 



$  12,812,951





Tax cost 



$  97,817,370




Under the recently enacted Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Act), the Fund will be permitted to carry forward
capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 22, 2010 for an unlimited period. However, any losses incurred during those
future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to any losses incurred in pre-enactment taxable years, which generally expire after eight
years from when they are incurred. Additionally, post-enactment capital losses that are carried forward will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses rather than being considered all short-term as under previous law. The Fund's first fiscal year end subject to the
Act will be December 31, 2011.

New Accounting Pronouncement. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
and IFRSs. The update changes the wording used to describe the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information
about fair value measurements. The update is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Management is
currently evaluating the impact of the update's adoption on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

4. Derivative Instruments.

Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments. The Fund used derivative instruments (derivatives), including futures contracts in
order to meet its investment objectives. The strategy is to use derivatives to increase returns, to gain exposure to certain types of assets and to
manage exposure to certain risks as defined below. The success of any strategy involving derivatives depends on analysis of numerous economic
factors, and if the strategies for investment do not work as intended, the Fund may not achieve its objectives.

The Fund's use of derivatives increased or decreased its exposure to the following risk:




Equity Risk



Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from
interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all
instruments traded in a market or market segment.




The Fund is also exposed to additional risks from investing in derivatives, such as liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk. Liquidity risk is the
risk that the Fund will be unable to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not be able to fulfill its obligation to the Fund. The Fund's maximum risk of loss from counterparty credit risk is generally the aggregate
unrealized appreciation and unpaid counterparty payments in excess of any collateral pledged by the counterparty to the Fund. Counterparty risk
related to exchange-traded futures contracts is minimal because of the protection provided by the exchange on which they trade. Derivatives
involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the amounts recognized in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Futures Contracts. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specified underlying instrument for a fixed price at a
specified future date. The Fund used futures contracts to manage its exposure to the stock market.

Upon entering into a futures contract, a fund is required to deposit either cash or securities (initial margin) with a clearing broker in an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the face value of the contract. Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily and subsequent payments (variation
margin) are made or received by a fund depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the futures contracts and are recorded as unrealized
appreciation or (depreciation). Realized gain or (loss) is recorded upon the expiration or closing of a futures contract.

The underlying face amount at value of open futures contracts at period end is shown in the Schedule of Investments under the caption "Futures
Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's exposure to the underlying instrument at period end and is representative of activity for the
period. Securities deposited to meet initial margin requirements are identified in the Schedule of Investments. The receivable and/or payable for
the variation margin are reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Certain risks arise upon entering into futures contracts, including the risk that an illiquid market limits the ability to close out a futures contract
prior to settlement date.

During the period the Fund recognized net realized gain (loss) of $398,641 and a change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of
$(73,544) related to its investment in futures contracts. These amounts are included in the Statement of Operations.

5. Purchases and Sales of Investments.

Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities, aggregated $53,581,112 and $37,848,439, respectively.

6. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates.

Management Fee. FMR and its affiliates provide the Fund with investment management related services for which the Fund pays a monthly
management fee. The management fee is the sum of an individual fund fee rate that is based on an annual rate of .45% of the Fund's average net
assets and a group fee rate that averaged .26% during the period. The group fee rate is based upon the average net assets of all the mutual funds
advised by FMR. The group fee rate decreases as assets under management increase and increases as assets under management decrease. For the
period, the total annualized management fee rate was .71% of the Fund's average net assets.

Sub-Adviser. Geode Capital Management, LLC (Geode), serves as sub-adviser for the Fund. Geode provides discretionary investment advisory
services to the Fund and is paid by FMR for providing these services.

Distribution and Service Plan Fees. In accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act, the Fund has adopted separate 12b-1 Plans for each Service
Class of shares. Each Service Class pays Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), an affiliate of FMR, a service fee. For the period, the service fee is
based on an annual rate of .10% of Service Class' average net assets and .25% of Service Class 2's average net assets.

$  2,907




Transfer Agent Fees. Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. (FIIOC), an affiliate of FMR, is the Fund's transfer, dividend
disbursing, and shareholder servicing agent. FIIOC receives an asset-based fee with respect to each class. Each class (with the exception of
Investor Class) pays a transfer agent fee, excluding out of pocket expenses, equal to an annual rate of .07% of average net assets. Investor Class
pays a monthly asset-based transfer agent fee of .15% of average net assets. In addition, FIIOC receives an asset-based fee of .0045% of average net
assets for typesetting, printing and mailing of shareholder reports, except proxy statements. For the period, transfer agent fees for each class,
including printing and out of pocket expenses, were as follows:




Initial Class 



$  9,792





Service Class 



  135





Service Class 2 



  1,780





Investor Class 



 47,169





 



$  58,876




Accounting and Security Lending Fees. Fidelity Service Company, Inc. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, maintains the Fund's accounting records.
The accounting fee is based on the level of average net assets for the month. Under a separate contract, FSC administers the security lending
program. The security lending fee is based on the number and duration of lending transactions.

7. Committed Line of Credit.

The Fund participates with other funds managed by FMR or an affiliate in a $4.0 billion credit facility (the "line of credit") to be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes to fund shareholder redemptions or for other short-term liquidity purposes. The Fund has agreed to pay commitment
fees on its pro-rata portion of the line of credit, which amounted to $121 and is reflected in Miscellaneous expenses on the Statement of Operations.
During the period, there were no borrowings on this line of credit.

8. Security Lending. 

The Fund lends portfolio securities through a lending agent from time to time in order to earn additional income. The lending agent may loan
securities to certain qualified borrowers, including Fidelity Capital Markets (FCM), a broker-dealer affiliated with the Fund. On the settlement
date of the loan, the Fund receives collateral (in the form of U.S. Treasury obligations, letters of credit and/or cash) against the loaned securities
and maintains collateral in an amount not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned securities during the period of the loan. The market
value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on
the next business day. If the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons, a fund could
experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral. Any cash collateral received is invested in the
Fidelity Securities Lending Cash Central Fund. The value of loaned securities and cash collateral at period end are disclosed on the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Security lending income represents the income earned on investing cash collateral, less rebates paid to borrowers
and lending agent fees associated with the loan, plus any premium payments received for lending certain types of securities. Security lending
income is presented in the Statement of Operations as a component of income from Fidelity Central Funds. During the period, there were no
securities loaned to FCM.

11. Other.

The Fund's organizational documents provide former and current trustees and officers with a limited indemnification against liabilities arising in
connection with the performance of their duties to the Fund. In the normal course of business, the Fund may also enter into contracts that provide
general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that
may be made against the Fund. The risk of material loss from such claims is considered remote.

At the end of the period, FMR or its affiliates were the owners of record of 98% of the total outstanding shares of the Fund.

Shareholder Expense Example
As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees, distribution
and/or service (12b-1) fees and other Fund expenses. This Example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in
the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period (January 1, 2011 to June 30,
2011).

Actual Expenses 

The first line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use
the information in this line, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account
value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line for a class
of the Fund under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period. The
estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate
of expenses you paid during the period would be higher, and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the
underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.
These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes 

The second line of the accompanying table for each class of the Fund provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical
expenses based on a Class' actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Class' actual return.
The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You
may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with
the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds. The estimate of expenses does not include any fees or other
expenses of any variable annuity or variable life insurance product. If they were, the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher,
and your ending account value would be lower. In addition, the Fund, as a shareholder in the underlying Fidelity Central Funds, will indirectly bear its
pro-rata share of the fees and expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity Central Funds. These fees and expenses are not included in the Fund's
annualized expense ratio used to calculate the expense estimate in the table below.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs. Therefore, the
second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds.

Notes to Financial Statements
For the period ended June 30, 2011 (Unaudited) 

1. Organization.

VIP Index 500 Portfolio (the Fund) is a fund of Variable Insurance Products Fund II (the Trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of
shares. The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment
company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Shares of the Fund may only be purchased by insurance companies for the purpose of
funding variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts. The Fund offers the following classes of shares: Initial Class shares, Service Class
shares and Service Class 2 shares. All classes have equal rights and voting privileges, except for matters affecting a single class. Investment income,
realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, the common expenses of the Fund, and certain fund-level expense reductions, if any, are allocated
on a pro-rata basis to each class based on the relative net assets of each class to the total net assets of the Fund. Each class differs with respect to
distribution and service plan fees incurred. Certain expense reductions may also differ by class.

2. Investments in Fidelity Central Funds.

The Fund invests in Fidelity Central Funds, which are open-end investment companies available only to other investment companies and accounts
managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) and its affiliates. The Fund's Schedule of Investments lists each of the Fidelity
Central Funds held as of period end, if any, as an investment of the Fund, but does not include the underlying holdings of each Fidelity Central
Fund. As an Investing Fund, the Fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of the expenses of the underlying Fidelity Central Funds.

The Money Market Central Funds seek preservation of capital and current income and are managed by Fidelity Investments Money Management,
Inc. (FIMM), an affiliate of FMR.

A complete unaudited list of holdings for each Fidelity Central Fund is available upon request or at the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC) web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, the financial statements of the Fidelity Central Funds, are available on the SEC web site or upon
request.

3. Significant Accounting Policies.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP),
which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Subsequent events, if any, through the date that the financial statements were issued have been evaluated in the preparation of
the financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

Security Valuation. Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. The Fund uses independent
pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market prices or quotations are not readily available or
reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining
value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be
utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value (NAV) calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for
the same securities.

The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels as
shown below:

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments

Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, etc.)

Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available)

Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. The aggregate value of
investments by input level, as of June 30, 2011, is included at the end of the Fund's Schedule of Investments. Valuation techniques used to value the
Fund's investments by major category are as follows:

Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or
official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities are valued at the last
quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), futures
contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are used and are categorized as Level
2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity
securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market activity and risk are used and are categorized as
Level 3 in the hierarchy.

Semiannual Report

3. Significant Accounting Policies - continued

Security Valuation - continued

Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. For U.S. government and government agency obligations, pricing services utilize matrix pricing which
considers yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices and are generally categorized as
Level 2 in the hierarchy.

When independent prices are unavailable or unreliable, debt securities may be valued utilizing pricing matrices which consider similar factors that
would be used by independent pricing services. These are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy but may be Level 3 depending on the
circumstances.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded and are
categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net
asset value each business day and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.

Investment Transactions and Income. For financial reporting purposes, the Fund's investment holdings and NAV include trades executed
through the end of the last business day of the period. The NAV per share for processing shareholder transactions is calculated as of the close of
business of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time and includes trades executed through the end of the prior
business day. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost and may include proceeds received from litigation.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except for certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
passed, which are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are
recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Distributions received on securities that represent a return of capital or capital gain
are recorded as a reduction of cost of investments and/or as a realized gain. The Fund estimates the components of distributions received that may
be considered return of capital distributions or capital gain distributions. Interest income and distributions from the Fidelity Central Funds are
accrued as earned. Interest income includes coupon interest and amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities.

Expenses. Expenses directly attributable to a fund are charged to that fund. Expenses attributable to more than one fund are allocated among the
respective funds on the basis of relative net assets or other appropriate methods. Expense estimates are accrued in the period to which they relate
and adjustments are made when actual amounts are known.

Deferred Trustee Compensation. Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), independent Trustees may elect to defer receipt of a portion
of their annual compensation. Deferred amounts are invested in a cross-section of Fidelity funds, are marked-to-market and remain in the Fund
until distributed in accordance with the Plan. The investment of deferred amounts and the offsetting payable to the Trustees are included in the
accompanying Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders. Each year, the Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company,
including distributing substantially all of its taxable income and realized gains under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and filing its U.S.
federal tax return. As a result, no provision for income taxes is required. A fund's federal tax return is subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for a period of three years.

Distributions are declared and recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gain distributions are declared separately for each
class. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent book-tax differences. These adjustments have no impact on net assets
or the results of operations. Temporary book-tax differences will reverse in a subsequent period.

Book-tax differences are primarily due to future transactions, market discount, deferred trustees compensation and losses deferred due to wash
sales.

The federal tax cost of investment securities and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) as of period end were as follows:




Gross unrealized appreciation 



$  1,111,717,174





Gross unrealized depreciation 



 (212,467,027)





Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on securities and other investments 



$  899,250,147





Tax cost 



$  1,607,593,429




Under the recently enacted Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Act), the Fund will be permitted to carry forward
capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 22, 2010 for an unlimited period. However, any losses incurred during those
future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to any losses incurred in pre-enactment taxable years, which generally expire after eight
years from when they are incurred. Additionally, post-enactment capital losses that are carried forward will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses rather than being considered all short-term as under previous law. The Fund's first fiscal year end subject to the
Act will be December 31, 2011.

New Accounting Pronouncement. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
and IFRSs. The update changes the wording used to describe the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information
about fair value measurements. The update is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Management is
currently evaluating the impact of the update's adoption on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

4. Derivative Instruments.

Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments. The Fund used derivative instruments (derivatives), including futures contracts, in
order to meet its investment objectives. The strategy is to use derivatives to increase returns and to manage exposure to certain risks as defined
below. The success of any strategy involving derivatives depends on analysis of numerous economic factors, and if the strategies for investment do
not work as intended, the Fund may not achieve its objectives.

The Fund's use of derivatives increased or decreased its exposure to the following risks:




Equity Risk 



Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from
interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all
instruments traded in a market or market segment.




The Fund is also exposed to additional risks from investing in derivatives, such as liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk. Liquidity risk is the
risk that the Fund will be unable to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not be able to fulfill its obligation to the Fund. The Fund's maximum risk of loss from counterparty credit risk is generally the aggregate
unrealized appreciation and unpaid counterparty payments in excess of any collateral pledged by the counterparty to the Fund. Counterparty risk
related to exchange-traded futures contracts is minimal because of the protection provided by the exchange on which they trade. Derivatives
involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the amounts recognized in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Futures Contracts. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specified underlying instrument for a fixed price at a
specified future date. The Fund used futures contracts to manage its exposure to the stock market.

Upon entering into a futures contract, a fund is required to deposit either cash or securities (initial margin) with a clearing broker in an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the face value of the contract. Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily and subsequent payments (variation
margin) are made or received by a fund depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the futures contracts and are recorded as unrealized
appreciation or (depreciation). Realized gain or (loss) is recorded upon the expiration or closing of a futures contract.

The underlying face amount at value of open futures contracts at period end is shown in the Schedule of Investments under the caption "Futures
Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's exposure to the underlying instrument at period end and is representative of activity for the
period. Securities deposited to meet initial margin requirements are identified in the Schedule of Investments. The receivable and/or payable for
the variation margin are reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Certain risks arise upon entering into futures contracts, including the risk that an illiquid market limits the ability to close out a futures contract
prior to settlement date.

During the period the Fund recognized net realized gain (loss) of $1,606,536 and a change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of
($310,763) related to its investment in futures contracts. These amounts are included in the Statement of Operations.

5. Purchases and Sales of Investments.

Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities, aggregated $46,938,420 and $84,914,267, respectively.

6. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates.

Management Fee and Expense Contract. FMR and its affiliates provide the Fund with investment management related services for which the
Fund pays a monthly management fee that is based on an annual rate of .10% of the Fund's average net assets. Under the management contract,
FMR pays all other fund-level expenses, except the compensation of the independent Trustees and certain other expenses such as interest expense, including commitment fees. In addition, under an expense contract, FMR pays class-level expenses so that total expenses do not exceed
..10% of each class' average net assets, excluding the distribution and service fee for each applicable class, with certain exceptions.

Semiannual Report

6. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates - continued

Management Fee and Expense Contract - continued

In July 2011, the Board of Trustees approved an amendment to the management contract lowering the management fee from .10% to .045% of the
Fund's average net assets. Under the expense contract, the total expenses will continue to be limited, with certain exceptions, to .10% of each class'
average net assets, excluding the distribution and service fee for each applicable class. The new management fee rate will be effective September
1, 2011.

Sub-Adviser. Geode Capital Management, LLC (Geode), serves as sub-adviser for the Fund. Geode provides discretionary investment advisory
services to the Fund and is paid by FMR for providing these services.

Distribution and Service Plan Fees. In accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act, the Fund has adopted separate 12b-1 Plans for each Service
Class of shares. Each Service Class pays Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), an affiliate of FMR, a service fee. For the period, the service fee is
based on an annual rate of .10% of Service Class' average net assets and .25% of Service Class 2's average net assets.

For the period, total fees, all of which were re-allowed to insurance companies for the distribution of shares and providing shareholder support
services were as follows:




Service Class 



$  19,416





Service Class 2 



 315,016





 



$  334,432




Transfer Agent Fees. Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. (FIIOC), an affiliate of FMR, is the Fund's transfer, dividend
disbursing, and shareholder servicing agent. FIIOC receives asset-based fees of .067% of each class' average net assets. Under the expense contract,
the classes did not pay transfer agent fees during the period. Effective September 1, 2011, the fee rate will continue to be in effect but, as a result of
the amendment to the management contract referenced above, each class will pay a portion of the transfer agent fees equal to an annual rate of
..055% of the class' average net assets.

7. Committed Line of Credit.

The Fund participates with other funds managed by FMR or an affiliate in a $4.0 billion credit facility (the "line of credit") to be utilized for temporary or emergency purposes to fund shareholder redemptions or for other short-term liquidity purposes. The Fund has agreed to pay commitment
fees on its pro-rata portion of the line of credit, which amounted to $3,819 and is reflected in Miscellaneous expenses on the Statement of Operations. During the period, there were no borrowings on this line of credit.

8. Security Lending. 

The Fund lends portfolio securities from time to time in order to earn additional income. On the settlement date of the loan, the Fund receives
collateral (in the form of U.S. Treasury obligations, letters of credit and/or cash) against the loaned securities and maintains collateral in an
amount not less than 100% of the market value of the loaned securities during the period of the loan. The market value of the loaned securities is
determined at the close of business of the Fund and any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business day. If the
borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities loaned because of insolvency or other reasons, a fund could experience delays and costs
in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the collateral. Any cash collateral received is invested in the Fidelity Securities Lending
Cash Central Fund. The value of loaned securities and cash collateral at period end are disclosed on the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Security lending income represents the income earned on investing cash collateral, less rebates paid to borrowers, plus any premium payments
received for lending certain types of securities. Security lending income is presented in the Statement of Operations as a component of income
from Fidelity Central Funds. Total security lending income during the period amounted to $192,861.

9. Expense Reductions. 

Through arrangements with the Fund's custodian, credits realized as a result of uninvested cash balances were used to reduce the Fund's expenses.
During the period, these credits reduced the Fund's expenses by $16.

12. Other.

The Fund's organizational documents provide former and current trustees and officers with a limited indemnification against liabilities arising in
connection with the performance of their duties to the Fund. In the normal course of business, the Fund may also enter into contracts that provide
general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that
may be made against the Fund. The risk of material loss from such claims is considered remote.

At the end of the period, FMR or its affiliates were the owners of record of 33% of the total outstanding shares of the Fund.
