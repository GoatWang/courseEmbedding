About Career Education Corporation









Career Education’s academic institutions offer a quality education to a 
      diverse student population in a variety of disciplines through online, 
      campus-based and hybrid learning programs. Our two universities – 
      American InterContinental University (“AIU”) and Colorado Technical 
      University (“CTU”) – provide degree programs through the master’s or 
      doctoral level as well as associate and bachelor’s levels. Both 
      universities predominantly serve students online with career-focused 
      degree programs that are designed to meet the educational demands of 
      today’s busy adults. AIU and CTU continue to show innovation in higher

      intellipath™ adaptive learning platform. Career Education is committed 
      to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who 
      seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified 
      workforce.
