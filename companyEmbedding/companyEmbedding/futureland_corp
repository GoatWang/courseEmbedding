FutureLand Corp. (FUTL) Enters Joint Venture Agreement With GreenLeaf Holdings, LLC. To Deliver Solar Technology To The Cannabis Industry






GlobeNewswire



Jul 25, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































 In 2014, a report by the Northwest Power and Conservation Council estimated marijuana operations could grow Washington electricity demand between  60 MW and 160 MW over the next 20 years. Regional demand, including producers in Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington, could reach almost 250 MW by 2035.  In 2015, Utility Dive reported that Pacific Power  experienced 7 localized outages due to demand overloads attributed to marijuana grow operations.  "This is cutting edge technology that is really going to bring down the costs of some major hydroponic grow operations here in the states", said GreenLeaf principal Maury Winnick.  "John Bianchi, of Amps Electric, is a great operator and we are pleased to join forces with him and his company to help create shareholder value in FutureLand Corporation."  About FutureLand Corp. FutureLand Corp., a Colorado company, is a cannabis and hemp specialty zoned land leasing company formed to capitalize upon the emerging global cannabis market. FutureLand, focuses on target acquisition, zoning, license fulfillment, site plan preparation and financing of cannabis or hemp grow facilities throughout the United States.

FutureLand retains ownership of all the land and the structures. FutureLand leases to both medical marijuana, retail marijuana as well as industrial hemp growers.

 FUTURELAND CORP. (OTCMKTS:FUTL) Files An 8-K Other EventsItem 8.01. Other Events.
FutureLand Corp. (FUTL) announces today that it is in the process of applying for Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (MMTC) license in the State of Florida. Under the new regulations, enacted on November 8, 2016, Florida will accept new applications for Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (MMTC) — entities that acquire, cultivate, possess, process (including development of related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments), transfer, transport, sell, distribute, dispense, or administer marijuana, products containing marijuana, related supplies, or educational materials to qualifying patients and caregivers.
The legislation paves way for 10 more medical marijuana treatment centers that will open by Oct. 3, 2017. When 100,000 new eligible patients are added to the patient registry, another license for MMTC will become available to apply for. The state will be opening the application period for Medical Marijuana Treatment Center sometime after July 2017.
The Company has been in discussion with partners around the State and the Country to begin the application process for the Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (MMTC) license in the State of Florida. The Company will partner immediately with its sister companies; HempTech Corp for cultivation expertise and technology – CB Scientific for testing, extraction technology, formulation and delivery devices – and Biotica Pharmaceutical for medical research and discovery. The Company expects to receive one (or more) of the available licenses in the coming month, if not, it will receive one with the expansion of the future licensing.
According to Forbes, Colorado and California may be ground zero for medical marijuana, but Floridacould quickly catch up. A new report from New Frontier Data with market dataprovided by Arcview Market Research projects that Florida's market will grow to $1.6 billion by 2020 at a compound annual growth rate of 140%. That would make it half the size of California's projected$2.6 billion marketand top the projected $1.5 billion medical marijuana market for Colorado.

FutureLand Corp (FUTL) Progressing Toward Its First Recreational Cultivation License in Oregon

							FutureLand Enters the Billion Dollar Oregon Cultivation Market						


Press Release
-

												Aug 30, 2016						
 





			Denver, Colorado, 
			August 30, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	​​​​​​​FutureLand Corp (OTCQB: FUTL), a leading provider of strategic real estate investment, grow facilities, and solutions to the global cannabis industry, provides an update on its progress and direction of the company.
Originally, FutureLand Corp’s primary focus was on pursuing land leasing opportunities in states such as Colorado and Washington.  However, realizing the enormous opening of the medical and recreational cannabis sectors, we decided to expand the scope of business to include medical and recreational cannabis cultivation.  
Looking to the future, it seems natural to include the purchase of dispensaries and infused product licenses where vertical integration is possible. While not all states currently allow publically traded companies to have ownership, FutureLand foresees that opportunity for ownership is on the horizon, and stands ready to take full advantage. 
Initial expansion efforts are already underway, with initial advances just outside the city limits of Grants Pass in Southern Oregon. FutureLand Corp Purchased 50% ownership of 78 acres from HSPendleton, LLC. Together with John Miller of Groovy Groves, plans are underway to file for a recreational license in Josephine County and build out a recreational grow facility with a fully integrated supply chain which consists of a sophisticated onsite cultivation facility and its portfolio of proprietary strains. The estimated forward proforma 12-month GAAP revenue for Grants Pass, Oregon will be over $9 million. 
"Based in Oregon, Grants Pass is strategically positioned to capitalize on the recreational cannabis market in Oregon, which is expected to significantly expand in 2016 and 2017. Today's announcement is a continuation of that vision and I am confident this acquisition will enable FutureLand to achieve rapid growth for the benefit of its stockholders," says CEO Mr. Cox.
“Also, our partners already have another site 10 miles away from Grants Pass where they possess a recreational cultivation license and about 265 acres in Wolf’s Creek, Oregon.  FutureLand holds a first right of refusal on the property and opportunity. The purchase of this property alongside Grants Pass will increase our estimated forward proforma 12-month GAAP revenue from $9 million to $24 million”, concludes Mr. Cox.
Always seeking additional advances, the company has not stopped looking at opportunities in Jamaica, California, other parts of Oregon, Washington, Kentucky (Hemp), Canada, Puerto Rico and more.  Included in this are some targeted acquisitions that could set the stage for an up-list to a higher exchange. 
Additionally, FutureLand is still working closely with HempTech (OTC: HTCO) and Tinkerer’s Obsession Labs to get 1000 grow pods placed around the US and Canada for native tribes to grow cannabis in conjunction with the partnership group.

Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period.

Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.

(FUTL) 2017 Shareholder Update - CEO Defines Direction of the CompanyMarketwiredJanuary 4, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareDENVER, CO--(Marketwired - Jan 4, 2017) - FutureLand Corp. (  OTCQB :  FUTL ), a leading provider of strategic real estate investment, grow facilities and material solutions to the global cannabis industry, announces today a renewed and revitalized vision and direction for the company. CEO, Cameron Cox explains:FutureLand became a public company in mid-2015 after spinning out of FutureWorld Corp. (FWDG), a cannabis incubator. Since that time a few things have become abundantly clear to us. First, we need to be where the plant is. We need to touch the plant, rotate the plant and posit the plant into the marketplace while, at the same time, finding a way to syphon out all the "goodness" it has to offer. Meaning, that how great and to what extent the various parts of the plant can aid with many human ailments on the pharmaceutical side have yet to be determined, but more and more data is pointing to the fact that we are just beginning to scratch the surface. And this work needs to be done.FutureLand began with the idea of land leasing and grew into a need for cultivation and an eye for extracts and dispensing. We believe that a focus on the plant is key to our future success. In addition to these very important components to our business model, we are also looking to add a few items that compliment it in fantastic ways. It is FutureLand's belief that the science of genetics, as it pertains to cannabis and to mapping out the pharmaceutical exchange, which is now underway, will play a very important role for future industry control. The company has this very much in the forefront of its mind as it plans its growth and targets strategic acquisitions.The company has identified specific categories of business that we intend to drill down on and develop in this race. The first leg of our journey is Land. Currently we hold 3 separate parcels: 240 acres in Colorado, 78 acres in Oregon and another 265 acres in Oregon. We believe in real estate and the value of this limited commodity as an investment, and its ability to provide us with access to grow marijuana. The second leg is licensing, particularly licensing to grow marijuana and to dispense the product to the people who need it and want it. FutureLand currently owns a license in Oregon for cultivation and is planning to make application for a second license soon in the same state. The third leg is extracts and all that they entail. Meaning CBD and THC infused edibles and drinks. Naturally, FutureLand will need licensing for the THC. This market has taken off in recent years and we believe that there is plenty of room for FutureLand Corp. The fourth leg is "cannabis supplements" which is not yet a well-defined category in the space, but we intend to flesh this out in the coming months. The fifth leg, and perhaps one of the most important, is biosciences, both genetics and delivery.The company is preparing to build something great. And with the growth of any powerful company, personnel will need to be added. We want to start off by getting some very good people on our advisory board to help us keep our attention on the prize at the end of the race -- to help shepherd the company to facilitate effectively everything it envisions for its future growth. We will begin assembling that team in coming weeks.This is what FutureLand is about. This is what we will be engaged in while building the company. And this is how we are going to build FutureLand into the future landscape of cannabis.About FutureLand Corp.FutureLand Corp., a Colorado company, is a cannabis and hemp specialty zoned land leasing company formed to capitalize upon the emerging global cannabis market.
