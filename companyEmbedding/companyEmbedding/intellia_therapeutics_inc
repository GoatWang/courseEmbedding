Genome Editing Company Overview - Intellia Therapeutics























































Menu














Overview
Intellia is derived from the Greek word, Entelia, meaning a situation of excellence; without any faults. Intellia is a leading genome editing company, focused on the development of proprietary, potentially curative therapeutics using a recently developed biological tool known as the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Intellia believes the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has the potential to transform medicine by permanently editing disease-associated genes in the human body with a single treatment course.

Mission
Developing potentially curative genome editing treatments that can positively transform the lives of people living with severe and life-threatening diseases.
 




Our Approach
Our combination of deep scientific expertise and clinical development experience, along with our leading intellectual property portfolio, puts Intellia in a unique position to unlock broad therapeutic applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and create a new class of therapeutic products.

We believe we are well positioned to maximize the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to develop therapeutics because of:

A strong product focus
Deep management expertise
Strong product-focused partnerships
A risk-mitigated approach to accelerate product development
Delivery expertise
Leading Intellectual Property Position

We are extending this foundational platform, and broadening and optimizing our pipeline, through strategic engagements with partners in industry and academia.



The Future of Medicine

Intellia is not only a leading genome-editing company, but also has the right combination of people, assets and ambitious vision needed to take full advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology’s attributes – high potency, specificity, simplicity of use, broad applicability, and multifunctional programmability – and accelerate the advancement of curative products into the clinic.
The promise of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is the driving force behind the creation of Intellia. Our founders have a shared belief that this technology offers the potential for us to develop curative therapeutic options for patients with chronic diseases by addressing the underlying cause of the disease. It can bring new hope and cures to people who now have nowhere to turn for help.
“The ability to alter host DNA in a precise way has the potential to unlock a substantial amount of unmet medical need heretofore untapped by existing technologies … the value of precisely correcting DNA is immeasurable if accomplished with precision and control.”

Intellia Therapeutics Announces Patent  for CRISPR/Cas Genome Editing in China
Patent covers CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing methods and compositions for use in any setting, including human and other eukaryotic cells



















June 19, 2017 07:30 ET

 | Source: Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.






CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA), a leading genome editing company focused on the development of potentially curative therapeutics using CRISPR technology, today announced that China’s State Intellectual Property Office (“SIPO”) has indicated that it will grant a patent broadly covering CRISPR/Cas9 single-guide gene editing methods and compositions.  The patent includes claims covering methods for editing DNA in non-cellular and cellular settings, including in eukaryotic cells such as human and mammalian cells.  It also includes CRISPR/Cas9 composition of matter and system claims for use in any setting, including claims covering the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in producing medicines for treating disease. “SIPO’s decision further expands our IP portfolio, and is further global recognition that Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and their team are the pioneers in the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in all cell types,” said Intellia Therapeutics Chief Executive Officer and President, Nessan Bermingham, Ph.D. “Intellia continues to build on preclinical work and to focus on the development of our pipeline of novel human therapeutics that will potentially transform the lives of patients with genetic diseases.” The European Patent Office and the United Kingdom’s Intellectual Property Office have previously issued patents from the same underlying international patent application.  This international patent application is based on the same U.S. priority applications that were filed starting in May 25, 2012 by the Regents of the University of California, the University of Vienna and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (collectively, “the UC Intellectual Property”).  Intellia has rights to the UC Intellectual Property, including the European and UK patents, for human therapeutic, prophylactic, and palliative uses (including companion diagnostics), excluding anti-fungal and anti-microbial applications. Intellia obtained these rights through a 2014 license agreement with Caribou Biosciences, Inc., which is the exclusive licensee of the University of California and University of Vienna, two of the co-owners of the intellectual property.  In the United States, certain patent claims from the UC Intellectual Property were involved in an interference proceeding with patents and patent applications owned by the Broad Institute et al. before the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“the PTAB”), and the PTAB decision to terminate the interference is currently on appeal at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. About Intellia TherapeuticsIntellia Therapeutics is a leading genome editing company, focused on the development of proprietary, potentially curative therapeutics using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Intellia believes the CRISPR/Cas9 technology has the potential to transform medicine by permanently editing disease-associated genes in the human body with a single treatment course. Intellia’s combination of deep scientific, technical and clinical development experience, along with its leading intellectual property portfolio, puts it in a unique position to unlock broad therapeutic applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and create a new class of therapeutic products.

Intellia’s Statement on Genome Editing of Human Embryos by U.S. Researchers

July 27, 2017


Intellia is aware of the recent reports of U.S. researchers editing the DNA of human embryonic cells. We cannot speculate on the specifics of the study.
The focus of Intellia’s work is, and will continue to be, on finding treatments that help patients who suffer today. To that end, we are committed to: using genome editing technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9, only for patient benefit; focusing on treating serious diseases of high unmet need; refraining from directly modifying germline cells, including sperm, egg or embryonic tissue, or developing any clinical applications of germline genome editing.
We acknowledge that some applications of genome editing raise important ethical issues, specifically when used for non-therapeutic purposes or for modifying the genomes of germline cells with the intention of affecting future generations.
We take our ethical and social responsibility to not only patients, but also humanity as a whole very seriously, and will continue to develop the technology in an appropriate and ethical way. We are aligned with the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, that cautioned in its February 2017 Report on Human Genome Editing,“heritable germline editing is not ready to be tried in humans,” and “should only be permitted in clinical trials to prevent serious diseases or disabilities if there is stringent oversight in the healthcare system.”

CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics, Caribou Biosciences and ERS Genomics Announce Appellate Brief Seeking Reversal of U.S. Patent Board Decision on CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing

July 25, 2017


• Appeal seeks reversal of Patent Trial and Appeal Board decision terminating interference without determining priority of inventorship of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
• Brief asserts that the Board failed to properly apply controlling U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedents, and ignored evidence of multiple groups readily applying CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to eukaryotic cells following teachings of Charpentier-Doudna team
ZUG, Switzerland; CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts; BERKELEY, California; DUBLIN, Ireland; July 25, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP), Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA), Caribou Biosciences, Inc. and ERS Genomics, Ltd. announced that The Regents of the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (collectively “UC”), co-owners of foundational intellectual property relating to CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, today submitted an appellate brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”) seeking reversal of a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) in an interference proceeding relating to CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. In the appeal, UC requests reversal of the PTAB’s decision terminating the interference between certain CRISPR/Cas9 patent claims owned by UC and claims of the Broad Institute, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (collectively, “Broad”).
In its brief to the Federal Circuit (Case No. 17-1907), UC asserts that the PTAB’s February 15, 2017 determination that the UC patent claims did not make the Broad’s patent claims obvious is based on a misapplication of controlling legal standards established by U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent. In its decision, the PTAB had concluded that UC’s claims covering CRISPR/Cas9 single guide gene editing technology and its application in any cellular or non-cellular setting did not make obvious Broad’s claims covering application of the same technology limited to use in eukaryotic cellular settings.
In its brief, UC sets forth multiple errors in the PTAB’s holding that the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in eukaryotes is separately patentable as alleged by Broad, including the following:
• With respect to the obviousness of applying the technology to eukaryotic cells, U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedents clearly mandate that obviousness determinations be based on an “expansive and flexible approach” including consideration of “the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ.” In contrast, the PTAB applied a narrow and restrictive approach that ignored certain key evidence, including the steps actually employed by those of skill in the art at the time, and also effectively required a “guarantee” that UC’s CRISPR/Cas9 invention would work in eukaryotic cells, when well-established case law requires only a “reasonable expectation of success.”
• With respect to the reasonable expectation of success standard that establishes obviousness, the PTAB effectively ignored U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Circuit case law, which emphasize that an invention can be obvious if it is “obvious to try,” even if success is not guaranteed, “[w]hen there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem,” “there are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions,” and experimentation leads to “the anticipated success.”
• The PTAB ignored U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent highlighting that the occurrence of what appear to be simultaneous “inventions” arising close together in time is itself strong evidence of their obviousness, and accordingly requiring that such evidence be considered in any obviousness analysis. In contrast, in terminating the interference, the PTAB essentially dismissed as “irrelevant” the evidence that six different laboratories successfully applied UC’s claimed CRISPR/Cas9 invention in eukaryotic cells using conventional techniques within months after UC publicly disclosed the invention – some of them prior to Broad’s first filing.
• The PTAB effectively ignored that Broad’s own eukaryotic application of UC’s CRISPR/Cas9 invention had simply utilized conventional prior art techniques. As a consequence, it failed to consider that Broad’s alleged invention did not reflect any significant innovation on Broad’s part, an important issue under applicable precedent.
• The PTAB failed to hold Broad to its burden of proving, among other things, the effective priority date for its patent claims, as required by the PTAB’s own rules and Federal Circuit precedent. By not requiring the Broad to meet its burden of proof, and by merely assuming that all of the Broad’s claims were entitled to their earliest possible filing date despite Broad’s failure of proof, the PTAB improperly ignored relevant intervening art that made the Broad’s claims obvious.
As explained in UC’s brief, application of the correct legal standards to the case is believed to require reversal of the PTAB’s decision. For these reasons, UC requests that the Federal Circuit instruct the PTAB to reinstate the interference proceeding so that it can properly determine priority of inventorship, as previously requested by UC. The PTAB’s failures to consider pertinent evidence and apply appropriate legal standards should at the very least require the matter to be remanded so that the PTAB can properly consider the evidence related to obviousness and Broad’s no-interference-in-fact motion using appropriate legal standards.
In the PTAB’s February decision terminating the interference proceeding prematurely, it had not yet considered the teachings of UC’s own prior-filed patent application with respect to using CRISPR/Cas9 in eukaryotic cells. Instead, the PTAB only addressed the threshold question of whether use in eukaryotic cells can be separately patentable from use in all settings as covered by UC’s claims. However, determinations on the underlying substantive matters have recently been made in parallel prosecution before the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (“USPTO”). The USPTO has rejected a series of patent applications filed by Broad that are directed to uses of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells as being non-novel in view of UC’s prior-filed patent application, which the USPTO examiners considered to have effectively taught use of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells. In addition, patent applications filed by Sigma-Aldrich and Toolgen that similarly claim use of CRISPR/Cas9 in eukaryotic cells (both of which filed applications before Broad’s application) have likewise recently been rejected as being either non-novel or obvious in view of the prior-filed UC patent application with specific respect to its teachings regarding application of the invention to use in eukaryotic cells.
Consistent with the substantive determinations reached by the USPTO regarding the broad teachings of the UC patent application, UC’s corresponding cases covering use of CRISPR/Cas9 in all settings, including in eukaryotic cells, have been advanced to grant or decisions to grant in numerous jurisdictions worldwide, including in the United Kingdom, the nearly 40 other countries that are members of the European Patent Convention, and more recently in other jurisdictions such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and China.

Intellia Therapeutics Announces Patent for CRISPR/Cas Genome Editing in China

June 19, 2017


– Patent covers CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing methods and compositions for use in any setting, including human and other eukaryotic cells 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NTLA), a leading genome editing company focused on the development of potentially curative therapeutics using CRISPR technology, today announced that China’s State Intellectual Property Office (“SIPO”) has indicated that it will grant a patent broadly covering CRISPR/Cas9 single-guide gene editing methods and compositions.  The patent includes claims covering methods for editing DNA in non-cellular and cellular settings, including in eukaryotic cells such as human and mammalian cells.  It also includes CRISPR/Cas9 composition of matter and system claims for use in any setting, including claims covering the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in producing medicines for treating disease.
“SIPO’s decision further expands our IP portfolio, and is further global recognition that Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and their team are the pioneers in the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in all cell types,” said Intellia Therapeutics Chief Executive Officer and President, Nessan Bermingham, Ph.D. “Intellia continues to build on preclinical work and to focus on the development of our pipeline of novel human therapeutics that will potentially transform the lives of patients with genetic diseases.”
The European Patent Office and the United Kingdom’s Intellectual Property Office have previously issued patents from the same underlying international patent application.  This international patent application is based on the same U.S. priority applications that were filed starting in May 25, 2012 by the Regents of the University of California, the University of Vienna and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (collectively, “the UC Intellectual Property”).  Intellia has rights to the UC Intellectual Property, including the European and UK patents, for human therapeutic, prophylactic, and palliative uses (including companion diagnostics), excluding anti-fungal and anti-microbial applications. Intellia obtained these rights through a 2014 license agreement with Caribou Biosciences, Inc., which is the exclusive licensee of the University of California and University of Vienna, two of the co-owners of the intellectual property.  In the United States, certain patent claims from the UC Intellectual Property were involved in an interference proceeding with patents and patent applications owned by the Broad Institute et al. before the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“the PTAB”), and the PTAB decision to terminate the interference is currently on appeal at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Intellia’s Response to Nature Methods Article on CRISPR/Cas9

June 8, 2017


Recently Schaefer et al. (1) reported the presence of more than a thousand genome differences between mice that had been edited with S. pyogenes Cas9 at the zygote stage, and a control mouse of the same strain. Given the overlap of genetic differences between the two edited mice compared to the control mouse, the authors concluded that these differences arose from a Cas9-dependent activity. Flaws in the study design and data analysis, however, make this conclusion inappropriate. Based on the information available on the mouse study, the more plausible conclusion is that the genetic differences reflect a normal level of variation between individuals in a colony.
These alternative interpretations can be resolved by establishing when the reported differences arose in the lineage of these mice. The authors assume, given the pattern of homo- and heterozygosity, that they occurred in a burst in either the 1- or 2-cell stage even though the intended Cas9 repair occurred at a later stage given the mosaicism of these edited animals (2). Unfortunately, the authors did not sequence the parents, nor do we know if the edited animals (F03 and F05) are true sibs or simply closely related. There is also no information given on how closely related the colony control animal was to the parents used in this study. This missing evidence is critical to support their conclusion. Notably, in an unrelated study, WGS of unedited inbred mouse littermates showed 985 sites of variation between individuals (3), a number similar to that found in the authors’ dataset (696 SNVs and indels). Furthermore, a second unrelated study directly examined the effects of Cas9 editing (with intact Cas9 cleavase or Cas9D10A nickase) using WGS (4). These authors saw significant variation between individuals, but after comparison with relevant control parental and sib genomes, demonstrated the opposite result, namely that Cas9 induced no unexpected mutations. Absent the parental DNA sequence, the Schaefer authors could also have either looked at more than 2 F0 animals, or examined the degree of overlap between the control genome and either edited mouse, which they did not do (they only reported on variant sites in the edited mice absent from the control genome). This complete pairwise analysis could directly support or refute their claim.
Beyond this missing evidence, the authors’ explanation requires activities that Cas9 is not known to possess. First, the authors show that none of the edited sites has sufficient target homology to the guide (5) to support Watson-Crick gRNA-DNA base pairing. There was no genome-wide unbiased off-target analysis done with the chosen guide RNA (2), so we have no baseline for understanding its specificity. Second, 13/30 sites presented (43%) lack a -GG- PAM within 4 bases of the variant, the only known pre-requisite for Cas9 to engage with DNA (6). Third, there is no known mechanistic basis for Cas9 to induce SNVs, nor did the authors propose one. Indeed the preponderance of SNVs reported is consistent with their being caused by spontaneous deamination, a major driver of sequence drift in genomes (7).
In summary, we feel that the principal conclusions of the paper (that the variation seen was unexpected and that it was Cas9-mediated) have not been demonstrated, and a simpler alternative explanation was not explored.

Intellia Therapeutics Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results

May 2, 2017



First to demonstrate single dose, in vivo results using a proprietary lipid nanoparticle delivery system showing: approximately 97 percent reduction in serum transthyretin protein levels; 70 percent liver editing efficiency following a single dose; six months post-single-dose durability of stable liver editing
Appeal of U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board decision on CRISPR/Cas9 interference involving Intellia-licensed patent family filed by the University of California and other co-owners
European Patent Office announced decision to grant CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology patent and the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office granted national chimeric CRISPR/Cas9 patent 
First quarter 2017 cash position of $258 million

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 2, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTLA), a leading genome editing company focused on the development of potentially curative therapeutics using CRISPR technology, announced financial results for the first quarter 2017.
“The first quarter of 2017 has been highly productive for Intellia as we continue to advance our preclinical programs toward developing life-transforming therapies. Building on our earlier results showing 97 percent in vivo reduction of serum transthyretin protein levels, our durability data also continue to demonstrate stable liver editing and support our vision that genome editing could be effective with just a single dose,” said Nessan Bermingham, Ph.D., chief executive officer, and founder, Intellia Therapeutics. “We expect to advance  preclinical studies significantly this year by progressing our technology in non-human primate studies and look toward its potential broad clinical applications to help treat patients with unmet medical needs.”
Business Highlights
During the first quarter of 2017, the company achieved numerous important milestones:
Significantly advanced the genome editing field with unprecedented liver editing and lipid nanoparticle delivery data using CRISPR/Cas9 as a potential one-time treatment.  

In March, the company reported editing efficiency in vivo with a significant reduction of serum transthyretin (TTR) protein levels. More recent durability study data show stable liver editing in mice for at least six months following a single administration.

Enhanced in vivo gene editing in the TTR locus, with an efficiency of approximately 70 percent in the total mouse liver at the target DNA site, after a single intravenous administration;
Decreased serum TTR protein levels of up to approximately 97 percent; and
Achieved undetectable Cas9 messenger RNA (mRNA) and guide RNA (gRNA) in the liver by 72 hours, post administration.



Defended and enhanced our CRISPR/Cas9 foundational and therapeutic intellectual property position.

The European Patent Office (EPO) decided to grant to co-owners the Regents of the University of California, University of Vienna, and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (collectively, UC) a patent broadly covering the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. The patent includes claims covering compositions of the widely adopted CRISPR single guide RNA technology for use in any non-cellular or cellular setting, including eukaryotic cells such as human or mammalian cells, as well as for use in human therapeutics. This European patent, which is expected to grant on May 10, 2017, will be nationalized in, and cover, approximately forty European countries that are member states of the European Patent Organisation.
In addition to the EPO decision, earlier this year, the United Kingdom’s (U.K.) Intellectual Property Office granted to UC a second national patent on the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. This February 7, 2017 U.K. patent covers chimeric CRISPR/Cas9 systems in which the Cas9 protein is modified to provide alternative DNA-modulating activities while the first U.K. patent obtained by UC covers the single guide RNA for uses in both non-cellular and cellular settings.
In April 2017, UC appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit the decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to terminate the interference between certain CRISPR/Cas9 patent claims owned by UC and patents and patent applications owned by the Broad Institute, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. UC is seeking review and reversal of the PTAB’s February 15, 2017 decision, which concluded that, although the claims overlap, the respective scope of UC and Broad’s claim sets do not define the same patentable invention and, accordingly, terminated the interference without deciding which party first invented the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells.

First Quarter 2017 Financial Results
Collaboration Revenue
Collaboration revenue was $6.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.8 million for the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in collaboration revenue in 2017 was primarily driven by amounts recognized under our collaboration agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Regeneron), which was entered into in April 2016.
Through March 31, 2017, the company received $103.1 million in funding under its collaborations with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (Novartis) and Regeneron, excluding amounts received for equity investments, and recorded accounts receivable of $2.4 million. Excluding the $2.6 million of the upfront payment received from Novartis which was allocated to the purchase of equity securities, we recognized $28.8 million in collaboration revenue under these agreements through March 31, 2017 and had remaining deferred revenue of $74 million as of March 31, 2017.
Operating Expenses
Research and development expenses increased $8.2 million to $13.4 million during the first quarter 2017, compared to $5.2 million during the same period of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by increased salary and related headcount-based expenses, including equity-based compensation expenses, as the company grew to 88 research and development employees as of March 31, 2017, from 44 research and development employees as of March 31, 2016. This increase supported the advancement of our early-stage research programs including, consumption of laboratory supplies and research materials.
General and administrative expenses increased $2.5 million to $5.7 million during the first quarter of this year, compared to $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by increased salary and related headcount-based expenses, including equity-based compensation expenses, as the company grew to 31 general and administrative employees as of March 31, 2017, from 17 general and administrative employees as of March 31, 2016. The company also incurred increased corporate insurance, legal, and other professional expenses related to its expanding operations since becoming a public company in May 2016.
Our net loss was $12.6 million for the first quarter 2017, compared to $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2016.
Balance Sheet
Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017, were $258 million, compared to $64 million for the same quarter in 2016. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to $115.5 million in proceeds from our initial public offering, $55 million in concurrent private placements and a $75 million upfront payment from Regeneron in April 2016, partially offset by cash used in operations.
Financial Guidance
Our primary uses of capital will continue to be research and development services, compensation and related expenses, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses, patent prosecution, filing and maintenance costs for our licensed intellectual property, and general overhead costs.
During 2017, the company expects expenses to continue to increase compared to prior periods in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as research and development and preclinical activities gather momentum, and we spend a full year occupying our new office and laboratory facility, which we began to occupy in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As of March 31, 2017, the company had an accumulated deficit of $66.2 million. We expect our losses to increase as we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Based on our research and development plans and expectations related to the progress of the company’s programs, we expect that cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017, as well as technology access and research funding from Novartis and Regeneron, will enable Intellia to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures through mid-2019, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments or extension fees received under our collaboration agreements with Novartis and Regeneron.
Upcoming Events During the Second Quarter 2017
The company expects to make presentations at the following upcoming scientific and investor conferences:

The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, May 13, Washington
The TechConnect World Innovation Conference, May 16, Washington
Jefferies Healthcare Conference, June 6, New York City
JMP Securities Life Sciences Conference, June 20, New York City
Goldman Sachs Third Annual Innovation Symposium, June 27, New York City

Intellia Therapeutics and CRISPR Therapeutics Announce U.S. Patent Covering CRISPR/Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein Complexes

April 26, 2017


CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Basel, Switzerland, April 26, 2017, (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) and CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), two leading genome editing companies focused on the development of potentially curative therapies, announced that the United States Patent and Trademarks Office (“USPTO”) is expected to issue a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing patent to Vilnius University (“Vilnius”). Intellia and CRISPR are nonexclusive sublicensees for a defined field of human therapeutic, prophylactic, and palliative uses (including companion diagnostics), excluding anti-fungal and anti-microbial applications.
The Vilnius patent claims are directed to CRISPR/Cas9 complexes assembled in vitro and used for site-specific modification of target DNA sequences. CRISPR/Cas9 complexes, referred to as CRISPR ribonucleoproteins or “RNPs,” are contemplated for use in a number of ex vivo applications in which cells, such as blood cells, may be corrected or edited outside of the body before being returned to a patient as a potential therapeutic. The patent is expected to issue on May 2, 2017 as U.S. Patent No. 9,637,739.
This new patent, together with the companies’ respective rights to foundational CRISPR/Cas9 intellectual property co-owned by The Regents of the University of California, University of Vienna and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier, provide CRISPR and Intellia with complementary rights to inventions claimed by the earliest developers in the discovery and application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
Intellia has a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide sublicense to the Vilnius intellectual property through a 2014 license agreement with Caribou Biosciences, Inc., under which Intellia has an exclusive, worldwide sublicense to certain of Caribou’s developed or in-licensed CRISPR/Cas9 technology intellectual property for a defined field of human therapeutic, prophylactic, and palliative uses (including companion diagnostics), excluding anti-fungal and anti-microbial applications. Caribou has certain rights to Vilnius University’s intellectual property through a cross-license agreement with the DuPont Company.
CRISPR acquired rights to this patent as a result of a cross-option and license agreement with Intellia which was completed in connection with the global agreement on foundational intellectual property for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing that both companies jointly announced with the co-owners and licensors, as well as another licensee, on December 16, 2016. Under the cross-option and license agreement, CRISPR has a royalty-free worldwide sublicense to Intellia’s rights to the Vilnius intellectual property.

CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics, Caribou Biosciences and ERS Genomics Announce Appeal of CRISPR/Cas9 U.S. Patent Board Decision

April 13, 2017



Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit seeks review and reversal of the Patent Trial and Appeals Board’s decision to terminate CRISPR/Cas9 interference
In parallel, the companies and their licensors plan to pursue additional patents in the U.S. and worldwide covering the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and its use in cellular and non-cellular settings, including eukaryotic cells

BASEL, Switzerland; CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts; BERKELEY, California; DUBLIN, Ireland; April 13, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP), Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NTLA), Caribou Biosciences and ERS Genomics announced today that The Regents of the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (collectively “UC”), co-owners of foundational intellectual property relating to CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”) the decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) to terminate the interference between certain CRISPR/Cas9 patent claims owned by UC and patents and patent applications owned by the Broad Institute, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (collectively, “Broad”).
In the appeal, UC is seeking review and reversal of the PTAB’s February 15, 2017 decision, which terminated the interference without determining which inventors actually invented the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology in eukaryotic cells. In its decision, the PTAB concluded that, although the claims overlap, the respective scope of UC and Broad’s claim sets as presented did not define the same patentable invention and, accordingly, terminated the interference without deciding which party first invented the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells. UC is asking the Federal Circuit to review and reverse the PTAB’s decision.
In parallel with the appeal, UC is pursuing applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions worldwide to obtain patents claiming the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and its use in non-cellular and cellular settings, including eukaryotic cells. Corresponding patents have already been granted in the United Kingdom, and the European Patent Office is also granting a patent to UC, which will issue on May 10, 2017. UC’s earliest patent application describing the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and its use was filed on May 25, 2012, while the Broad’s earliest patent application was filed more than six months later, on December 12, 2012.
The law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP will be handling the appeal, with Don Verrilli, former Solicitor General of the United States, as lead counsel.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
