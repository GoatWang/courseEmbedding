And Muslims' fears that Israel wants it for their own religious and national purposes are, unfortunately, well grounded.

Tel Aviv wants to wrest control of it back for Israel, because in Jewish religious traditions, the building of the 3rd Temple will herald the beginning of the Messianic age.

Israeli Prime Minister knew that the optics of the metal detectors and forbidding anyone under 50 to worship at Al Aqsa would be horrific; but in his characteristic hubris, he just didn't give a damn.

Through these actions, he may well have lit the flames for yet another intifada; then, he will use this violence as "the justification" to tighten down the screws against Palestinians even more than they are already.

I weep for all those dead and wounded, Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, and those who will die, and be wounded, on all sides; this is an absolute tragedy which could have been averted.

A violent response to these strictures for worshiping at Al Aqsa was precisely the outcome Netanyahu, and the Israeli government wanted to happen.Join the Conversation1 / 5447

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

SpendSmart Payment Company Changes Name to SpendSmart Networks
Coincides With Expanded Product Offering



















June 19, 2014 07:04 ET

 | Source: SpendSmart Networks, Inc.





SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif., June 19, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - SpendSmart Payments Company Inc., a publicly traded company (SSPC) announces it will operate worldwide under the name SpendSmart Networks, Inc., effective Friday June 20th, 2014.

	SpendSmart Networks, Inc., a company known for enabling parents and young people to link and communicate in order to guide responsible spending through their award winning Teen Prepaid Card, is expanding its suite of offerings to encompass digital customer loyalty and reward programs for both merchants and consumers, thanks to the recent acquisition of SMS Masterminds.

	"This change from SpendSmart Payments Company to SpendSmart Networks comes at a defining moment in our company's future, kicking off our new initiatives and goals; to become the world leader in digital customer loyalty," said Alex Minicucci, CEO of SpendSmart. "We are in the digital relationship business - we want to connect consumers and merchants in a variety of ways, while rewarding both for their participation in our global loyalty network."

	SMS Masterminds, part of the SpendSmart Networks suite of service offerings, has gained the loyalty of almost two million consumers via mobile rewards programs at their favorite local merchants. These loyalty programs are setup and administered by 'Certified Loyalty Masterminds' who are experts in customer engagement, and retain an exclusive license to represent the loyalty network in their markets. This network recently expanded to Mexico and Canada.

	"The ongoing strength of the brand has opened doors in new and emerging markets, as SpendSmart Networks now represents a company with a clearer global brand and cohesive global marketing approach," said Bill Hernandez, President of SpendSmart Networks. The change of our company name to SpendSmart Networks Inc. enables us to support a much broader mission, it grants us access into additional business verticals that are a logical extension of the combined entity resulting from the acquisition of SMS Masterminds."

	Minicucci has hinted that this is just the beginning of more great things coming down the pipeline, and that this name change is merely a sneak peek at the direction in which SpendSmart is headed.
