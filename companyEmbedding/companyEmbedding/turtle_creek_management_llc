Our Services
We offer a customized approach to investment management and utilize a range of individual equity and fixed income investments




Investment Management Services
We are an investment manager primarily for private clients typically with at least $2 million of investable assets. We offer a customized approach to investment management and utilize a range of individual equity and fixed income investments. We provide our services to clients on a discretionary basis using separately managed accounts. Each client at Turtle Creek works with an individual portfolio manager. Portfolio managers focus on developing investment strategies and portfolios that are consistent with a client’s investment objectives. We focus on serving individuals, families, and institutional clients.







Trust and Estate Services
Our investment management business is complemented by Turtle Creek Trust Company, LTA which offers an array of fiduciary and trust administration services. We administer all types of personal trusts, and our services include:

Trust and Estate Administration
Monthly Account/Reporting
1099’s, IRS tax reporting
Fiduciary income tax return (coordinated with outside CPA’s)
Quarterly Estimated Tax payments
                         
















Our Approach
We construct investment portfolios tailored to each client’s specific investment objectives and risk tolerance.






Investment Philosophy
Turtle Creek Management emphasizes a highly personalized approach to investment management, actively constructing portfolios of high-quality equities and bonds based on each client’s unique risk tolerance and goals.
Our professionals are balanced investment managers, deploying a time-tested and disciplined approach to fixed income and equity security selection.
We believe superior investment outcomes are achieved by maintaining a long-term investment horizon, minimizing portfolio turnover, controlling potential investment risk, and avoiding undue tax obligations.
Our view of risk is the potential for permanent impairment of client’s assets through an investment. While risk is inherent in the investment process, we seek to minimize it by building properly diversified portfolios and investing in corporations exhibiting significant competitive advantages, financial strength, an established history of growth, and above-average returns on invested capital. 
 


Client Communication
We seek to keep clients informed in a timely and concise manner.   Clients of Turtle Creek can expect to receive communication including:

Letters detailing actions taken in portfolios
Monthly Statements from our independent custodians, State Street Bank and Trust and Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services.
Annual tax planning letter and 1099 package from the custodian
Web-based access to account information and historical data.
Periodic updates on key events within the firm

At Turtle Creek, our personnel are all very accessible via phone and  email.  We strive to ensure that open lines of communication are  maintained with the client which provides a level of transparency not  experienced at some of the larger, less personalized institutions.






Equity Investment Process
Turtle Creek utilizes an intrinsic value style of stock selection. We believe discrete measures of corporate performance such as earnings growth, profitability, and leverage are individual components, not the primary determinants, of a business’s overall intrinsic value.
We research and value each company based on a rigorous and consistent methodology emphasizing longer-term growth and expected free cash flow generation. We seek to buy competitively advantaged companies with secular growth prospects, strong financial profiles, and attractive returns on invested capital.
We manage investment risk and estimate potential return by investing in securities at significant discount to our estimate of a firm’s longer-term value, junctures at which a company’s market valuation reflects potentially negative future scenarios at odds with more likely longer term outcomes.
We are unconstrained equity managers, exploring investment opportunities across market capitalizations and in both high-growth and mature companies. 
 
Fixed Income Investment Process
Turtle Creek Management assembles diversified portfolios of high quality corporate, treasury, agency, and municipal bonds with the primary goals of portfolio risk reduction and income generation.
We utilize a fundamental credit analysis process, analyzing the credit quality and duration risk of individual bonds and focusing on attractive relative valuations to the broader universe of fixed income securities.
We maintain an intermediate duration for each portfolio, ten years or less, to dampen the impact of potential interest rate movements on a portfolio’s value.
To ensure best pricing and execution and enhance portfolio yield, we avoid the traditional inventory approach to bond sourcing. We instead maintain a pro-active auction approach, consistently sourcing multiple bids and offers for any single issue across a large group of broker counterparties.
