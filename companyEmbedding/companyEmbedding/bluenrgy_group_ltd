What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
