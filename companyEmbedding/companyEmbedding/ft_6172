        looking to replace an old model.
What model replaces the JVM1740DM1WW. I need to replace it after 7 years.

        Very satisfied!
I purchased this after my last GE microwave died.  I had the last one for over 15 years and did not even look at another brand.  Very satisfied with this product.

        Just right for my family's needs
When our 22-year-old 850-watt 1-cu ft Whirlpool microwave conked out, I agonized about having to buy one of these new modern disposable-quality appliances that seem to have a max life of 5 years.  I pored over many brands, models, and reviews.  I only need something basic to reheat food and cook an occasional frozen meal.  This GE microwave checked off our requirements.  The vent works although of course not as good as a dedicated vent hood.  The surface light is bright enough.  The control panel is readable but it would have been better if the letters & numbers are a tad bigger.  The contrast between black & white is good enough.  Like any other shiny black appliance, smudges and dust easily show on it.  Sound volume:  microwave running - medium (you don't have to shout if you're talking to somebody but it's definitely not a soft purr), vent - medium.  So far, so good ... for how long?  I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Installation:  It took the 2 Home Depot installers 30 minutes from unpacking to finish.  That included removing the old microwave.

        simple easy to use controls
This unit replaced an LG that died after only 3 years. So far we are very satisfied with this unit.

Smart River GIS for improved decision makingProduct Type: Science FeatureYear: 2008Author(s): Hanson, L., S.C. Williamson, T.J. Waddle, C. Talbert, and J.E. HeasleySuggested Citation: Hanson, L., S.C. Williamson, T.J. Waddle, C. Talbert, and J.E. Heasley. 2008. Smart River GIS for improved decision making. 08/28/2008With an increasing human population and a finite supply of water, management of rivers and their associated ecosystems is becoming an ever-more complicated issue for decision-makers across the Nation. Our understanding of river systems has improved because of developments in both technology and scientific understanding of ecosystems. Models have been used to predict flow and manage river systems for decades. As our knowledge of ecosystem processes and ability to collect more precise data increase, we find that we are data rich. However, multiple riverine georeferenced data layers generally do not align to allow comparable results and outputs. Often, differences in the spatio-temporal dimension of existing data cause significant obstacles. The next important step in better managing our natural resources is to effectively combine datasets and multiple model inputs and outputs for an enhanced understanding of these complex systems...

Riverside Neighborhoods are a joy to live in!

                    Riverside is a very diverse city that offers many different types of lifestyles. These neighborhoods are what allows us to meet the unique living environments of its residents. You know what is great? I can drive down one set of neighborhoods to find brand new homes or find homes from the 1920¿s just a block or two away.

If you are looking to move to Riverside, as a new resident, or long-time resident, contact me to learn all about Riverside neighborhoods and the great things they can offer. It is the largest,smallest community you will ever live in.

                    I've lived in Riverside for 18 years and as vast as it is it always amazes me how it's really like a small town. You will always meet someone and inevitably have similar friends or contacts in common. I love this about this area...not to mention the various neighborhoods that have their own characteristics. For instance, the Wood Streets is a lovely area of Riverside know for it's charming older homes and quaint streets. Drive through this area during Christmas or Halloween and you are sure to have a lot of fun viewing all the decorated homes. There's also the ever changing and growing downtown area. This area is transforming and becoming a great place if you like being in the hub of the action. Riverside...a big city with a small town feel.

                    Downtown Riverside is the Heart of the City with many cultural and historic locations, not to mention the University of Riverside.  Homes range from Spanish Colonial Revival, Mission Revival, California Bungalows to modern new built homes.  The Mission Inn is probably the most famous location in Riverside and during the holidays is decorated with millions of lights.  It's a great event when the lights are turned on and a wonderful place to start your holiday festivities.  Orchards, parks and shopping abound.  You'll never lack for something to do.
