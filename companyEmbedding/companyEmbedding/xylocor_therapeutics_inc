FDA Grants Fast Track Designation to XyloCor Therapeutics Lead 
      Candidate XC001






May 08, 2017 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWTOWN SQUARE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--XyloCor Therapeutics Inc., a privately held biotech company, today 
      announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
      granted Fast Track designation to its lead product candidate XC001 
      (AdVEGF-All6A+), a cardiovascular angiogenic gene therapy. XC001 is a 
      one-time treatment being investigated for improving exercise tolerance 
      in patients who have chronic angina that is refractory to standard 
      medical therapy and not amenable to conventional revascularization 
      procedures such as coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous 
      coronary intervention and stents.
    


      “Achieving Fast Track status validates the need for XC001, which has the 
      potential to be a unique treatment for this serious condition with high 
      unmet need - chronic, refractory angina,” said Al Gianchetti, President 
      and Chief Executive Officer of XyloCor. “This designation is supported 
      by strong scientific evidence for XC001 and clinical validation of this 
      mechanism of action in refractory angina. This important designation is 
      intended to contribute to an expedited development and regulatory review 
      process, which can get the drug sooner to patients who can benefit from 
      it.”
    

      The FDA Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development 
      and expedite the review of new drugs and vaccines intended to treat or 
      prevent serious conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address 
      an unmet medical need.
    

      XC001 is a novel gene therapy that promotes angiogenesis, the formation 
      of new vessels that can provide arterial blood flow to myocardial 
      regions with inadequate blood supply. Enhancing myocardial blood flow 
      with therapeutic angiogenesis is intended to relieve myocardial 
      ischemia, improve regional and global left ventricular performance, 
      alleviate angina symptoms and disability and potentially improve 
      prognosis.
    

      “There are many patients in the United States with refractory angina and 
      there are no available treatment options,” said Magnus Ohman, Professor 
      of Medicine, The Kent and Siri Rawson Director, Duke Program for 
      Advanced Coronary Disease, Duke University School of Medicine. “These 
      patients have significant limitations in terms of their daily activities 
      because of the chest pain associated with their ischemic disease and 
      XC001 could be an important new option for them.”
    

      An IND for XC001 is open with the FDA and XyloCor intends to commence 
      clinical trials upon funding.

FDA Grants Fast Track designation to XyloCor Therapeutics Lead Candidate XC001 
Newtown Square, PA, May 8, 2017 —  XyloCor Therapeutics Inc., a privately held biotech company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to its lead product candidate XC001 (AdVEGF-All6A+), a cardiovascular angiogenic gene therapy. XC001 is a one-time treatment being investigated for improving exercise tolerance in patients who have chronic angina that is refractory to standard medical therapy and not amenable to conventional revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention and stents. 
 
“Achieving Fast Track status validates the need for XC001, which has the potential to be a unique treatment for this serious condition with high unmet need – chronic, refractory angina,” said Al Gianchetti, President and Chief Executive Officer of XyloCor. “This designation is supported by strong scientific evidence for XC001 and clinical validation of this mechanism of action in refractory angina. This important designation is intended to contribute to an expedited development and regulatory review process, which can get the drug sooner to patients who can benefit from it.”
 
The FDA Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and vaccines intended to treat or prevent serious conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need.
 
XC001 is a novel gene therapy that promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new vessels that can provide arterial blood flow to myocardial regions with inadequate blood supply. Enhancing myocardial blood flow with therapeutic angiogenesis is intended to relieve myocardial ischemia, improve regional and global left ventricular performance, alleviate angina symptoms and disability and potentially improve prognosis.  
 
“There are many patients in the United States with refractory angina and there are no available treatment options,” said Magnus Ohman, Professor of Medicine, The Kent and Siri Rawson Director, Duke Program for Advanced Coronary Disease, Duke University School of Medicine. “These patients have significant limitations in terms of their daily activities because of the chest pain associated with their ischemic disease and XC001 could be an important new option for them.”
 
An IND for XC001 is open with the FDA and XyloCor intends to commence clinical trials upon funding.
