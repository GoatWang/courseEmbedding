Correction: This story originally misidentified the highway that leads to Shangri-La. The story has been corrected.AFTON — Eddy Gibbs simply wanted to fix the golf course at his lake home.Shangri-La was slowly falling apart, a sad end to what was once Oklahoma’s premier resort.So Gibbs bought the property, on the southern tip of Monkey Island on Grand Lake, and began an unlikely six-year journey to rebuild and re-imagine what was possible.“Honestly, all I wanted to do was fix and reopen the golf course,” Gibbs said. “I wasn’t going into this with a grand plan.”What followed has been nothing short of miraculous.Shangri-La’s resort hotel is scheduled to open in April and will complete a stunning makeover of Oklahoma’s best-known resort. Some reports estimate the makeover has cost well over $35 million.Will it be as fabulous as the original?“Absolutely,” Gibbs said.Shangri-La opened in 1964 and was billed as Oklahoma’s premier resort. It struggled financially in the 1960s but started to take hold during renovations and improvements, including a 36-hole golf course, in the 1970s.However, it started to decline from facilities neglect in the early 2000s.That’s where Gibbs, in 2010, stepped in with an enthusiastic rescue.The 36-hole Shangri-La Golf Club has been remade into 27 holes with a 13,000-square-foot clubhouse on the highest point of Monkey Island.The Shangri-La Resort is a four-story, 120-room hotel with a large pool and outdoor area modeled after a resort in the Turks and Caicos Islands. An adjoining marina/restaurant/bar has been completely renovated with about 240 boat slips.More development is coming. Gibbs plans to build at least 90 more homes and has been researching the possibility of adding a nine-hole, par-3 course in a forested canyon near the existing golf layout.It was far more than Gibbs, who founded and grew Ameristar Fence Products into one of Oklahoma’s largest and most successful home-grown companies, had planned.“About 15 years ago, I was deciding what I wanted to do,” Gibbs said. “I thought about several options but then decided to buy a lake house up here on Monkey Island. Then, I bought another one.“I loved to play golf at Shangri-La.”One problem: Shangri-La was no longer the deluxe facility that once played host to celebrity golf tournaments and the National Governor’s Conference.In fact, golf memberships had dwindled to about 70. The lodge was in disrepair and closing.“I had been in manufacturing,” Gibbs said. “So I didn’t get into this to rebuild a resort.”
But he did want to do something about the golf course when it closed. So, he bought it.“I looked at the project as more of a hobby. I knew how to cut grass,” he said. “But once we got into it, things really mushroomed. It grew into so much more.”The first project was clearing the original lodge off the southern point of Monkey Island.“We looked into it, but it really couldn’t be saved,” Gibbs said. “So we bulldozed it.“Here we are six years later and we’re rebuilding a new, beautiful lodge on the original spot. We’ve built condos and homes. And, we’ve done the golf course.”If the golf course is any indication, Monkey Island and Grand Lakers were ready for a Shangri-La transformation. Membership at the golf club has jumped to about 440.Home prices on Monkey Island have started to rise again, up about 30 percent in five years. The number of full-time residents on Monkey Island has inched up to about 24 percent from 18 percent.Restaurants and other businesses are starting to pop up all along Oklahoma 125, the main road that cuts through the heart of the 6-mile-long Monkey Island and dead ends at Shangri-La.Of course, the Oklahoma resort business in 2016 is far different than it was in the 1960s and 1970s when Shangri-La started to flourish.These days there are deluxe resort hotels tied to casinos throughout the state. Many believe the two best are the Hard Rock in Catoosa and the Margaritaville Resort in south Tulsa, which have a combined 991 rooms and are within 90 minutes of Monkey Island. When the Osage tribe completes a $150 million project at the Osage Casino in 18 months, there will be 1,117 resort rooms directly tied to casino gaming in the Tulsa metropolitan area.“It is two different businesses,” Gibbs said. “Those resorts are tied to the gambling.“This is a family-style, lake resort. I believe it is two different markets. We’re really excited about this project.”

I would place the restraint at Shangri-La at either first or second only to the Hard rock's Magill's 19. Both are 6 star if their if there was such a rating.

Pardon me if I fail to get excited over this golf course built for an exclusive, and might I add, exclusionary, crowd of people who will not welcome the rabble of the common folks.  Like so many other courses such as the one found across the lake at the Coves for example, this beautiful spot will be reserved for a select few.  The only interruption  you may experience as you make your way round the course will be the occasional deer, grazing on exotic grasses designed to withstand the harsh Oklahoma weather.  So, Eddy, enjoy your golf game at Shangri-La.  Just don't expect the masses out there to enjoy it with you.

You might want to do some quick research before posting negative nonsense like this. This is a public course.  The Coves is a private course. You can play Shangri-La on a weekday for $59 during the Fall/Winter and $75 during the Spring. Weekday rack rate at LaFortune and almost every other public course in Tulsa is $40+ and Forest Ridge is $60.
