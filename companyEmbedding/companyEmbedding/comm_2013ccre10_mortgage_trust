How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Loan Type:

Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 27, 2017 - Lock
Today's Outlook
Judging from early market trends, it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today. However, those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a sharper rise, a holding steady, or even a fall all remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, including:

This morning's domestic economic data – Durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected, though the former figure was inflated by one-time orders for aircraft. Meanwhile, the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing.


The U.S. Treasury will be auctioning 7-year notes at 1:00 pm (ET).
Skittishness ahead of tomorrow's announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for 2017's second quarter.
Events on Capitol Hill as the U.S. Senate continues to debate health care reform. To some, the credibility of President Trump's wider business and tax agenda is at stake.

If we were currently buying a home, we would lock our rate now, at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks. Read on to discover why you might prefer to float.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages inched down yesterday, giving some relief after Tuesday's sharp rise. They remain close to where they were between July 12-18. Rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to lock now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive June's and early July's rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

 Potential for Mortgage Rates to Move Significantly Today, But Which Way?
 Mortgage Rates Look Set to Fall Again Today
 Mortgage Rates Look Likely to Fall or Hold Steady Today


What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

Exhibit 99.3
 

 
MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT
 
This Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (this “Agreement”), is dated and effective August 13, 2013 between KeyBank National Association, as seller (the “Seller”), and Deutsche Mortgage & Asset Receiving Corporation, as purchaser (the “Purchaser”).
 
The Seller desires to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, the commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing mortgage loans (collectively, the “Mortgage Loans”) identified on the schedule annexed hereto as Exhibit A (the “Mortgage Loan Schedule”).
 
It is expected that the Mortgage Loans will be transferred, together with other commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing mortgage loans (such Mortgage Loans, the “Other Mortgage Loans”) to COMM 2013-CCRE10 Mortgage Trust, a trust fund (the “Trust Fund”) to be formed by the Purchaser, the beneficial ownership of which will be evidenced by a series of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates (the “Certificates”).  The offer and sale of certain classes of the Certificates (the “Registered Certificates”) will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).  The Trust Fund will be created and the Certificates will be issued pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement to be dated as of August 1, 2013 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), among the Purchaser, as depositor (in such capacity, the “Depositor”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer (in such capacity, the “Master Servicer”), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (in such capacity, the “Special Servicer”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator, custodian and paying agent (in its capacity as certificate administrator, the “Certificate Administrator”), Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the “Operating Advisor”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).
 
The Purchaser intends to sell the Registered Certificates to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“DBS”), Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“CF&Co.”), UBS Securities LLC (“UBS”), KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (“KeyBanc”), CastleOak Securities, L.P. (“CastleOak”) and Nomura Securities International, Inc. (“Nomura” and, together with DBS, CF&Co., UBS, KeyBanc and CastleOak, in such capacity, the “Underwriters”) pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated as of August 1, 2013 (the “Underwriting Agreement”).  The Purchaser intends to sell other Certificates (the “Non-Registered Certificates”) to DBS, CF&Co., UBS, KeyBanc and Nomura (together, in such capacity, the “Initial Purchasers”) pursuant to a certificate purchase agreement dated as of August 1, 2013 (the “Certificate Purchase Agreement”).  Capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (in effect as of the Closing Date) or in the Indemnification Agreement, dated August 1, 2013 (the “Indemnification Agreement”), among the Seller, the Purchaser, the Underwriters and the Initial Purchasers.
 


  


  





  


 
Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
 
SECTION 1.     Agreement to Purchase.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser upon receipt of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in this Section 1, and the Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Mortgage Loans.  The purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on or about August 13, 2013 or such other date as shall be mutually acceptable to the parties hereto (the “Closing Date”).  As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loans will have an aggregate principal balance (the “Aggregate Cut-off Date Balance”), after application of all payments of principal due thereon on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received, of $138,957,677, subject to a variance of plus or minus 5.0%.  The purchase price of the Mortgage Loans (inclusive of accrued interest and exclusive of the Seller’s share of the costs set forth in Section 9 hereof) (the “Mortgage Loan Purchase Price”) shall be equal to the amount set forth on the cross receipt between the Seller and the Purchaser dated the date hereof.
 
SECTION 2.     Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.
 
(a)           On the Closing Date, subject only to receipt by the Seller of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price, the satisfaction of the other closing conditions required to be satisfied on the part of Purchaser pursuant to Section 7 and the issuance of the Certificates, the Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, without recourse, all the right, title and interest of the Seller from and after the Closing Date in and to the following property whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising (the “Covered Assets”): the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, including all rights to payment in respect thereof, which, notwithstanding the foregoing, includes all interest and principal received or receivable by the Seller on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date (subject to the proviso in the next sentence), together with all of the Seller’s right, title and interest in and to the proceeds of any related title, hazard, or other insurance policies and any escrow, reserve or other comparable accounts related to the Mortgage Loans, subject to (i) that certain Agreement to Appointment of Master Servicer dated as of August 1, 2013, among the Master Servicer, the Depositor and the Seller and (ii) the rights of any related Companion Loan Noteholder pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, if any.  The Purchaser shall be entitled to (and, to the extent received by or on behalf of the Seller, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser) all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date, and all other recoveries of principal and interest collected thereon after the Cut-off Date; provided, however, that all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-off Date and collected after the Cut-off Date shall belong to the Seller, and the Purchaser or its successors or assigns shall promptly remit any such payments to the Seller.
 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan that is subject to an Intercreditor Agreement, the parties hereto intend that the provisions of this Section 2(a) serve as an assignment and assumption agreement between the Seller, as the assignor, and the Purchaser, on behalf of the Trust, as the assignee.  Accordingly, the Seller hereby (and in accordance with and subject to all   
 


  


-2-





  


 
other applicable provisions of this Agreement) assigns, grants, sells, transfers, delivers, sets over, and conveys to the Purchaser all right, title and interest of the Seller in, to and arising out of the related Intercreditor Agreement and the Purchaser, on behalf of the Trust, hereby accepts (subject to applicable provisions of this Agreement) the foregoing assignment and assumes all of the rights and obligations of Seller with respect to related Intercreditor Agreement from and after the Closing Date.  In addition, the Purchaser acknowledges that any such Mortgage Loan that is a Serviced Mortgage Loan shall be serviced pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall, or shall at the expense of the Seller cause a third party vendor (which may be the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Custodian pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or otherwise) to, (1) complete (to the extent necessary) and submit for recording (in favor of the Trustee in the following form: “U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of COMM 2013-CCRE10 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates” (in such capacity and, with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of any related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders)) in the appropriate public recording office (a) each Assignment of Mortgage referred to in clause (iii) of Exhibit B which has not yet been submitted for recording and (b) each Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits referred to in clause (viii)(B) of Exhibit B (if not otherwise included in the related Assignment of Mortgage) which has not yet been submitted for recordation; and (2) complete (to the extent necessary) and file in the appropriate public filing office each UCC assignment of financing statement referred to in clause (v)(B) and (xiii) of Exhibit B which has not yet been submitted for filing or recording.  In the event that any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, the Seller shall promptly prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute therefor or cure or cause the curing of such defect, as the case may be, and shall thereafter deliver the substitute or corrected document to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including, without limitation, the Trustee) for recording or filing, as appropriate, at the Seller’s expense.  In the event that the Seller receives the original recorded or filed copy, the Seller shall, or shall cause a third party vendor or any other party under its control to, promptly upon receipt of the original recorded or filed copy (and in no event later than 5 Business Days following such receipt) deliver such original to the Custodian, with evidence of filing or recording thereon.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2, in those instances where the public recording office retains the original Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, if applicable, after any has been recorded, the obligations hereunder of the Seller shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon delivery to the Custodian of a copy of the recorded original of such Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits.
 
On the Closing Date, upon (i) notification from the Seller that the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in Section 1 has been received by the Seller and (ii) the issuance of the Certificates, the Purchaser shall be authorized to release to the Certificate Administrator or its designee all of the Mortgage Files in the Purchaser’s possession relating to the Mortgage Loans.

(b)           In connection with the Seller’s assignment pursuant to subsection (a) above, and subject to subsections (c) and (d) below, the Seller shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, the Custodian, on or before the Closing Date, the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix) of Exhibit B for each Mortgage Loan so assigned (with originals with respect to clause (i) and copies with respect to clauses (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix)) and, except as otherwise provided in Section 2(d) below, within 30 days following the Closing Date, the remaining applicable documents in Exhibit B for each such Mortgage Loan, with copies to the Master Servicer.
 
(c)           If the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original Note, the Seller shall deliver a copy or duplicate original of such Note, together with an affidavit certifying that the original thereof has been lost or destroyed and an indemnification in connection therewith in favor of the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Custodian.
 
(d)           If the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of any of the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (ii), (v)(A), (viii)(A), (xiv) and (xvi) of Exhibit B and the UCC financing statements and UCC assignments of financing statements referred to in clause (xiii) of Exhibit B, with evidence of recording or filing thereon, solely because of a delay caused by the public recording or filing office where such document or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, or because such original recorded or filed document has been lost or returned from the recording or filing office and subsequently lost, as the case may be, the delivery requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that a copy of such document or instrument (without evidence of recording or filing thereon, but certified (which certificate may relate to multiple documents and/or instruments) by the applicable public recording or filing office, the applicable title insurance company or by the Seller to be a true and complete copy of the original thereof submitted for recording or filing, as the case may be) has been delivered to the Custodian within 45 days after the Closing Date, and either the original of such missing document or instrument, or a copy thereof, with evidence of recording or filing, as the case may be, thereon, is delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee) within 180 days after the Closing Date (or within such longer period after the Closing Date as the Custodian may consent to, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed so long as the Seller has provided the Custodian with evidence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, or has certified to the Custodian as to the occurrence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, and is, as certified to the Custodian no less often than quarterly, in good faith attempting to obtain from the appropriate public recording or filing office such original or copy, provided such extensions do not exceed 24 months in the aggregate).
 
If the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of the related lender’s title insurance policy referred to in clause (vii) of Exhibit B solely because such policy has not yet been issued, the delivery requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that the Seller has delivered to the Custodian a binder marked as binding and countersigned by the title insurer or   
 


  


-4-





  


 
its authorized agent (which may be a pro forma or specimen title insurance policy which has been accepted or approved in writing as binding by the related title insurance company) or an acknowledged closing instruction or escrow letter, and the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee), promptly following the receipt thereof, the original related lender’s title insurance policy (or a copy thereof).
 
In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if there exists with respect to any group of related cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans only one original of any document referred to in Exhibit B covering all of the Mortgage Loans in such group, then the inclusion of the original of such document in the Mortgage File for any Mortgage Loan in such group shall be deemed an inclusion of such original in the Mortgage File for each such Mortgage Loan.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to the documents referred to in clause (xix) and clause (xx) on Exhibit B, the Seller acknowledges that the Master Servicer will hold the original of each such document in trust on behalf of the Trustee in order to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust and the Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied the delivery requirements of this Agreement by delivering the original of each such document to the Master Servicer.  The Seller shall pay any costs of assignment or amendment of such letter of credit required (which assignment or amendment shall change the beneficiary of the letter of credit to the Trust in care of the Master Servicer) in order for the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust.  In the event that the documents specified in clause (xx) on Exhibit B are missing because the related assignment or amendment documents have not been completed, the Seller shall take all reasonably necessary steps to enable the Master Servicer to draw on the related letter of credit on behalf of the Trust including, if necessary, drawing on the letter of credit in its own name pursuant to written instructions from the Master Servicer and immediately remitting such funds (or causing such funds to be remitted) to the Master Servicer.
 
Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement by the Purchaser and the Seller, the Seller shall deliver a power of attorney substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto to each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, that permits such parties to take such other action as is necessary to effect the delivery, assignment and/or recordation of any documents and/or instruments relating to any Mortgage Loan which have not been delivered, assigned or recorded at the time required for enforcement by the Trust Fund.  The Seller will be required to effect at its expense the assignment and, if applicable, recordation of its Loan Documents until the assignment and recordation of all such Loan Documents has been completed.
 
(e)           Except as provided below, all documents and records in the Seller’s possession (or under its control) relating to the Mortgage Loans that are not required to be a part of a Mortgage File in accordance with Exhibit B but that are reasonably required to service the Mortgage Loans and copies of the documents in the Mortgage File (all such other documents and records, including Environmental Reports, as to any Mortgage Loan, the “Servicing File”), together with all escrow payments, reserve funds and other comparable funds in the possession of the Seller (or under its control) with respect to the Mortgage Loans, shall (unless they are held    
 


  


-5-





  


 
by a sub-servicer that shall, as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer pursuant to a written agreement between such parties) be delivered by the Seller (or its agent) to the Master Servicer (as the Purchaser’s designee) no later than the Closing Date; provided, however, the Seller shall not be required to deliver, and the Servicing File shall not be deemed to include drafts of Loan Documents, attorney-client or internal communications of the Seller or its affiliates or Seller’s credit underwriting or due diligence analyses or related data (as distinguished from Environmental Reports, financial statements, credit reports, title reports, structural and engineering reports, appraisals and other reports, analyses or data provided by the Borrowers or third parties other than the Seller’s attorneys).  If a sub-servicer shall, as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan pursuant to a written agreement between such parties, the Seller or its agent shall deliver a copy of the related Servicing File to the Master Servicer.
 
(f)            Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will treat, and their respective records will reflect, the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser as a sale, including for tax and accounting purposes.  Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, the Seller will not take any action inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser or its assignees.
 
(g)           Furthermore, it is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser as provided in this Agreement be, and be construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser and not a pledge of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of Seller.  However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be property of Seller or if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans:
 
(i)     this Agreement shall hereby create a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the applicable state;
 
(ii)    the conveyance provided for in this Agreement shall hereby grant from Seller to Purchaser, and Seller hereby grants to Purchaser, a security interest in and to all of Seller’s right, title, and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to the Covered Assets and all proceeds thereof;

(ii)           The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, and the performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement by the Seller, do not violate the Seller’s organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or other instrument to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or any of its assets, in each case which materially and adversely affects the ability of the Seller to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.     Repurchases; Substitutions.
 
(a)           If the Purchaser discovers that any document constituting a part of a Mortgage File has not been delivered within the time periods provided for herein, has not been properly executed, is missing, does not appear to be regular on its face or contains information that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (each, a “Defect”), or discovers or receives notice of a breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller made pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan (a “Breach”), and if such Defect is a Material Defect or such Breach is a Material Breach, then the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Seller.  If any such Defect or Breach materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests in such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser, or causes the related Mortgage Loan to be other than a “qualified mortgage” (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) which causes a defective mortgage loan to be treated as a “qualified mortgage”), then such Defect shall constitute a “Material Defect” or such Breach shall constitute a “Material Breach,” as the case may be; provided, however, that if any of the documents specified in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix) of the definition of “Mortgage File” is (subject to Sections 2(c) and 2(d) hereof) not delivered, and is certified as missing pursuant to Section 2.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, it shall be deemed a Material Defect.  Promptly upon receiving written notice of any Material Defect or Material Breach with respect to a Mortgage Loan, accompanied by a written demand to take the actions contemplated by this sentence, the Seller shall not later than 90 days from the Seller’s receipt from the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) of notice of, and demand to take action with respect to, such Material Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be (or, in the case of a Material Defect or Material Breach relating to a Mortgage Loan not being a “qualified mortgage” as described in the preceding sentence, not later than 90 days after the Seller or any party to the Pooling and Servicing      
 


  


-11-





  


 
Agreement discovers such Material Defect or Material Breach) (any such 90-day period, the “Initial Resolution Period”), (i) cure the same in all material respects, (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable Repurchase Price or (iii) substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan (provided that in no event shall such substitution occur later than the second anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account any Substitution Shortfall Amount in connection therewith; provided that if (i) such Material Defect or Material Breach (other than one relating to a deemed Material Defect under the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence) is capable of being cured but not within the Initial Resolution Period, (ii) such Material Defect or Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage Loan’s not being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions and (iii) the Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Defect or Material Breach within the Initial Resolution Period, then the Seller shall have an additional period equal to the applicable Resolution Extension Period to complete such cure or, failing such cure, to repurchase the Mortgage Loan or substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by a Mortgaged Property that is, in whole or in part, a hotel, restaurant (operated by a Borrower), healthcare facility, nursing home, assisted living facility, self-storage facility, theatre or fitness center (operated by a Borrower), then the failure to deliver to the Custodian copies of the UCC financing statements with respect to such Mortgage Loan shall not be a Material Defect.
 
If the Seller is notified of a Defect in any Mortgage File that also affects information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Seller shall promptly correct such Defect and provide a new, corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Purchaser, which corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule shall be deemed to amend and replace the existing Mortgage Loan Schedule for all purposes.  The failure of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to notify the Seller of a Material Defect or Material Breach shall not constitute a waiver of any cure or repurchase obligation, provided that the Seller must receive written notice thereof as described in this Section 6(a) before commencement of the Initial Resolution Period.
 
If (x) there exists a Breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the Seller as set forth in, or made pursuant to, representation 30 or 32 of Exhibit D to this Agreement relating to fees and expenses payable by the Borrower associated with the exercise of a defeasance option, a waiver of a “due-on-sale” provision or a “due-on-encumbrance” provision or the release of any Mortgaged Property, and (y) the related Loan Documents specifically prohibit the Master Servicer or Special Servicer from requiring the related Borrower to pay such fees and expenses, then, upon notice by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, the Seller may cure such breach by transferring to the Collection Account, within 90 days of the Seller’s receipt of such notice, the amount of any such fees and expenses borne by the Trust Fund that are the basis of such Breach. Upon its making such deposit, the Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Breach in all respects.  Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees regarding any such Breach, regardless of whether it constitutes a Material Breach, and the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or otherwise cure such Breach.
 


  


-12-





  


 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(a), in lieu of the Seller performing its obligations with respect to any Material Breach or Material Defect provided in the three preceding paragraphs, to the extent that the Seller and the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund, and, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Controlling Class Representative) are able to agree upon a cash payment payable by the Seller to the Purchaser (or its assignee) that would be deemed sufficient to compensate the Purchaser (or its assignee) for a Material Breach or Material Defect (a “Loss of Value Payment”), the Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay such Loss of Value Payment to the Purchaser (or its assignee); provided that a Material Defect or a Material Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a “qualified mortgage”, within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3), may not be cured by a Loss of Value Payment.  Upon its making such payment, the Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Material Breach or Material Defect in all respects.  Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees regarding any such Material Breach or Material Defect, and the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or replace the related Mortgage Loan or otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material Defect.
 
(b)           In connection with any repurchase of, or substitution for, a Mortgage Loan contemplated by this Section 6:
 
(i)            the Custodian, the Master Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage Loan other than a Specially Serviced Loan) and the Special Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage Loan that is a Specially Serviced Loan), pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall each be required to tender to the Seller, and the Seller shall be entitled to receive therefrom, all portions of the Mortgage File (in the case of the Custodian) and the Servicing File (in the case of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable) and other documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, upon delivery:
 
(A)           to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a trust receipt, and
 
(B)            to the Custodian by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a Request for Release and an acknowledgement by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, of its receipt of the Repurchase Price or the Substitution Shortfall Amount from the Seller;
 
(ii)           each document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File that was endorsed or assigned to the Trustee shall be endorsed or assigned without recourse in the form of endorsement or assignment provided to the Custodian by the Seller, as the case may be, to the Seller as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller the legal and beneficial ownership of each Removed Mortgage Loan to the extent such ownership was transferred to the Trustee; and
 
(iii)          the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall release, or cause the release of, any escrow payments and reserve   
 


  


-13-





  


 
funds held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan(s) to the Seller.
 
(c)           This Section 6 provides the sole remedies with respect to the Mortgage Loans available to the Purchaser, and its successors and permitted assigns (i.e., the Trustee and the holders of the Certificates) in respect of any Defect in a Mortgage File or any Breach.  If the Seller defaults on its obligations to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Section 6, or disputes its obligation to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 6, the Purchaser may take such action as is appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including, without limitation, the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings.  To the extent the Purchaser prevails in such proceeding, the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of such obligation of the Seller to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Section 6.  To the extent the Seller prevails in such proceeding, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such proceeding.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a Material Breach or Material Defect with respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant to the terms of any partial release provisions in the related Loan Documents (and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact, released), (ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the requirements, if any, set forth in the Loan Documents and the Seller provides an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur and (iii) each Rating Agency then rating the Certificates shall have provided a No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to such release.
 
(d)           As to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, at the direction of the Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) or the Special Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties), the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan (with a copy to the Master Servicer), the related Mortgage File with the related Note endorsed as required by Exhibit B hereto.  Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans in or prior to the month of substitution shall not be part of the Trust Fund and, if received by the Master Servicer, shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to the Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date.  For the month of repurchase or substitution, distributions to Certificateholders pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will include the Monthly Payment(s) due on the related Removed Mortgage Loan and received by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust on or prior to the related date of repurchase or substitution, as applicable, and the Seller shall be entitled to retain all amounts received thereafter in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan.
 
In any month in which the Seller substitutes one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Removed Mortgage Loans, pursuant to this Agreement, the Master Servicer will determine the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount.  At the direction of the Certificate Administrator, the Seller shall deposit, or deliver to the Master Servicer for     
 


  


-14-





  


 
deposit, into the Collection Account cash equal to such amount concurrently with the delivery of the Mortgage Files for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, without any reimbursement thereof.  Any Mortgage Loan that is repurchased or replaced by the Seller pursuant to this Section 6 shall constitute a “Removed Mortgage Loan”.
 
(e)           If the Seller (i) receives from any Person (other than the Depositor) any Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request; (ii) rejects any Repurchase Request or is in dispute with the Person making any Repurchase Request as to the merits of such Repurchase Request (a “Dispute”); or (iii) receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request Withdrawal, then the Seller shall deliver notice thereof (each, a “Rule 15Ga-1 Notice”) to the Depositor within ten (10) Business Days of the Seller’s receipt thereof (or in the case of a rejection or Dispute, the occurrence and commencement thereof).  Each Rule 15Ga-1 Notice shall include (i) the identity of the related Mortgage Loan, (ii) the date the Repurchase Communication of the Repurchase Request or the Repurchase Request Withdrawal was received, as applicable, and (iii) in the case of a Repurchase Request, the identity of the Person making such Repurchase Request and, if known, the basis for the Repurchase Request (as asserted in the Repurchase Request).
 
“Repurchase Communication” means, for purposes of this Section 6(e) only, any communication, whether oral or written, which need not be in any specific form.
 
(f)            The Seller shall provide to the Depositor relevant portions of any Form ABS-15G that the Seller is required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (only to the extent that such portions relate to any Mortgage Loan) on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days before the date such Form ABS-15G is required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In connection with such filing, upon the request of the Seller, the Depositor shall provide to the Seller the Trust Fund’s Central Index Key (CIK) number and such other information regarding the principal balances of the Mortgage Loans as is reasonably necessary for the Seller to complete and file such Form ABS-15G.
 
(g)           The Seller agrees that a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider will not, in connection with providing the Seller with any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice (for purposes of this Section 6(g) only, as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), be required to provide any information protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrines.  In addition, the Seller hereby acknowledges that (i) any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is so provided only to assist the Seller, the Depositor and its Affiliates to comply with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, Items 1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and any other requirement of law or regulation and (ii) (A) no action taken by, or inaction of, a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider and (B) no information provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the exercise of any legal right the Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider may have with respect to this Agreement, including with respect to any Repurchase Request that is the subject of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice.
 
(h)           Each party hereto agrees that the receipt of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice or the delivery of any notice required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 6 shall not, in and of   
 


  


-15-





  


 
itself, constitute delivery of notice of, receipt of notice of, or knowledge of the Seller of, any Material Defect or Material Breach.

The closing of the purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans (the “Closing”) shall be held at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, One World Financial Center, New York, New York 10281 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date.

MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER
REGARDING THE INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE LOANS
 




(1)


Whole Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans.  Each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage Loan.  At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to Purchaser, no Note or Mortgage was subject to any assignment (other than assignments to the Seller), participation or pledge, and the Seller had good title to, and was the sole owner of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations, any other ownership interests on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement.  Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and the assignment to Purchaser constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan.



 




(2)


Loan Document Status. Each related Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including, without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the mortgagee’s realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Standard Qualifications”).



 
Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentences, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Borrower with respect to any of the related Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any such valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by Seller in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Note, Mortgage or other Loan Documents.
 


  


D-1





  


 




(3)


Mortgage Provisions.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, non-judicial foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications.



 




(4)


Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications.  Since origination and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File or as otherwise provided in the related Mortgage Loan documents (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and related Loan Documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect; (b) no related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither the related Borrower nor the related guarantor has been released from its material obligations under the Mortgage Loan.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, except as contained in a written document included in the Mortgage File, there have been no modifications, amendments or waivers, that could be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on such Mortgage Loan consented to by Mortgage Loan Seller on or after July 23, 2013.



 




(5)


Lien; Valid Assignment.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits to the Trust constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment to the Trust.  Each related Mortgage and Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits is freely assignable without the consent of the related Borrower.  Each related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related Borrower’s fee or leasehold interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below) and the exceptions to paragraph (6) set forth on in Schedule D-1 to this Exhibit D (each such exception, a “Title Exception”)), except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions) as of origination was, and as of the Cut-off Date, to the Seller’s knowledge, is free and clear of any recorded mechanics’ liens, recorded materialmen’s liens and other recorded encumbrances which are prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below), and, to the Seller’s knowledge and subject to the rights of tenants (as tenants only) (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions), no rights exist which under law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below).  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) financing statements is required in order to effect such perfection.



 


  


D-2





  


 




(6)


Permitted Liens; Title Insurance.  Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked up” commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the “Title Policy”) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to (a) the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet due and payable; (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record; (c) the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; and (f) if the related Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan (each a “Crossed Mortgage Loan”), the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with such Crossed Mortgage Loan, provided that none of which items (a) through (f), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the Borrower’s ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively, the “Permitted Encumbrances”).  Except as contemplated by clause (f) of the preceding sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of the related Mortgage.  Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Seller thereunder and no claims have been paid thereunder. Neither the Seller, nor to the Seller’s knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy.



 




(7)


Junior Liens.  It being understood that B notes secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Crossed Mortgage Loan, there are, as of origination, and to the Seller’s knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date, no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics and materialmen’s liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraph (5) above), and equipment and other personal property financing).  The Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the related Borrower.



 




(8)


Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits.  There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits creates a valid



 


  


D-3





  


 
first-priority collateral assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to a license granted to the related Borrower to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications.  The related Mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, subject to applicable law, provides that, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the mortgagee.
 




(9)


UCC Filings.  If the related Mortgaged Property is operated as a hospitality property, the Seller has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned by such Borrower and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may be.  Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the items of personalty described above.  No representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements are required in order to effect such perfection.



 




(10)


Condition of Property.  Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property within six months of origination of the Mortgage Loan and within twelve months of the Cut-off Date.



 
An engineering report or property condition assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than twelve months prior to the Cut-off Date.  To the Seller’s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material damage (other than (i) any damage or deficiency that is estimated to cost less than $50,000 to repair, (ii) any deferred maintenance for which escrows were established at origination and (iii) any damage fully covered by insurance) that would affect materially and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.
 




(11)


Taxes and Assessments.  All taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges), or installments thereof, that could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would be 



 


  


D-4





  


 
of equal or superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon.  For purposes of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent until the earlier of (a) the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement action is entitled to be taken by the related taxing authority.
 




(12)


Condemnation.  As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the Seller’s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.



 




(13)


Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan.  As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving any Borrower, guarantor, or Borrower’s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a) such Borrower’s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such Borrower’s ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor’s ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage Loan documents or (f) the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property.



 




(14)


Escrow Deposits.  All escrow deposits and payments required to be escrowed with lender pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with lender under the related Loan Documents are being conveyed by the Seller to Purchaser or its servicer.



 




(15)


No Holdbacks.  The Stated Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date of the Mortgage Loan set forth on the mortgage loan schedules attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Borrower or other considerations determined by Seller to merit such holdback).



 




(16)


Insurance.  Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a “special cause of loss form” or “all risk form” that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of



 


  


D-5





  


 
the related Loan Documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of any one of the following:  (i) at least “A-:VIII” from A.M. Best Company, (ii) at least “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or (iii) at least “A-” from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service (collectively the “Insurance Rating Requirements”), in an amount (subject to a customary deductible) not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2) the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the Borrower and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.
 
Each related Mortgaged Property is also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).
 
If any material part of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards, the related Borrower is required to maintain insurance in the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.
 
If the Mortgaged Property is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, the related Borrower is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or “named storms” issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or named storms.
 
The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by the Seller for loans originated for securitization, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate.
 
An architectural or engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing either the scenario expected limit (“SEL”) or the probable maximum loss (“PML”) for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL or PML, as applicable, was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL or PML, as applicable, would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by an  
 


  


D-6





  


 
insurer rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or “A-”  by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service in an amount not less than 100% of the SEL or PML, as applicable.
 
The Loan Documents require insurance proceeds in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a) to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then outstanding principal amount of the related Mortgage Loan, the lender (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses, or (b) to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan together with any accrued interest thereon.
 
All premiums on all insurance policies referred to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the lender under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the Trustee.  Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Borrower to maintain all such insurance and, at such Borrower’s failure to do so, authorizes the lender to maintain such insurance at the Borrower’s cost and expense and to charge such Borrower for related premiums.  All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at least 10 days’ prior notice to the lender of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment of a premium and at least 30 days prior notice to the lender of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by Seller.
 




(17)


Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots.  Each Mortgaged Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access via an irrevocable easement or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created.



 




(18)


No Encroachments.  To Seller’s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the lender’s Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked up” commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except 



 


  


D-7





  


 
encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy.  No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the removal of which would not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements obtained with respect to the Title Policy.
 




(19)


No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation.  No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature or an equity participation by Seller.



 




(20)


REMIC.  The Mortgage Loan is a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3) (but determined without regard to the rule in the U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain defective mortgage loans as qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A) the issue price of the Mortgage Loan to the related Borrower at origination did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either: (a) such Mortgage Loan is secured by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property) having a fair market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan on such date, provided that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b) substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve or protect the real property which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party credit enhancement within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations).  If the Mortgage Loan was “significantly modified” prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code, it either (x) was modified as a result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause (B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause (B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto.  Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan constitute “customary prepayment penalties” within the meaning of Section 1.860G-1(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.  All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related Treasury Regulations.

Compliance with Usury Laws.  The Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury.

(22)


Authorized to do Business.  To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held the Note, each holder of the Note was authorized to transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property is located, or the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan by the Trust.



 




(23)


Trustee under Deed of Trust.  With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Seller’s knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related mortgagee.



 




(24)


Local Law Compliance.  To the Seller’s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architect’s letter, a zoning consultant’s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loans intended for securitization, with respect to the improvements located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan and as of the Cut-off Date, there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively “Zoning Regulations”) other than those which (i) constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure, as to which as the Mortgaged Property may be restored or repaired to the full extent necessary to maintain the use of the structure immediately prior to a casualty or the inability to restore or repair to the full extent necessary to maintain the use or structure immediately prior to the casualty would not materially and adversely affect the use or operation of the Mortgaged Property, (ii) are insured by the Title Policy or other insurance policy, (iii) are insured by law and ordinance insurance coverage in amounts customarily required by the Seller for loans originated for securitization that provides coverage for additional costs to rebuild and/or repair the property to current Zoning Regulations or (iv) would not have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan.  The terms of the Loan Documents require the Borrower to comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning and building laws.



 




(25)


Licenses and Permits.  Each Borrower covenants in the Loan Documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations necessary for its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the Seller’s knowledge based upon a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations are in effect.  The Mortgage Loan requires the related Borrower to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located.



 


  


D-9





  


 




(26)


Recourse Obligations.  The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan is non-recourse to the related parties thereto except that (a) the related Borrower and at least one individual or entity shall be fully liable for actual losses, liabilities, costs and damages arising from certain acts of the related Borrower and/or its principals specified in the related Loan Documents, which acts generally include the following: (i) acts of fraud or intentional material misrepresentation, (ii) misapplication or misappropriation of rents, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, (iii)  intentional material physical waste of the Mortgaged Property, and (iv) any breach of the environmental covenants contained in the related Loan Documents, and (b) the Mortgage Loan shall become full recourse to the related Borrower and at least one individual or entity, if the related Borrower files a voluntary petition under federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law.



 




(27)


Mortgage Releases.  The terms of the related Mortgage or related Loan Documents do not provide for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment, or partial Defeasance (as defined in paragraph (32)), of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) upon a Defeasance (as defined in paragraph (32)), (d) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e) as required pursuant to an order of condemnation.  With respect to any partial release under the preceding clauses (a) or (d), either: (x) such release of collateral (i) would not constitute a “significant modification” of the subject Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations and (ii) would not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail to be a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3)(A); or (y) the mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance with the related Loan Documents, condition such release of collateral on the related Borrower’s delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately preceding clause (x).  For purposes of the preceding clause (x), if the fair market value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan outstanding after the release, the Borrower is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions.



 
In the case of any Mortgage Loan, in the event of a taking of any portion of a Mortgaged Property by a State or any political subdivision or authority thereof, whether by legal proceeding or by agreement, the Borrower can be required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such extent, condemnation proceeds may not be required to be applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Borrower, if, immediately after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration) the fair market value of the   
 


  


D-10





  


 
real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining principal balance of the Mortgage Loan.
 
No Mortgage Loan that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is a Crossed Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties or a portion thereof, including pursuant to a condemnation, other than in compliance with the REMIC Provisions.
 




(28)


Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls.  Each Mortgage requires the Borrower to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) and annual operating statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) rent rolls for properties that have leases contributing more than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements, which annual financial statements with respect to each Mortgage Loan with more than one Borrower are in the form of an annual combined balance sheet of the Borrower entities (and no other entities), together with the related combined statements of operations, members’ capital and cash flows, including a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged Properties on a combined basis.



 




(29)


Acts of Terrorism Exclusion.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (collectively referred to as “TRIA”), from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each other Mortgage Loan, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to Seller’s knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Loan Documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto except to the extent that any right to require such coverage may be limited by commercial availability on commercially reasonable terms; provided, however, that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance is commercially available, the Borrower under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the Borrower shall not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than two times the amount of the insurance premium that is payable in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Loan Documents (without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance) at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds such amount, the Borrower is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such amount.

(30)


Due on Sale or Encumbrance.  Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a “due on sale” or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the related Loan Documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the lender which are customarily acceptable to the Seller lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than 50% in the related Borrower, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in the related Borrower, (iv) transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Borrower, a specific Person designated in the related Loan Documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v) transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies or (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraphs (27) and (32) herein, or (vii) by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted mezzanine debt in each case as set forth on Schedule D-1 to this Exhibit D or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any Companion Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is permitted under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money security interests, (iii) any Crossed Mortgage Loan as set forth on Schedule D-1 to this Exhibit D or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances.  The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Borrower is responsible for such payment along with all other reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.



 




(31)


Single-Purpose Entity.  Each Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding.  Both the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of the Borrower with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance in excess of $5 million provide that the Borrower is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel’s opinion regarding non-consolidation of the Borrower.  For this purpose, a “Single-Purpose Entity” shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance equal to $5 million or less, its organizational documents or the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents further provide, or which 



 


  


D-12





  


 
entity represented in the related Loan Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Borrower for a Crossed Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart from any other person or entity.
 




(32)


Defeasance.  With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant to the Loan Documents, can be defeased (a “Defeasance”), (i) the Loan Documents provide for Defeasance as a unilateral right of the Borrower, subject to satisfaction of conditions specified in the Loan Documents; (ii) the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years after the Closing Date; (iii) the Borrower is permitted to pledge only United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations, the revenues from which will, in the case of a full Defeasance, be sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance on the maturity date (or on or after the first date on which payment may be made without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment penalty) and if the Mortgage Loan permits partial releases of real property in connection with partial Defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient to pay all such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (a) 110% of the allocated loan amount for the real property to be released and (b) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan; (iv) the Borrower is required to provide a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral is sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Note as set forth in clause (iii) above; (v) if the Borrower would continue to own assets in addition to the Defeasance collateral, the portion of the Mortgage Loan secured by defeasance collateral is required to be assumed (or the mortgagee may require such assumption) by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vi) the Borrower is required to provide an opinion of counsel that the mortgagee has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior to any other claim or interest; and (vii) the Borrower is required to pay all rating agency fees associated with Defeasance (if rating confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all other reasonable expenses associated with Defeasance, including, but not limited to, accountant’s fees and opinions of counsel.



 




(33)


Fixed Interest Rates.  Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage Loan, except in situations where default interest is imposed.



 




(34)


Ground Leases.   For purposes of this Agreement, a “Ground Lease” shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such lease to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit.



 


  


D-13





  


 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber the related lessor’s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Seller, its successors and assigns, Seller represents and warrants that:
 




  


(a)


The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction.  The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related Mortgage;



 




  


(b)


The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or modified, or canceled or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the lender, and no such consent has been granted by the Seller since the origination of the Mortgage Loan except as reflected in any written instruments which are included in the related Mortgage File;



 




  


(c)


The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either Borrower or the mortgagee) that extends not less than 20 years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);



 




  


(d)


The Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii)  is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which the mortgagee on the lessor’s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject;



 




  


(e)


The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonable restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder, and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor;



 




  


(f)


The Seller has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease.  To the Seller’s knowledge, there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result in a material default under the



 


  


D-14





  


 
terms of such Ground Lease and to the Seller’s knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date;
 




  


(g)


The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the lender written notice of any default, and provides that no notice of default or termination is effective against the lender unless such notice is given to the lender;



 




  


(h)


A lender is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the lender’s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;



 




  


(i)


The Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Seller in connection with loans originated for securitization;



 




  


(j)


Under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee’s interest (other than (i) de minimis amounts for minor casualties or (ii) in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in clause (k) below) will be applied either to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold amount specified in the related Loan Documents) the lender or a trustee appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest;



 




  


(k)


In the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee’s interest in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and



 




  


(l)


Provided that the lender cures any defaults which are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease with lender upon termination of the Ground Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.



 




(35)


Servicing.  The servicing and collection practices used by the Seller with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects, legal and have met customary industry standards for servicing of commercial loans for conduit loan programs.



 


  


D-15





  


 




(36)


Origination and Underwriting.  The origination practices of the Seller (or the related originator if the Seller was not the originator) with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been, in all material respects, legal and as of the date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan and the origination thereof complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state or local law relating to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and warranty does not address or otherwise cover any matters with respect to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this Exhibit D.



 




(37)


No Material Default; Payment Record.  No Mortgage Loan has been more than 30 days delinquent, without giving effect to any grace or cure period, in making required payments since origination, and as of the date hereof, no Mortgage Loan is more than 30 days delinquent (beyond any applicable grace or cure period) in making required payments as of the Closing Date.  To the Seller’s knowledge, there is (a) no material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan, or (b) no event (other than payments due but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, in the case of either clause (a) or clause (b), materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan or the value, use or operation of the related Mortgaged Property, provided, however, that this representation and warranty does not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of an exception scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Seller in this Exhibit D.  No person other than the holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under the Loan Documents.



 




(38)


Bankruptcy.  As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, no Borrower, guarantor or tenant occupying a single-tenant property is a debtor in state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.



 




(39)


Organization of Borrower.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, in reliance on certified copies of the organizational documents of the Borrower delivered by the Borrower in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, the Borrower is an entity organized under the laws of a state of the United States of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Except with respect to any Crossed Mortgage Loan, no Mortgage Loan has a Borrower that is an Affiliate of another Borrower. (An “Affiliate” for purposes of this paragraph (39) means, a Borrower that is under direct or indirect common ownership and control with another Borrower.)



 




(40)


Environmental Conditions.  A Phase I environmental site assessment (or update of a previous Phase I and or Phase II site assessment) and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, a Phase II environmental site assessment (collectively, an “ESA”) meeting ASTM requirements conducted by a reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan within 12 months prior to its origination date (or an update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA either (i) did not identify the existence of recognized



 


  


D-16





  


 
environmental conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor, hereinafter “Environmental Condition”) at the related Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation with respect to any Environmental Condition that was identified, or (ii) if the existence of an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then at least one of the following statements is true:  (A) an amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant to be sufficient to cover the estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws or the Environmental Condition has been escrowed by the related Borrower and is held or controlled by the related lender; (B) if the only Environmental Condition relates to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or lead in drinking water, and the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required to be instituted by the related Borrower that can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C) the Environmental Condition identified in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior to the date hereof, and, if and as appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental regulatory authority (or the Environmental Condition affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental authority as “closed” or a reputable environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D) a secured creditor environmental policy or a pollution legal liability insurance policy that covers liability for the Environmental Condition was obtained from an insurer rated no less than A- (or the equivalent) by Moody’s, S&P and/or Fitch; (E) a party not related to the Borrower was identified as the responsible party for such Environmental Condition and such responsible party has financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation; or (F) a party related to the Borrower having financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation is required to take action.  To Seller’s knowledge, except as set forth in the ESA, there is no Environmental Condition (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor) at the related Mortgaged Property.
 




(41)


Appraisal.  The Servicing File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property with an appraisal date within 6 months of the Mortgage Loan origination date, and within 12 months of the Closing Date.  The appraisal is signed by an appraiser who is either a Member of the Appraisal Institute (“MAI”) and/or has been licensed and certified to prepare appraisals in the state where the Mortgaged Property is located. Each appraiser has represented in such appraisal or in a supplemental letter that the appraisal satisfies the requirements of the “Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice” as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation and has certified that such appraiser had no interest, direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the Borrower or in any loan made on the security thereof, and its compensation is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan.



 




(42)

(43)


Cross-Collateralization.  No Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with any mortgage loan that is outside the Trust.



 




(44)


Advance of Funds by the Seller.  After origination, no advance of funds has been made by Seller to the related Borrower other than in accordance with the Loan Documents, and, to Seller’s knowledge, no funds have been received from any person other than the related Borrower or an affiliate for, or on account of, payments due on the Mortgage Loan (other than as contemplated by the Loan Documents, such as, by way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, amounts paid by the tenant(s) into a lender-controlled lockbox if required or contemplated under the related lease or Loan Documents).  Neither Seller nor any affiliate thereof has any obligation to make any capital contribution to any Borrower under a Mortgage Loan, other than contributions made on or prior to the date hereof.



 




(45)


Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  Seller has complied in all material respects with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including without limitation the USA Patriot Act of 2001 with respect to the origination of the Mortgage Loan, the failure to comply with which would have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan.



 
For purposes of these representations and warranties, the phrases “the Seller’s knowledge” or “the Seller’s belief” and other words and phrases of like import shall mean, except where otherwise expressly set forth herein, the actual state of knowledge or belief of the Seller, its officers and employees directly responsible for the underwriting, origination, servicing or sale of the Mortgage Loans regarding the matters expressly set forth herein.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 27, 2017 - Lock
Today's Outlook
Judging from early market trends, it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge up today. However, those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a sharper rise, a holding steady, or even a fall all remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, including:

This morning's domestic economic data – Durable goods orders and international trade in goods were better than expected, though the former figure was inflated by one-time orders for aircraft. Meanwhile, the weekly jobless numbers were mildly disappointing.


The U.S. Treasury will be auctioning 7-year notes at 1:00 pm (ET).
Skittishness ahead of tomorrow's announcement of the first estimate of gross domestic product figures for 2017's second quarter.
Events on Capitol Hill as the U.S. Senate continues to debate health care reform. To some, the credibility of President Trump's wider business and tax agenda is at stake.

If we were currently buying a home, we would lock our rate now, at least if we had to lock anyway within the next couple of weeks. Read on to discover why you might prefer to float.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages inched down yesterday, giving some relief after Tuesday's sharp rise. They remain close to where they were between July 12-18. Rates could fall again but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming hours and days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to lock now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive June's and early July's rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

Quicken Loans Ranks Highest in Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction for Seventh Consecutive Year


 






COSTA MESA, Calif.: 10 Nov. 2016 — Overall satisfaction scores have increased year over year, but a high percentage of home buyers are remorseful about their mortgage lender selection, according to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study,SM released today.The study shows that 21% of customers purchasing a home express regret over their choice of lender, and 27% of first-time home buyers regret their choice. Among customers who regret their decision, there are two distinct situations.The first situation is customers having a poor experience (overall scores below 600 on a 1,000-point scale), which includes an above-average incidence of problems, lack of communication and unmet promises. While this group’s responses aren’t unexpected, they are often vocal about their displeasure, making an average of 9.0 negative comments, compared with the study average of 0.7.The second situation is more unexpected because satisfaction among these customers is high. This group tends to be very price-focused and frequently obtains multiple quotes. Among customers who regret their lender selection, 72% indicate they were pressured to choose a particular mortgage product. Their final lender choice is often linked to financial reasons, such as getting a lower rate because they have a relationship with the firm (e.g., checking account with direct deposit).“This ‘happy buyer’s remorse’ is in part due to customers feeling that circumstances out of their control drove them to a particular choice and that options weren’t totally clear,” said Craig Martin, director of the mortgage practice at J.D. Power. “Like a lot of consumers, they are happy with a good deal, but they can feel that they have to jump through hoops to get the deal. In the end, they may not fully understand exactly what they got, and the longer-term risk for lenders is that customers’ perceptions of the deal may change in the future.”One potential contributing factor to this condition could be TRID (TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure[1]).  Over the past two years, much of lenders’ attention has been focused on complying with and minimizing the negative effects of these new requirements, which became effective in October 2015. Lenders have feared that the new requirements would extend an already lengthy process and negatively affect satisfaction. While various sources have reported increases in the total number of days for the lending process, findings of the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study show little change in the perceived speed of the process. Improved communication and setting expectations appropriately have helped prevent negative perceptions.“Whether it is a new regulation, shifting rates or new technology, lenders will continue to face challenges that require them to change,” Martin said. “Regardless of what comes, if lenders focus on the needs of the customer and execute on key best practices they can positively influence perceptions and minimize the negative effects on customers.”Following are some of the key findings in this year’s study:A higher percentage of customers in 2016 indicate their loan representative always called back when promised, compared with last year (85% vs. 81%, respectively), and their loan closed on the desired date (81% vs. 79%).Satisfaction is significantly higher among customers buying a home (840) than among those refinancing (821). In the 2014 and 2015 studies, the levels of satisfaction in these groups were nearly identical.Technology is becoming increasingly important, with 28% of customers indicating they completed their detailed application online, up from 22% in 2015 and 18% in 2014. Study RankingsQuicken Loans ranks highest in primary mortgage origination satisfaction for a seventh consecutive year, with a score of 869. Quicken Loans performs particularly well in the application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; and onboarding factors.CitiMortgage moves up three positions from fifth in 2015 to second this year, with a score of 851.  Ditech Financial, new to the study in 2016, ranks third with a score of 849.Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (+52 points) and Nationstar Mortgage (+50 points) post the most significant year-over-year improvements in overall satisfaction.Advice to ConsumersPlan ahead when researching mortgage options. Satisfaction among customers who wait until they find a home to look into mortgage options is 92 points lower than among those who look into mortgage options before their home search.Take the time to obtain more than one quote. Among the 32% of customers who received just one quote, overall satisfaction is 19 points lower than those who get multiple quotes. Satisfaction is 38 points lower among first-time buyers only getting one quote vs. those who get multiple quotes.Choose a lender based on their merits, not just price or affiliation. Customers who say they chose their lender primarily because of price/rate or based on the recommendation of a realtor/builder are significantly less satisfied than those whose choice is based on other reasons.About the StudyThe 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study measures customer satisfaction with the mortgage origination experience in six factors (listed alphabetically): application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; onboarding; and problem resolution. Satisfaction is calculated on a 1,000-point scale.The study is based on responses from 5,182 customers who originated a new mortgage or refinanced within the past 12 months, and was fielded in July–August 2016.For more information about the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, visithttp://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-primary-mortgage-origination-satisfaction-study.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.comGeno Effler; Costa Mesa, Calif.; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.comAbout J.D.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
