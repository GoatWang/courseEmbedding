          What We Do
        




            What We Do
          

Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that follows decades of development from academic research, industry theory, and experimentation across an increasing image-centric and data-driven world. Today, deep learning technology is  rapidly advancing numerous fields such as biomedicine, telecommunication, transportation, and finance.


Cardiovascular disease accounts for one in every four deaths in the United States—approximately 610,000 people every year, according to the CDC1.

Medicine is emerging as one of deep learning’s biggest areas of human impact: it is used for genomic testing and sequencing, diagnostic image analysis, drug development, and early detection of disease. Doctors in the U.S. are already using algorithmic support to improve the speed and quality of medical decisions.
At Bay Labs, we believe that deep learning has potential to dramatically impact the leading cause of death—cardiovascular disease. In order to serve the largest number of people, we aim to amplify the benefits of deep learning by providing high-performance algorithmic capabilities to assist with healthcare challenges on a global scale.
