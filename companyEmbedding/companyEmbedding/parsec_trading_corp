TrakSYS is a proven platform, deployed at 5,500 sites in over 100 countries — and in a variety of industries, including pharmaceutical, food and beverage, packaged goods, and more.WATCH VIDEOOne Platform. Many Solutions.What can you do with TrakSYS? What can’t you do? TrakSYS is a unified manufacturing management software platform, with multiple, fully-integrated modules. Simply activate a combination of the powerful, pre-built modules to deliver specific solutions — from OEE to SPC, E-Records, Maintenance, Traceability, Workflow, and more — without the need for a new application, new servers, or costly coding. The features to power that functionality are already installed in your TrakSYS system. That’s what we mean by Manufacturing Management Simplified. PerformanceQualityMaintenanceView All Solutionsis TrakSYS right for you? don’t just take our word for it.“We were looking for a tool that would help us make better decisions that in turn would improve performance. In addition to having to fit with our company culture, another thing we wanted in our tracking system was flexibility. We wanted to be able to take the program out of the box and configure it to fit our needs. With some of the other options we looked at, the supplier took the position, ‘that is the way it works and the only way it works’. That was not the case with TrakSYS. Our operators had a lot of input into developing what the final solution looked like. Actually, we are still moving forward today, getting a little deeper and making our operations even more efficient. You could describe it as a living program.”Tony Peterson Operation ManagerVIEW CASE STUDY“Once TrakSYS was deployed, we were able to quickly and effectively evaluate the root causes of poor performance. The initial focus of the project was on improving productivity for lines responsible for hormonal products. Within the first 12 months after deploying TrakSYS, we had already improved average OEE by 100 percent.”Francisco Javier Production ManagerVIEW CASE STUDY“The tech support from Parsec is world class!

 PARSEC TRADING CORP swift code / bic code     WHAT IS A SWIFT / BIC CODE?A Swift Code is the standard format for Business Identifier Codes (BIC) and it's a unique identificationcode for banks and financial institutions globally. These codes are used when transferring money between banks,in particular for international wire transfers or SEPA payments.SWIFT code, BIC code, SWIFT ID or SWIFT - BIC (ISO 9362) is a standard format of Business Identifier Codes approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is a unique identification code for both financial and non-financial institutions. The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. When assigned to a non-financial institution, the code may also be known as a Business Entity Identifier or BEI. These codes are used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can sometimes be found on account statements. The overlapping issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 is discussed in the article International Bank Account Number (also called IBAN). The SWIFT network does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. In the process of the Single Euro Payments Area the European central banks have agreed on a common format based on IBAN and BIC including an XML-based transmission format for standardized transactions; the TARGET2 is a joint gross clearing system in the European Union that does not require the SWIFT network for transmission (see EBICS). The TARGET-directory lists all the BICs of the banks that are attached to the TARGET2-network being a subset of the SWIFT-directory of BICs.SWIFTCODES BY COUNTRYABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZPARSEC TRADING CORP swift codesBrowse through all available bank swift codes used by PARSEC TRADING CORPThe bic codes below belong to PARSEC TRADING CORP bank and/or any of its branches  across all countries and cities in the world.Swift codes also known as BIC Codes is a unique bank identifier used to verify financial transactions such as a Bank Wire Transfer.The bank swift code provides information about the bank and branch where the money should be transferred.
