Piedmont Partners Group Ventures, LLC (“PPGV”) is a private investment firm founded with a mission to be advocates for business leaders with transformational ideas. Founded in 2009 and based in the San Francisco Bay Area, PPGV seeks to partner with entrepreneurs and management teams who hold unique insights in their sectors and provide a long term view of creating value. Our goal is to bring these leaders our energy, creativity, activism, capital, and resources.  We avoid me-too strategies and prefer to back businesses that break ground with new business models and products.

PerspectivePPGV is passionate about structuring solutions to business challenges and working with management teams to realize growth or unlock hidden potential. Through our network of capital partners we are able to bring an eclectic portfolio of resources to management teams. From time to time, PPGV will explore and select ideas outside of our general parameters when opportunity knocks. We are a small team and cover only a limited number of industries, but we go extraordinarily deep in our research. Our history gives us a wealth of experience in international businesses focused on East and Southeast Asia,  as well as those closer to home.PPGV never expects deals to waltz in our front door.  Our day-to-day involves heading out to meet with managers and examine operations.  We prefer to act as both investors and advisors in transactions whenever possible.  For early stage start-ups and small-cap companies in need of critical thinking,  PPGV supports innovative entrepreneurs through mentoring and affiliation with Runway, a leading Bay Area business incubator.

The 21 PPGV Core Values:We are bound by our word, not just by the stuff we sign.We believe that curiosity is mankind’s best trait, followed closely by creativity…they are related.We are approachable and humble.We are investors first and financiers second.  If it doesn’t make sense to own, it doesn’t make sense to transact.We give our best to our companies, our investors, and our colleagues.We are both professional and informal—they are not mutually exclusive.We stand on the shoulders of others; learning from history is the basis of modern society.We hold fun and humor in highest regard.  We do what we do with a smile, because we find the work to be a pleasure. We believe it is one world, not America and everyone else. Go out and seek the opportunity, wherever it may be.We tinker to make things better, more beautiful, more complete…work is never, really, done.We are almost never purveyors of out-of-the-box solutions, and standard efforts.  If that is all you need we can refer you.We love a challenge.  Tell us it can’t be done and we are off and running.We believe that trust and friendship is earned.  We invest time in relationships, often a lot of time.We believe in diversity.  We are all one.We celebrate our victories and learn from our failures.  We don’t hire and we generally seek to avoid the arrogant, self-impressed or entitled.We start with the question why, then we challenge the assumptions in the data, then we get lunch.We are committed to a life of self and organizational improvement with the following goals: inspiring confidence from our clients, accuracy in our analysis, transparency in our processes, and delivery on commitments.We focus.  If you don’t hear from us for a few weeks, we are probably focused.  It is the only way we know to deliver on commitments and achieve our objectives.Above all, we don’t take ourselves any more seriously than is absolutely necessary.

Technology PPGV is focused on technologies that fuel creativity and improve quality of life. We remain fascinated with tools that facilitate image processing and empower designers. PPGV is also engaged with technologies that enhance energy efficiency and stewardship of our environment.CleantechPPGV is determined to counteract climate change in any way we can and believes supporting the growth of renewable energy industries is crucial.  Toward this end we have donated our time to the US DOE’s Sunshot Initiative to inspire and finance new clean energy companies, by judging competitions and mentoring entrepreneurs. We have also made meaningful investments in the space, including California-based Sungevity and BrightCurrent.MediaPPGV feels passionately that there is little so linked to the quality of human life as much as the free flow of ideas, literature, music, art, theater and film.  In the context of rapidly changing business models for media delivery, particularly for news and music, PPGV seeks to invest in technologies and strategies that keep these arenas rich and vital.Health Care  PPGV is committed to the modernization of the US health care system—from care delivery to efficiency of processing. We actively invest in medical technologies and therapies associated with a higher future standard of care. We advise and consult to those with unique visions for improvement of the U.S. health care system and those who present ideas for higher quality, lower cost and more universal delivery of health services.Education PPGV seeks to encourage new ideas on education at every level. We are excited about those organizations that bring meaningful experiences to children and teenagers that inform their careers and life choices. From tools, to publishing, to content delivery, we see this sector as one still in its early stages and as one that will reward new thinking and investment.Entrepreneurial FinancePPGV expects financial services to remain a rapidly evolving sector and we are engaged with managers and product developers with novel solutions to investment problems. We are focused on products that allow for more efficient diversification, greater international participation, access to credit and free movement of funds. We advise clients on the most efficient and modern methods to manage their platforms and seek outperformance. In particular, we are well-versed in Asian products and non-traditional asset categories.Consumer GoodsPPGV is passionate about the potential for innovative strategies and novel products to transform the consumer experience. Our team has decades of experience in this arena and a diversity of case studies to reference in guiding clients. We have focused our research on US and Asian supply and distribution chains.  Business ServicesPPGV believes that service organizations play a vital role in the global economy.  They make businesses more flexible and efficient, and allow organizations to focus on their core arena of competence.  We have been active in service business supporting health care, financial services, and the legal industry.Industrial and Building MaterialsPPGV sees a growing opportunity to acquire assets from industrial holding companies that own broad portfolios. We find many situations where new leadership, business discipline and improved technology can breathe life and enhance profitability of businesses.
