(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" above for certain information concerning those forward-looking statements.  Overview  YOU On Demand is a premium Video On Demand ("VOD") service provider with primary operations in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"). YOU On Demand Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004.  YOU On Demand, through its subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities, provides enhanced premium content and integrated value-added service solutions for the delivery of VOD and paid video programming to digital cable providers, Internet Protocol Television ("IPTV") providers, Over-the-Top ("OTT") streaming providers, mobile manufacturers and operators, as well as direct to customers.  We launched our VOD service through the acquisition of YOD Hong Kong, formerly Sinotop Group Limited, on July 30, 2010. Through a series of contractual agreements, YOD WFOE, the subsidiary of YOD Hong Kong, controls Beijing Sino Top Scope Technology Co., Ltd. ("Sinotop Beijing"), a corporation established in the PRC. Sinotop Beijing is the 80% owner of Zhong Hai Shi Xun Information Technology Co., Ltd. ("Zhong Hai Video"), though which we provide: 1) integrated value-added business-to-business ("B2B") service solutions for the delivery of VOD and enhanced premium content for digital cable; 2) integrated value-added business-to-business-to-customer ("B2B2C") service solutions for the delivery of enhanced premium content for IPTV and OTT providers and; 3) a direct to user, or B2C, mobile video service app. As a result of the contractual arrangements with Sinotop Beijing, we have the right to control management decisions and direct the economic activities that most significantly impact Sinotop Beijing and Zhong Hai Video, and accordingly, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), we consolidate these operating entities in our consolidated financial statements.  Recent Development  On July 6, 2016, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the "SSW SPA") with SSW, a Korea company and an affiliate of SSS. Pursuant to the terms of the SSW SPA, the Company has agreed to sell and issue 2,272,727 shares of the Company's common stock, for $1.76 per share, or a total purchase price of $4.0 million to SSW. A total of $4.0 million was received on July 19, 2016.  On August 11, 2016, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Harvest SPA") with Harvest Alternative Investment Opportunities SPC ("Harvest"), a Cayman Islands company. Pursuant to the terms of the Harvest SPA, the Company has agreed to sell and issue 2,272,727 shares of the Company's Common Stock, for $1.76 per share, or a total purchase price of $4.0 million to Harvest. A total of $4.0 million was received on August 12, 2016.  Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance  Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:   Our ability to adapt our product and service offerings to meet consumer demands. Our expansion prospect is dependent on continued development of our product and services. The content distribution industry in China is highly competitive and dominated by large Internet companies that have more resources than us. The growth of our business will depend on whether we can develop new services and products that can offer higher quality contents, technological innovation and unique user experience.   Our ability to expand our subscriber base. Our business is affected by the overall size of our user base, which in turn is determined by, among other factors, (i) user experience of our service and products, (ii) our relationship with distribution platforms, such as digital cable and IPTV providers and mobile product manufacturers, (iii) expansion of our business to include increased service offerings and (iv) the expansion of our subscribers beyond smartphones to mobile tablets and other Internet-enabled mobile devices.   Our ability to achieve revenue growth and meet internal or external expectations of future performance. In the latter half of 2013, we shifted our focus to our core multi-platform video streaming services and our business model is still evolving. Our financial performance is affected by, among other things, our ability to come to favorable business terms with our distribution partners, manage and procure contents in a cost-effective manner and manage our operating expenses. Overall, our normalized operating expenses have been decreasing but we have also incurred certain additional costs related to our financing activities, maintaining our public company status and making staff reductions.   Changes in China's economic, political or social policies or conditions. We operate in China and derive all of our revenues from sales to customers in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operation is significantly influenced by the political, social and economic policies and conditions in China. While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decade, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating telecommunication and Internet industry development by imposing certain laws and regulations concerning Internet access and distribution of video content and other information over traditional and new media platforms. Some of the laws and regulations are also relatively new and involving and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty.  Taxation  United States  YOU On Demand Holdings, Inc. is subject to United States tax. No provision for income taxes in the United States has been made as YOU On Demand Holdings, Inc. had no income taxable in the United States since inception.  Cayman Islands  CB Cayman was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, it is not subject to income or capital gains tax. In addition, dividend payments are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands.  Hong Kong  Our subsidiary, YOD Hong Kong, was incorporated in Hong Kong and under the current laws of Hong Kong, is subject to Profits Tax of 16.5% . No provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax has been made as YOD Hong Kong has no taxable income.  The People's Republic of China  Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, our Chinese subsidiaries and VIEs are subject to an earned income tax of 25.0% .  Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income and non-tax deductible expenses incurred. Our management carefully monitors these legal developments to determine if there will be any change in the statutory income tax rate.  Aug 15, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

ITEM 7. 
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
      FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following managements discussion and analysis should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the
other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to
historical information, the following discussion contains certain
forward-looking information. See Special Note Regarding Forward Looking
Statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking
statements.
Overview
We operate in the Chinese media segment, through our Chinese
subsidiaries and VIEs a business which provides integrated value-added service
solutions for the delivery of Video On Demand ("VOD") and enhanced premium content for cable
providers.
Through our VIE, Sinotop, and its 80% owned operating joint
venture Zhong Hai Video, we provide integrated value-added service solutions for
the delivery of VOD, and enhanced premium content for cable providers. Zhong Hai
Video's revenue will be derived primarily from a VOD model, consisting of a fee
to view movies, popular titles and live events. At year end our VOD product was
implemented on a limited basis for testing. Our full product launch occurred in
conjunction with the Chinese New Year during our first quarter of 2013. Full
roll out of our video on demand products began in the first quarter of 2013.
Through Shandong Media, we operate our publishing business,
which includes the distribution of periodicals, the publication of advertising,
the organization of public relations events, the provision of information
related services, copyright transactions, the production of audio and video
products, and the provision of audio value added communication services.
Shandong Media's revenue consists primarily of sales of publications and
advertising revenues. The Company has deconsolidated the net assets of Shandong
Media as of July 1, 2012 and accounts for the remaining 30% interest in Shandong
Media by the equity method.
As discussed further below under Discontinued Operations, the
operating results of Jinan Broadband have been retrospectively reclassified as
discontinued operations.
Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial
Performance
Our operating results are primarily affected by the following
factors:


 

Growth in the Chinese Economy. We operate
      in China and derive all of our revenues from sales to customers in China.
      Economic conditions in China, therefore, affect virtually all aspects of
      our operations, including the demand for our products, the availability
      and prices of our supplies and our other expenses. China has experienced
      significant economic growth, achieving an average annual growth rate of
      approximately 10% in gross domestic product from 1996 through 2011. China
      is expected to experience continued growth in all areas of investment and
      consumption, even in the face of a global economic recession. However,
      China has not been entirely immune to the global economic slowdown and is
      experiencing a slowing of its growth rate. 

 

 

 

 

 

PRC Economic Stimulus Plans. The PRC
      government has issued a policy entitled Central Government Policy
      On Stimulating Domestic Consumption To Counter The Damage Result
      From Export Business Of The Country , pursuant to which the PRC
      Central Government is dedicating approximately $580 billion to stimulate
      domestic consumption. Companies that are either directly or indirectly
      related to construction, and to the manufacture and sale of building
      materials, electrical household appliances and telecommunication
      equipment, are expected to benefit. We could potentially benefit if the
      stimulus plan injects funds into cable infrastructure allowing access to
      our PPV network. 

 

 

 

 

 

Deployment of Value-added Services. To
      augment our product offerings and create other revenue sources, we work
      with strategic partners to deploy value-added services to our cable
      customers. Value-added services, including but not limited to the
      synergies created by the additions of our new assets, will become a focus
      of revenue generation for our company. No assurance can be made that we
      will add other value-added services, or if added, that they will succeed.
      




Taxation

United States

YOU On Demand Holdings, Inc. is subject to United States tax at a tax rate of 34%. No provision for income taxes in the United States has been made as YOU On Demand Holdings, Inc. had no income taxable in the United States.

Cayman Islands

CB Cayman was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Under the current law of the Cayman Islands, it is not subject to income or capital gains tax. In addition, dividend payments are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands.

Hong Kong

Our subsidiary, Sinotop Hong Kong, was incorporated in Hong Kong and under the current laws of Hong Kong, is subject to Profits Tax of 16.5% . No provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax has been made as Sinotop Hong Kong has no taxable income.

The People’s Republic of China

Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, our Chinese subsidiaries and VIEs are subject to an earned income tax of 25.0%.

Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income and non-tax deductible expenses incurred. Our management carefully monitors these legal developments to
determine if there will be any change in the statutory income tax rate.

The information provided below represents pro forma amounts
for 2011 to exclude the impact of Shandong Media, which was deconsolidated
effective July 1, 2012 (see Note 12 to the audited financial statements included
in this report for more information on the Deconsolidation of Shandong Media)
.
Revenues

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, totaled $5,000, as compared to $23,000 for 2011. Our revenue in both 2012 and 2011 represents the development of our VOD business which we expect to begin generating
increased revenue in future
periods.

Gross Loss

Our gross  loss for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2,227,000, as compared to $387,000 during 2011. The
increase in gross  loss of approximately $1,840,000, or 475%, is mainly due to
an increase in amortization of
content costs related to our VOD business.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012, increased approximately $2,049,000 to $8,677,000, as compared to $6,628,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is mainly due to
increased costs related to the development of our VOD business.

Salaries and personnel costs are the primary components of selling, general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2012, salaries and personnel costs accounted for 58% of our selling, general and administrative expenses. For
the year ended December 31, 2012, salaries and personnel costs totaled $5,073,000, an increase of $1,382,000, or 37%, as compared to $3,691,000 for the same period of 2011. The increase in our salaries and personnel costs increased
because of the growth and development of our VOD business.

The other major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing and promotions, technology, rent and travel. For the year ended December 31, 2012, these costs totaled $2,363,000, an increase of $613,000, or
35% as compared to $1,750,000 in 2011. The increase is mainly due to the growth and development of our VOD business.

Professional Fees

Professional fees are generally related to public company reporting and governance expenses as well as legal fees related to our VOD business. Our costs for professional fees decreased $755,000, or 36%, to $1,342,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2012, from $2,097,000 during 2011. Such decrease in professional fees was primarily due to increased legal fees in 2011during the early stages of development of our VOD business.

Depreciation and Amortization

Our depreciation expense increased $116,000, or 82%, to $258,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012, from $142,000 during 2011. The increase is due to ongoing investment in our VOD business.
Depreciation expense at our Jinan Broadband subsidiary
(discontinued operations) decreased $465,000, or 21%, to $1,774,000 in the year
ended December 31, 2012 from $2,239,000 during 2011.
Our amortization expense increased $86,000, or 5%, to $1,843,000
in the year ended December 31, 2012, from $1,757,000 during 2011. The increase
is due to software, licenses and website development costs being recognized in
2012. Amortization expense at our Jinan Broadband subsidiary (discontinued
operations) increased $64,000, or 74%, to $150,000 in the year ended December
31, 2012 from $86,000 during 2012.

Right to Purchase Expense

FIL Investment Management (Hong Kong) Limited (“Fidelity”), a professional fiduciary for various accounts, had the right to purchase up to 5,625,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the June 7, 2011 private placement. We recorded a
charge of $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $194,000 for the same period of 2011, related to the valuation of this right to purchase.

Cost of Reset Provision

As a result of the negative clawback provisions included in our warrant agreements associated with our August 2012 private financings, we have reset the exercise price from $4.25 per share to $1.50 per share. Accordingly, we valued the cost
of this reset provision and recorded a charge to operations of $659,000 for the year ended December 31,
2012.




Change in Fair value of Warrant Liabilities

Our warrants are characterized as derivative liabilities to be re-measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations and, accordingly, we reported a gain of $647,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2012. The gain is primarily due to the decrease in our closing stock price.

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

Our contingent consideration related to our acquisition of Sinotop Hong Kong is classified as a liability because the earn-out securities do not meet the fixed-for-fixed criteria under ASC 815-40-15. Further, ASC 815-40-15 requires us to re-measure
at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in the statement of operations and, accordingly, we reported a gain of approximately $1,313,000 and $3,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The gain is primarily due to decreases in our closing stock price.

Loss on Investment Write-off

In 2011, we entered into a purchase agreement with “Shandong Fu Ren” whereby we were obligated to pay approximately $157,000 to acquire 51% ownership of Shanghai Tianduo. We advanced approximately $47,000 in 2011. Since we
entered into the agreement in 2011, the direction of our company has changed and thus the value of the investment has diminished. As such, as of December 31, 2012, we wrote-off the initial investment of $47,000 and accrued a liability
of $48,000 as an expected settlement payment to terminate the agreement for a total of $95,000. In addition, in connection with the investment we advanced funds in the form of a loan for $40,000 which we wrote-off and recorded as loss on
uncollectible loan.

Gain on Deconsolidation of Shandong Media

Effective July 1, 2012, we deconsolidated our ownership in Shandong Media and recorded a gain of $141,814 as discussed in Note 12 of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Discontinued Operations
On May 20, 2013, we entered into an Equity Transfer Agreement
with Shandong Broadcast Network (Shandong Broadcast) pursuant to which the
parties conditionally agreed to the sale to Shandong Broadcast of our 51% equity
interest in Jinan Broadband. The sale of Jinan Broadband was completed on July
31, 2013. As discussed in our Current Report on Form 8-k filed with the SEC on
February 5, 2014, we have updated operating results for all periods covered in
the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31,
2013 (as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 2013), in
order to reflect retrospective reclassification of results for its Jinan
Guangdian Jia He Broadband.,Ltd. operations in discontinued operations. Included
in our operating results for Jinan Broadband was a charge for impairment on long
lived assets for $840,000. Our Jinan Broadband business was sold in order to
focus on our core VOD business and help with cash flow needs.


Net Loss Attributable to Non-controlling Interest

49% of the operating loss of our Jinan Broadband subsidiary is allocated to Shandong Cable (previously Jinan Parent), the 49% co-owner of this business. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $1,278,000 of our operating losses from Jinan
Broadband was allocated to Jinan Parent, as compared to $705,000 during the same period of 2011. Effective July 31, 2013, the Company sold its 51% interest in Jinan Broadband.
See discontinued operations footnote 4 to our financial statements included in
Exhibit 99.2.

20% of the operating loss of our Zhong Hai Video joint venture is allocated to Hua Cheng, our 20% joint venture partner. During the year ended December 31, 2012, $399,000 of our operating loss from Zhong Hai Video was allocated to Hua Cheng, as
compared to $420,000 during the same period of 2011.

Deemed Dividends on Preferred Stock

We recorded a beneficial conversion feature associated with the Series C Preferred Stock, which was limited to the proceeds allocated to them. Because the preferred stock is immediately convertible at the option of the holder, we recorded deemed
dividends of $924,000 from the beneficial conversion feature associated with the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3,278,000. Approximately $346,000 is held in our Chinese subsidiaries. The
Company has no plans to repatriate these funds. We had a working capital deficit at
December 31, 2012, of approximately $7,117,000.

The following table provides a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.

Operating Activities
The increase in cash used in operating activities relates to
corporate and operational costs incurred primarily in the development of our VOD
business.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was used primarily for (i)
additions to property and equipment of $954,000 and $2,547,000 in 2012 and 2011,
respectively, and (ii) investments in intangibles of $273,000 and $443,000 in
2011 and 2012, respectively.
Financing activities
In 2012, the Company received a $3,000,000 loan from our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Shane McMahon. Also in 2012, we
received net proceeds of $5,660,000 from the sale of our equity securities as
discussed in Notes 16 and 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements
included in this report. For 2011, the amount consisted primarily of proceeds
received from the sale of our equity securities from our June 2011
financings.
We anticipate that we will need to raise additional funds to
fully implement our business model and related strategies. We believe we have
the ability to raise funds by various methods including utilization of our $50
million shelf registration as well as other means of financing. The fact that we
have incurred significant continuing losses and continue to rely on debt and
equity financings to fund our operations to date, could raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. The audited consolidated
financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As of
December 31, 2012 the Company has an accumulated operating loss of approximately
$59 million.
Effects of Inflation
Inflation and changing prices have had an effect on our
business and we expect that inflation or changing prices could materially affect
our business in the foreseeable future. Our management will closely monitor the
price change and make efforts to maintain effective cost control in
operations.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is
material to an investor in our securities.

Seasonality
Our operating results and operating cash flows historically
have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however,
as a result of new market opportunities or new product introductions.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our
management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts
reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments
and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that
are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting
policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and
results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations
and require managements difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a
result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting
estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial
statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the
estimate may differ significantly from managements current judgments. We
believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant
estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements:


 
Variable Interest Entities. We
      account for entities qualifying as VIEs in accordance with FASB Topic
      810,Consolidation . VIEs are required to be consolidated by the
      primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the
      majority of the beneficial interests in the variable interest entity. A
      VIE is an entity for which the primary beneficiarys interest in the
      entity can change with changes in factors other than the amount of
      investment in the entity. 

 
  

 
Revenue Recognition. Revenue is
      recorded as services are provided to customers. We generally recognize all
      revenue in the period in which the service is rendered, provided that
      persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the
      sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably
      assured. We record deferred revenue for payments received from customers
      for the performance of future services and recognizes the associated
      revenue in the period that the services are performed.





 

Licensed Content. The Company obtains
      content through content license agreements and revenue sharing agreements
      with studios and distributors. The license agreement may or may not be
      recognized in licensed content. When the license fee is not known or
      reasonably determinable for a specific title, the title does not meet the
      criteria for recognition in licensed content in accordance with Financial
      Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)
      Topic 920, Entertainment  Broadcasters . In the event, the license
      fee is not known or reasonably determinable for a specific title in
      content license agreements that do not specify the license fee per title,
      we expense as costs of revenues the greater of revenue sharing costs
      incurred through the end of the reporting period or the proportionate
      value of total minimum license fees expensed on a straight-line basis over
      the term of each license agreement. As the Company expenses license fees
      on a straight-line basis, it may result in deferred or prepaid license
      fees. Prepaid license fees are classified as an asset on the consolidated
      balance sheets as licensed content and deferred license fees are
      classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred
      license fees. 



 

 

Intangible Assets and Goodwill. We account
      for intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with ASC 350,
      Intangibles- Goodwill and Other . ASC 350 requires that
      goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be
      amortized, but instead be evaluated for impairment at least annually. ASC
      350 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be
      amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for
      impairment whenever events indicate the carrying amount may not be
      recoverable. In accordance with ASC 350, goodwill is allocated to
      reporting units, which are either the operating segment or one reporting
      level below the operating segment. On an annual basis, we review goodwill
      for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether
      the existence of events or circumstances makes it more likely than not
      that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
      If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
      reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is further
      tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated
      fair value of its reporting units, determined using externally quoted
      prices (if available) or a discounted cash flow model and, when deemed
      necessary, a market approach. 



 

 

Foreign Currency Translation. The
      businesses of our operating subsidiaries are currently conducted in and
      from China in Renminbi. The Company makes no representation that any
      Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted
      into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate,
      the rates stated below, or at all. The Chinese government imposes control
      over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of
      the conversion of Renminbi into foreign exchange and through restrictions
      on foreign trade. The Company uses the U.S. dollar as its reporting and
      functional currency. Translation adjustments are reported as other
      comprehensive income or expenses and accumulated as other comprehensive
      income in the equity section of the balance sheet. Financial information
      is translated into U.S. dollars at prevailing or current rates
      respectively, except for revenues and expenses which are translated at
      average current rates during the reporting period. Exchange gains and
      losses resulting from retained profits are reported as a separate
      component of stockholders equity. 



 

 

Business Combinations. We account for
      acquisitions according to ASC 805, Business Combinations. ASC 805
      requires that upon initially obtaining control, an acquirer should
      recognize 100% of the fair values of acquired assets, including goodwill
      and assumed liabilities, with only limited exceptions, even if the
      acquirer has not acquired 100% of its target. Additionally, contingent
      consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and
      included on that basis in the purchase price consideration and transaction
      costs will be expensed as incurred. This statement also modifies the
      recognition for pre- acquisition contingencies, such as environmental or
      legal issues, restructuring plans and acquired research and development
      value in purchase accounting. This statement amends ASC 740-10, Income
      Taxes , to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of
      its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business
      combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of
      the combination or directly in contributed capital, depending on the
      circumstances. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but
not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a
material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

Career[edit]
Ng's work in Asian media began in the mid-1990s, as a proliferation of satellite space and a spate of programming piracy during this time inspired huge efforts by many mass media firms, most notably Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., to develop presences in Asian media markets.[2]
Wilton Group, PLC[edit]
Working as deputy chairman of Wilton Group, PLC, a former consumer goods distribution firm based in London, UK, that transitioned to media and entertainment investment and finance, Ng spearheaded the company's entry into Asian media markets.
In a 1994 joint-venture partnership with Hong Kong–based Shaw Brothers Ltd (formerly Shaw Media Corp. and owners of Shaw Brothers Studio, Hong Kong's largest film production company), Ng's Wilton team financed the establishment of a Chinese-language satellite television channel for Chinese-speaking communities in Europe called Chinese Channel. It was the first European network of its kind, broadcasting programs primarily produced by Hong Kong Television Broadcasting Ltd, the world's largest Chinese-language entertainment producer at the time.[2]
Later in 1994, Ng acquired for Wilton a 20% stake in the Asian interests of Denver-based cable television operator United International Holdings (now Liberty Global), with which Ng had worked previously while managing a Denver investment fund. He then set up a joint venture between UIH and United Artists Theatres, then the United States' largest cinema operator, to open a series of cineplexes in key cities in Asia. The first was in the Bugis Junction shopping mall in Singapore, followed by six other locations.[2]
Pacific Media, PLC[edit]
In the late 90s, Wilton Group became Pacific Media, PLC. Ng was appointed CEO in 1999, when the company was experiencing a period of financial turmoil. Soon after his appointment as CEO, Ng negotiated an investment deal with Hong Kong Supernet, an Asian Internet provider, that precipitated a 1.89m HKP surge in pre-tax profits, greatly bolstering the financial health and reputation of the company.[3]
Upon being named CEO, Ng transformed Pacific Media into a "shell" company and used it to invest in new Asian Internet ventures beginning in 2000. He secured financing from American investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston, and set forth a £70 million plan.[4][5]
Asiacontent.com[edit]
One major result of these "shell" investments was the acquisition of internet company Asiacontent.com, which went public during the bursting of the dot-com bubble in April 2000 to become one of the first Asian initial public offerings to be listed on NASDAQ.[6]
Prior to going public, in January 2000, Ng, with funding from Goldman Sachs,[7] led Asiacontent into a joint venture with NBC Internet Inc (or NBCi), then the Internet arm of the American television network NBC, to create a series of websites in South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan that would combine search engine functionality, news feeds and shopping links into sites similar to those of Yahoo!, the worldwide leader at the time. This came on the heels of similar successful NBCi ventures in Italy and France.[8][9]
Under Ng's tenure as chairman of Asiacontent, the company also entered into many other major joint ventures in Asian media markets, and Asiacontent soon became the largest distributor of global content in Asia.[10]
Among the partnerships were:

DoubleClick Inc., an Internet advertising network which sold online advertising space to marketers. The venture formed a new company, DoubleClick Asia, in an effort to capitalise on a late-90s Asian Internet advertising boom.[11]
MTV Asia, the television network's Asian arm, and MTVi Group, its interactive division. The partnership with Ng's Asiacontent created new Chinese and Korean web presences for MTV.[12]
CBS Sportsline, which joined with Asiacontent to create a network of sports-related websites throughout Asia, including Singapore and Korea.[13][14]
CNET and Asiacontent produced a series of Asian-language CNET sites across the region.[15]
Licensing agreements to bring E!Online and France's Fashion TV to Asia.[16]

Toward the end of 2000, amid the souring tech economy, Ng and Asiacontent Chief Executive Chris Justice expanded the company with an Internet solutions arm called Asiacontent Solutions, which offered web development and content management services for the Asian web presences of companies such as Sun Microsystems, Hachette Filipacchi, and L'Oréal.[17]
In the years after the bursting of the dot-com bubble and ensuing stock market turmoil, Pacific Media soon became financially troubled. Media firm MediaXposure then invested $20 million in the flagging company in 2003 to keep it operational through the first quarter of 2004. In late 2006, after Pacific Media had regained its financial stability, Ng resigned from Pacific Media's board of directors to pursue other interests.[18]
8 Holdings[edit]
After leaving Pacific Media, Ng formed his own investment holding company, 8 Holdings, which specialised in mergers and acquisitions of Asian media companies. In 8 Holdings' largest deal, Ng joined in 2005 with Harlan Kleiman, former head of programming for US cable television network HBO, to co-ordinate investors in the acquisition of Chinese television advertising company China Media Network by Metaphor Corp. Ng was named CEO of Metaphor Corp. as part of the acquisition.[19]
Investment in feature films[edit]
Ng has also invested in major motion pictures directed by Oliver Stone, including 1993's Heaven & Earth, the final in Stone's trilogy of films focused on the Vietnam War; and 1994's Natural Born Killers.
Fashion Networks International LLC[edit]
In 2009, Ng became chairman and principal shareholder of Fashion Networks International LLC, a digital media channel consisting of a network of fashion related websites and blogs. Fashion Networks' properties include NowManifest, Freshnet. NowManifest, a curated blog portal, boasts bloggers Anna Dello Russo, editor at large and creative consultant for Vogue Japan, Bryan Grey Yambao, and Derek Blasberg.[20] Fashion Networks International was acquired by Fairchild Fashion Media in May 2012.[21]
China Broadband, Inc. and YOU On Demand (CBBD.OB)[edit]
Ng was a founding partner and served as Executive chairman of China Broadband, Inc., now known as YOU on Demand Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:YOD), a national pay-per-view and video-on-demand platform in the People's Republic of China.[22] China Broadband, Inc.'s common stock gained approval for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board on 20 December 2007 and changed its name to YOU on Demand Holdings, Inc. in February 2011.[23]
YOU on Demand is the first of its kind in China, offering high quality movies to customers across the country through its Near Video on Demand (NVOD), Video on Demand (VOD) and Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) services. Through its subsidiaries the Company engages in value-added services for cable providers, cable broadband, and publishing businesses in China. YOU on Demand is headquartered in New York, NY, with its China headquarters in Beijing.[24]
Ng resigned from his post in 2010 to pursue other endeavours.[22]
China Cablecom[edit]
Clive Ng is Founder and Executive chairman of China Cablecom Holdings, a joint-venture provider of cable television services in the People's Republic of China. The Company was founded in October 2006 and was approved for listing onto the NASDAQ Capital Markets on 30 July 2008.
In September 2007, China Cablecom gained operating rights of the Binzhou Broadcasting network in Binzhou, Shandong Province. China Cablecom entered into a series of asset purchase and services agreements with a company organised by State Owned Enterprises ("SOE"), owned directly or indirectly by local branches of China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television ("SARFT"), in five different municipalities to serve as a holding company of the relevant businesses.
Pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger, Jaguar, a special purpose acquisition company merged with and into China Cablecom Holdings, Ltd., its wholly owned British Virgin Islands subsidiary, for the purpose of re-domesticating Jaguar to the British Virgin Islands on 9 April 2008. This merger was the first of its kind for a US public company.
In May 2008, China Cablecom issued convertible notes with a principal value of $43,175,000 along with 1,524,994 shares of ordinary shares to a number of investors. China Cablecom also announced its achievement of "Foreign Private Issuer" status, for purposes of the rules and regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the company declared its entrance into a framework agreement with Hubei Chutian Broadcasting and Television Networks Co., Ltd., a local state-owned enterprise owned by the Hubei branches of SARFT. This act established a cable TV operation joint venture.
On 18 June 2008, China Cablecom announced the completion of the first phase, of its framework agreement with Hubei Chutian Broadcasting and Television Networks Co., Ltd., to acquire a 60 percent economic interest in Hubei Chutian Video & Information Network. This consummation secured over 800,000 additional paying subscribers for China Cablecom. Phase two would represent an additional 800,000 paying subscribers and is pending further due diligence and execution of definitive agreements.
On 9 October 2009, the Company underwent comprehensive restructuring of its outstanding debt obligations with holders of its Hubei assets and of its debt securities and majority holders of its ordinary shares. The restructuring strengthened the Company's balance sheet by reducing the overall principal amount of its long-term debt obligations and eliminated cash interest obligations on the new debt securities issued in exchange for its outstanding notes. Simultaneous to the restructuring, China Cablecom announced placement of $33 million in senior secured notes used to satisfy the Company's remaining obligations to the Hubei SOE under its amended framework agreement.
On 3 April 2012, the Company reported that, as per its previous announcement, the Company's joint venture partner Hubei Chutian Radio & Television Information Network Company Limited ("Hubei SOE") has agreed to purchase its Hubei assets for a total of RMB 374 million. The Company is pleased to announce today that it has received the first payment of RMB 50 million. In accordance to the terms of the agreement, the Company has signed a JV Termination agreement with Hubei Chutian Shi Xun Network Company Limited ("Hubei JV").
The company has announced that it will use proceeds of the sale to reduce the Company's outstanding debt and any excess proceeds will be used to increase shareholder value going forward. On 20 October 2011, the Company announced that it had received an offer from its joint venture partners to purchase its assets in Hubei. The acceptance by China Cablecom for the offer was mandated by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) and made in compliance with provincial regulatory policies.
On 15 November 2012, China Cablecom Holdings, Ltd. ("China Cablecom" or the "Company") ( OTCBB : CABLF ) announced that it has completed the redemption on the Company's principal note obligations. The notes paid in full include $19.1 million in senior secured, $16.2 million in junior secured, and $4.2 million in unsecured notes. The Board was pleased with the conclusion of the redemption and feel that their job as board members has been fulfilled upon the repayment of its notes. As a result, the Company announced the resignation of three of its Board members effective immediately. Mr. Robi Hartman, Mr. David Kratochvil, and Mr. Jacob Weiss have agreed to step down following the liquidation of China Cablecom's Hubei assets. "The Company appreciates the contributions made by Mr. Hartman, Mr. Kratochvil, and Mr. Weiss," says Pu Yue, chief executive officer of China Cablecom. "They have individually served the Board with invaluable and insightful guidance and we wish them the best in their future success."

YOU On Demand Holdings Inc.



09/19/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 09/19/2016 15:08
YOU On Demand Signs Non-Binding Term Sheet with Sun Video Group to Purchase 51% of M.Y. Products, LLC and Announces Corporate Name Change from YOU On Demand to WeCast Network, Inc.







NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --



The Company has signed a non-binding Term Sheet with Sun Video Group HK Limited ("SVG") for 51% purchase of M.Y. Products, LLC ("MYP"), a video commerce and supply chain management operator, in exchange for $50 million worth of YOD common stock and $800k cash.


SVG guarantees MYP will achieve $200 million cumulative top line revenue and gain profitability, within 12 months of closing.


If MYP fails to meet the guarantee, then SVG shall forfeit back to the Company the YOD common stock it received, on a pro-rata basis. The shares will be held in escrow until the guarantee is met.


MYP is 100% owned by SVG, an affiliate of YOD's Chairman, Bruno Wu, and Sun Seven Stars ("SSS").


ADDITIONALLY, the Company is changing its corporate name to WeCast Network, Inc., which will become effective in Q4 (specific date to be announced).


The Company will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange but under the newsymbol WCST(specific date to be announced) with no change in the Company's share structure.



YOU On Demand Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: YOD) ("YOU On Demand" or "YOD" or the "Company"), a premium content Video On Demand service provider in China, evolving into a global, mobile-driven, consumer management platform for both enterprises and consumers, announced today that it is changing its corporate name to WeCast Network, Inc ("WeCast Network") to reflect its new direction, forward-looking strategy and near-term product and service roadmap.


The name change will be phased in across all aspects of the business in the relatively near future, except for the legacy video-on-demand business, which will continue to be marketed with the original and current YOU On Demand name and logo and continue to represent the best in video entertainment for the Chinese market.


The YOU On Demand, Inc. corporate name will continue to be used in press releases and corporate filings until the name, WeCast Network, Inc., is officially deemed effective by the SEC.


Chairman Bruno Wu stated, "The impetus surrounding the change of our corporate name to WeCast Network, was to find a designation that could better encompass and further establish our unique identity in the industry and to more accurately represent our planned full portfolio of solutions and services that are in development and aimed at both a Chinese andglobal audience. This name change marks a new and expanded focus, and it underscores our firm commitment to offering innovative products and solutions that go well beyond our current offering. We are investing heavily in the future of our Company, as our industry requires an innovative approach and a fundamentally different way of operating. Our transformation strategy is focused on understanding and capturing data on our consumer's desires and habits and leveraging our business partner's technology and marketing to better monetize our world-class content in order to deliver personalized experiences to our contracted and addressable users and drive value for all of our stakeholders. Our rebranding to WeCast Network represents the ecosystem we are trying to build, coupled with our intention to leverage the infrastructure and reach of some of our partners in order to execute on our strategy."


Founder & Vice Chairman Shane McMahon, commenting on the rebranding, said "Changing our name to WeCast Network formalizes a shift in corporate strategy that has been underway since the beginning of 2016. This new name will be a jumping off point for a more comprehensive and wider-reaching vision, one which has been developing and has come very far in a short amount of time."


Earlier this year, the Company announced a plan to transform its business into 4 distinct verticals: Pay Content, Multi-Channel Network (MCN), Video Commerce and Marketing & Data Management. Since then, the Company has made important progress with each, including but not limited to:



Pay Content Division


Forming the GoLive TV Strategic Partnership expanding the Company's distribution footprint globally via Smart TVs:Press Release Link;


Expanding strategic partnership with Huawei, increasing distribution reach to 10 Million Addressable Users:Press Release Link;


Multi-Channel Network (MCN) Division


Making a strategic investment in Frequency Networks for a 9% stake and forming a partnership for Asian region expansion:Press Release Link;


Forming joint venture with Megtron Hong Kong Investment Group (a leading Asian mobile terminal ODM or original design manufacturer) for Indian and South Eastern Asian market expansion:Press Release Link


Video Commerce Division


Partnering with B.P.O. Global to launch an E- and Video Commerce vertical:Press Release Link;


Marketing & Data Management Division


Additional information/press releases coming at a future date



Alongside the corporate name change, the Company is launching the WeCast Supply Chain Management Platform ("WSCM") that will reside under the Video Commerce Division. WSCM will be an innovative platform that will directlyconnect Chinese product manufacturers to a global market of big box retailers (via various technology platforms), thereby disrupting the existing hierarchical and multilayered model of distribution. M.Y. Products, LLC, or MYP, will be a cornerstone of WSCM.


MYP is 100% owned by Sun Video Group HK Limited or SVG, an affiliate of YOD's Chairman, Bruno Wu, and Sun Seven Stars ("SSS"). Through a signed Term Sheet with SVG, the Company is purchasing 100% of M.Y. Products Global Limited, which owns 51% of M.Y. Products LLC, for $50 million worth of YOD common stock and $800K cash.


Through this transaction, YOU On Demand is gaining both a M2B or Manufacturer to Business, supply chain management operator as well as a M2C or Manufacturer to Consumer, video commerce operator, both of which will offer a full suite of pre-and post-sale services including administration, product management, logistics, financing, branding, licensing support and marketing for Chinese manufacturers exporting to the U.S. MYP assists Chinese manufacturer's revenue and profitability by reducing exorbitant middlemen costs that exist today in the distribution chain and allowing some of those savings to be reapportioned to brand development and design.


SVG guarantees that MYP will achieve $200 million in cumulative revenues and gain profitability, within 12 months of closing the transaction. If MYP fails to meet the guarantee, then SVG shall forfeit back to the Company the YOD common stock it received, on a pro-rata basis. The shares will be held in escrow until the guarantee is met.


This deal with MYP is contingent upon, among other things, both a fairness opinion and third-party valuation.


In addition, each party's obligations to consummate the transaction will be conditioned upon, amongst other things: 1. The completion of due diligence satisfactory to each party; 2. Each party receiving all required approvals (board, shareholder, regulatory, etc.); 3. Executions of a formal agreement containing such provisions as are customary for transactions of this nature.
