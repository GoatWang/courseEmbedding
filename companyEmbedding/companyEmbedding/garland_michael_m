EVEN HEAT DISTRIBUTION
One 27,000 BTU burner per 12" of width, and a 1" thick griddle plate deliver even heat distribution and years of trouble free service.
FLEXIBILITY
Available for natural or propane gas, and perfect in a line-up or as a full-power, stand-alone griddle

SAFE, EASY IGNITION
Griddles are all standard with piezo spark ignition. Thermostat control models have one gas shut off valve per thermostat which gives the ability to leave at desired temperature from day to day without adjustment.
