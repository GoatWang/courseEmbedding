Vision
About Us








Making nature accessible and affordable for a growing society

It is estimated that the world’s population will increase by more than 35% by 2050, reaching 9 billion people. Crop production will need to more than double in order to feed these people and meet the consumer needs of a developing world.  With very little land remaining for agricultural expansion, we as a society need to find ways to maximize the use of our world’s resources.
Plants produce a variety of rare natural products which are used in our daily lives as flavors, fragrances, food ingredients, cosmetics, vitamins, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. We strive to reduce our dependence on land- and resource-intensive practices by recreating natural processes through biotechnology.
SUSTAINABILITY. We provide a renewable and stable supply of natural plant ingredients through fermentation, which frees up agricultural land for food production.
ACCESS. We reduce costs by more than 10-fold, allowing easier adoption and access to these natural ingredients across the world.
DIVERSITY. Replicating plant natural processes in bacteria allows us to benefit from nature’s enormous diversity without threatening natural ecosystems and existing biodiversity. In essence, we tap into nature without harming nature.

Using gut bacteria to save the planet


Ajikumar Parayil grew up in the ‘spice’ region of Kerala in India. To this day, he remembers long hours spent transfusing latex from the trunks of rubber trees on the plantations near his home. The latex is used in multiple products, but to grow it naturally takes time and uses up enormous agricultural resources.
										
										Agricultural resources he now believes could be better spent growing food for the world’s poor and hungry...

Converting E. coli into a pharmaceutical factory


Taxol is the most well-known anti-cancer drug, and has proven remarkably effective against a variety of cancers since the 1970s. It's a natural substance, derived from the bark of yew trees, and as such, its molecular structure is remarkably complex and accounts for its mechanism of action: In 1977, a study revealed that Taxol can bind to the microtubule assembly of a cell, stabilizing the microtubules, which prevents shrinkage and prevents the segregation of chromosomes that accompanies slow cell division.
										
										Because it was derived from natural sources and was difficult to synthesize, supplies of Taxol were initially constrained...
