A small Dallas hedge fund firm is suing three Chicago-based
trading companies, including hedge fund giant Citadel, for losses
sustained during the "flash crash" on May 6.GovPlus Master Fund LP and GovPlus Fund AI LP, which are managed
by Dallas-based financial firm NorCap, say the Chicago funds should
give back $3.15 million that the GovPlus funds paid for put
options. The trades occurred as financial markets were going
haywire, with many prices plunging and then recovering in a brief
period of afternoon trading.The prices the GovPlus funds paid were probably based on "some
form of computer glitch" that led to erroneous prices, the lawsuit
said. The suit was filed this week in state court in Illinois
against Citadel, Wolverine Trading LLC and Chicago Trading Co."Under Illinois law, where a plaintiff has conferred a benefit
upon a defendant, and the defendant's retention of that benefit
would violate equity and good conscience, the defendant must return
the benefit," the lawsuit said, accusing the defendants of "unjust
enrichment."Representatives of Citadel and Wolverine said their firms had no
comment on the lawsuit. A representative of CTC could not be
reached.Before markets opened on May 6, the GovPlus funds had sold some
Standard & Poor's 500 index put options on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange. When markets plummeted the afternoon of May 6,
the funds were on the hook for potentially huge losses.To limit their losses and comply with their risk management
guidelines, they bought put options on the S&P 500 from
Citadel, Wolverine and CTC. But the price of the options spiked
during the crash from about 90 cents per contract to $30 per
contract, a 3,233 percent increase, the lawsuit said.Subsequently, U.S. exchanges canceled more than 20,000 trades in
more than 300 equities and equity derivatives, in which prices
changed by more than 60 percent during the flash crash, the lawsuit
said. The Chicago Board Options Exchange only broke about 138
trades, it said.Earlier this year, the CBOE sent the GovPlus funds a letter
saying the trades would not be nullified or adjusted, according to
the lawsuit. The CBOE official who wrote the letter could not be
reached for comment. According to a September report by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the flash crash was sparked by a large
automated sell order by an institutional investor. That ended up
leading to waves of selling."During the flash crash, U.S. equities markets failed
investors," the lawsuit said. "They gave the appearance that a
historic fire was burning somewhere in the world causing the
intrinsic value of U.S. bellwether equities to plummet. In reality,
there was no fire anywhere, only a false alarm propagated without
contemporaneous explanation across markets in minutes."
