Built for Flexibility
FSC Securities combines strength, service and support to help ensure that advisors are well-positioned to meet the needs of their clients while building long-term, sustainable practices. And we do it your way.






True Independence | Significant Strengths | Personalized Service | Transition Support




True Independence
When you find a broker-dealer possessing a singular commitment to supporting and empowering your way of doing business, then you’ve found true independence. And that’s exactly what more than 1,500 financial advisors have discovered at FSC.
Helping You Thrive
We cultivate the spirit of independence through expert service, resources, and advanced tools that are designed to maximize profitability and exceed client expectations. We put ourselves in your shoes daily in order to develop the systems and resources that you require to make your practice thrive. And we take that a step further—we listen to what you have to say and make adjustments accordingly.
At FSC, we share your entrepreneurial spirit and embrace it from our senior management to a home-office team dedicated to seeing each advisor flourish. It’s why advisors love our highly flexible, ultra-liberating open-architecture approach that enables them to run their practices the way they see fit. We don’t pretend to know your business as well as you do—we just intend to come alongside and strengthen what you are already doing.
Taking the Long View
Many of the advisors we serve have partnered with us for decades, including third-generation members. We believe there’s a reason for that. It’s because we’re able to offer the resources of one of the largest networks of independent advisors, yet still maintain a small-firm, family feel. That’s not a platitude, it’s fact. We deliver strength, resources, and technology in the areas where you need power and then we complement that with a culture and principles that are real and just make common sense. We like to think it’s the best of both worlds.
If being a financial advisor is your career and not just a job, we invite you to consider FSC Securities. We’re here for the long haul and we have the means to back that up.



Advisor Group means QUALITY. And this is exactly what quality means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Significant Strengths
FSC, a member of the Advisor Group family, is truly advisor-centric. We have invested millions of dollars to develop the systems, technologies, support staff, compensation packages, and top-level leadership to help you excel. Beyond our outstanding service and extensive product list, we also offer additional benefits designed to make FSC Securities the ideal solution for your business. These include:
Business Growth Being independent never means being alone. From the minute you join our team, you have dedicated support from our Business Development Team that will introduce you to a vast range of tools designed to ramp up your practice.
Compensation & Recognition Our competitive payout structure is more than a marketing phrase. We sit down with you—without any obligation—and take a hard look at the numbers to see if a move to FSC is the right one for your situation.
Technology Solutions Our pro-business approach to technology has resulted in leading-edge, robust, adaptable, and flexible solutions that streamline account management activities to help get you where you need to be quickly and efficiently.
Marketing & Advertising We provide you with a broad range of marketing materials that are preapproved and proven to be effective, including customizable collateral and high-quality third-party newsletters.
Social Media Support We provide the tools you need to take advantage of Social Media to market yourself and your services. We also have resources dedicated to helping you create a Social Media strategy and better use these tools to build your business.
Fee-Based Services FSC’s next-generation advisory solution, the VISION2020 Wealth Management Platform, delivers integrated research, investment products, and the business tools you need to build and manage a fee-based business.
Case-Specific Consultation One of our unique features is case-specific consultation that ensures you can deliver optimal investment strategies for your most demanding clients. We bring together analysts and attorneys to partner with you and meet any challenge.
Education & Training FSC offers more than one thousand education and training opportunities every year. That’s testament to our commitment to help our advisors be on the front-edge of the financial services industry. On- and off-site classrooms give advisors the flexibility they need to take advantage of these offerings.
Compliance Partnership Helping you meet the industry’s complex and ever-evolving compliance requirements is a priority with FSC. We partner with you in managing risk and offer both online and in-person support.



Advisor Group means SUPPORT. And this is exactly what support means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Personalized Service
FSC takes its responsibility and commitment to advisors quite seriously. We leave no doubt about the support and services you’ll receive from us. To that end, in addition to competitive payouts, our broker-dealers offer a full range of support and solutions.
Because your workday doesn’t necessarily end when the sun goes down, we offer extended hours offering live and experienced telephone advisor services. You can operate with the confidence that we will respond quickly and appropriately to your needs. When we don’t have the answers at our fingertips, we will immediately mobilize as a team to find what you are looking for.
Resources Designed for Today
We don’t want to speak in generalities about our service and support, so let’s spell them out here. Among other more specific resources, you can expect:

A liberating open architecture approach that maximizes your flexibility and supports the way you want to do business
Training for your entire team on our advanced technology solutions that simplify the “business side” and strengthen the “client side”
A commitment to “paperless offices” that streamline work flow
Specialized business conferences to advance your knowledge and create supportive networks among advisors
Customizable, client-approved advertising and marketing materials
Coaching programs designed for immediate impact that give you the tools you need to significantly grow your business
Case-specific consultation to locate and present optimal investments for any client and any situation
An Online Registration Center to help on-board new advisors to your office easily and efficiently
Leveraged buying power on software and services with pre-arranged discounts
A focus on “your voice” through advisor-led committees that offer early input on important issues
ConnectED: perhaps the industry’s most impressive national educational conference, held annually with an invitation to all of our affiliated advisors




Advisor Group means POWER. And this is exactly what power means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Transition Support
When you’ve reviewed all of the facts and made the decision to join FSC, we will do everything possible to ensure a seamless transition. Throughout the years, we’ve helped thousands of advisors like you successfully make this all-important change and, although it requires careful attention, it is easily accomplished.
To begin with, you’ll have the services of a team of transition professionals, including a dedicated transition liaison. These experts will work closely with you to thoroughly plan your transition process according to your unique requirements and needs and then will guide you through it every step of the way.
Four Easy Steps
Through our exclusive approach to onboarding, the experience is neither daunting nor time-consuming. In just four steps, you can easily transition your practice to FSC. In short, the process is as easy as this:
Step 1: Talk After some introductory conversations, we will start gathering information to make for a smooth transition. Our team will get to know your business and, through our online pre-registration forms, will determine how best to supervise and transition your business.
Step 2: Track Together we will create a customized game plan for your transition, give you a link for forms and registration, and provide you with dedicated assistance.
Step 3: Transition Our transition team will help move your book of business while providing training on key website tools and systems. Based on your GDC level, a liaison will also simultaneously submit your advertising pieces for initial review and input.
Step 4: Takeoff! In the final stage, our transition team reviews any outstanding issues and accounts not yet transferred. You will then be introduced to our service group that will be available for ongoing support and assistance.
Individual Office Support
FSC has even simplified the process for OSJ pre-hire review and affiliation by allowing you to complete the majority of your paperwork online, saving you time, and sparing you frustration. Through our Online Registration Center, incoming advisors create a personalized profile and complete the necessary forms on their own schedule because it’s designed to save progress and return at any time. Instant feedback is available throughout the process to ensure that you have our full support.



Advisor Group means STRENGTH. And this is exactly what strength means to us.

Built for Flexibility
FSC Securities combines strength, service and support to help ensure that advisors are well-positioned to meet the needs of their clients while building long-term, sustainable practices. And we do it your way.






True Independence | Significant Strengths | Personalized Service | Transition Support




True Independence
When you find a broker-dealer possessing a singular commitment to supporting and empowering your way of doing business, then you’ve found true independence. And that’s exactly what more than 1,500 financial advisors have discovered at FSC.
Helping You Thrive
We cultivate the spirit of independence through expert service, resources, and advanced tools that are designed to maximize profitability and exceed client expectations. We put ourselves in your shoes daily in order to develop the systems and resources that you require to make your practice thrive. And we take that a step further—we listen to what you have to say and make adjustments accordingly.
At FSC, we share your entrepreneurial spirit and embrace it from our senior management to a home-office team dedicated to seeing each advisor flourish. It’s why advisors love our highly flexible, ultra-liberating open-architecture approach that enables them to run their practices the way they see fit. We don’t pretend to know your business as well as you do—we just intend to come alongside and strengthen what you are already doing.
Taking the Long View
Many of the advisors we serve have partnered with us for decades, including third-generation members. We believe there’s a reason for that. It’s because we’re able to offer the resources of one of the largest networks of independent advisors, yet still maintain a small-firm, family feel. That’s not a platitude, it’s fact. We deliver strength, resources, and technology in the areas where you need power and then we complement that with a culture and principles that are real and just make common sense. We like to think it’s the best of both worlds.
If being a financial advisor is your career and not just a job, we invite you to consider FSC Securities. We’re here for the long haul and we have the means to back that up.



Advisor Group means QUALITY. And this is exactly what quality means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Significant Strengths
FSC, a member of the Advisor Group family, is truly advisor-centric. We have invested millions of dollars to develop the systems, technologies, support staff, compensation packages, and top-level leadership to help you excel. Beyond our outstanding service and extensive product list, we also offer additional benefits designed to make FSC Securities the ideal solution for your business. These include:
Business Growth Being independent never means being alone. From the minute you join our team, you have dedicated support from our Business Development Team that will introduce you to a vast range of tools designed to ramp up your practice.
Compensation & Recognition Our competitive payout structure is more than a marketing phrase. We sit down with you—without any obligation—and take a hard look at the numbers to see if a move to FSC is the right one for your situation.
Technology Solutions Our pro-business approach to technology has resulted in leading-edge, robust, adaptable, and flexible solutions that streamline account management activities to help get you where you need to be quickly and efficiently.
Marketing & Advertising We provide you with a broad range of marketing materials that are preapproved and proven to be effective, including customizable collateral and high-quality third-party newsletters.
Social Media Support We provide the tools you need to take advantage of Social Media to market yourself and your services. We also have resources dedicated to helping you create a Social Media strategy and better use these tools to build your business.
Fee-Based Services FSC’s next-generation advisory solution, the VISION2020 Wealth Management Platform, delivers integrated research, investment products, and the business tools you need to build and manage a fee-based business.
Case-Specific Consultation One of our unique features is case-specific consultation that ensures you can deliver optimal investment strategies for your most demanding clients. We bring together analysts and attorneys to partner with you and meet any challenge.
Education & Training FSC offers more than one thousand education and training opportunities every year. That’s testament to our commitment to help our advisors be on the front-edge of the financial services industry. On- and off-site classrooms give advisors the flexibility they need to take advantage of these offerings.
Compliance Partnership Helping you meet the industry’s complex and ever-evolving compliance requirements is a priority with FSC. We partner with you in managing risk and offer both online and in-person support.



Advisor Group means SUPPORT. And this is exactly what support means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Personalized Service
FSC takes its responsibility and commitment to advisors quite seriously. We leave no doubt about the support and services you’ll receive from us. To that end, in addition to competitive payouts, our broker-dealers offer a full range of support and solutions.
Because your workday doesn’t necessarily end when the sun goes down, we offer extended hours offering live and experienced telephone advisor services. You can operate with the confidence that we will respond quickly and appropriately to your needs. When we don’t have the answers at our fingertips, we will immediately mobilize as a team to find what you are looking for.
Resources Designed for Today
We don’t want to speak in generalities about our service and support, so let’s spell them out here. Among other more specific resources, you can expect:

A liberating open architecture approach that maximizes your flexibility and supports the way you want to do business
Training for your entire team on our advanced technology solutions that simplify the “business side” and strengthen the “client side”
A commitment to “paperless offices” that streamline work flow
Specialized business conferences to advance your knowledge and create supportive networks among advisors
Customizable, client-approved advertising and marketing materials
Coaching programs designed for immediate impact that give you the tools you need to significantly grow your business
Case-specific consultation to locate and present optimal investments for any client and any situation
An Online Registration Center to help on-board new advisors to your office easily and efficiently
Leveraged buying power on software and services with pre-arranged discounts
A focus on “your voice” through advisor-led committees that offer early input on important issues
ConnectED: perhaps the industry’s most impressive national educational conference, held annually with an invitation to all of our affiliated advisors




Advisor Group means POWER. And this is exactly what power means to us.

Transition Support
When you’ve reviewed all of the facts and made the decision to join FSC, we will do everything possible to ensure a seamless transition. Throughout the years, we’ve helped thousands of advisors like you successfully make this all-important change and, although it requires careful attention, it is easily accomplished.
To begin with, you’ll have the services of a team of transition professionals, including a dedicated transition liaison. These experts will work closely with you to thoroughly plan your transition process according to your unique requirements and needs and then will guide you through it every step of the way.
Four Easy Steps
Through our exclusive approach to onboarding, the experience is neither daunting nor time-consuming. In just four steps, you can easily transition your practice to FSC. In short, the process is as easy as this:
Step 1: Talk After some introductory conversations, we will start gathering information to make for a smooth transition. Our team will get to know your business and, through our online pre-registration forms, will determine how best to supervise and transition your business.
Step 2: Track Together we will create a customized game plan for your transition, give you a link for forms and registration, and provide you with dedicated assistance.
Step 3: Transition Our transition team will help move your book of business while providing training on key website tools and systems. Based on your GDC level, a liaison will also simultaneously submit your advertising pieces for initial review and input.
Step 4: Takeoff! In the final stage, our transition team reviews any outstanding issues and accounts not yet transferred. You will then be introduced to our service group that will be available for ongoing support and assistance.
Individual Office Support
FSC has even simplified the process for OSJ pre-hire review and affiliation by allowing you to complete the majority of your paperwork online, saving you time, and sparing you frustration. Through our Online Registration Center, incoming advisors create a personalized profile and complete the necessary forms on their own schedule because it’s designed to save progress and return at any time. Instant feedback is available throughout the process to ensure that you have our full support.



Advisor Group means STRENGTH. And this is exactly what strength means to us.

First-Class Support
FSC has made an art of listening to advisors in order to deliver the first-class support that top producers require. Our teams come alongside you to help ensure that you can deliver the service your clients expect.






Personal Attention | Open Architecture | Sales Support | Pro-Business Compliance




Personal Attention
We are confident that the advisors we serve enjoy the best of both worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. As a member of Advisor Group, one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry, we have the tools you need to excel in today’s business environment. Importantly, we also deliver hands-on, customized service.
And it starts at the top. Every member of our senior management team has decades of experience in the industry and promotes an open door policy. When you need to talk to anyone about any issue, you have the complete assurance you will be heard.
We Listen and Respond
But we go further than that. We also have a number of advisory boards that keep us well connected to our advisors. Some of our most significant advances each year come from listening carefully to them and taking the appropriate action as a result. Our advisors help direct our path.
At the end of the day, we put advisors first in all of our thinking and planning. If you’ve ever felt abandoned or ignored by your home office, be prepared for a new and refreshing collaborative experience with FSC.



Advisors in Their Own Voice: Randy Cox, FSC Securities
Ready to Talk?



Open Architecture
For years, broker-dealers have been forcing their advisors into their mold. Making them change their own proven approaches and systems to conform to corporate structures that were set years ago, but possibly no longer effective. We know that what works for one advisor might not be a good fit for another. It’s the reason our advisors appreciate our steadfast commitment to an open architecture platform. And it informs every decision we make.
The bottom line is that we believe you know the best way to manage and grow your business. Because of that belief, we embrace your vision and want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, FSC is focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place.
Flexibility & Customization
To us, open architecture is more than a philosophy. It’s an everyday reality. One that lets you define your ideal approach to business and then delivers powerful options that make it happen. Our open architecture encourages you to:

Set up and manage your practice in the way that works best for you
Work with the systems you prefer and we’ll look to integrate them into ours
Market yourself to your customers and prospects in the way you know has historically produced results
Offer more products from more sponsor firms and choose from two custody/clearing options
Define a customized succession plan that makes sense today and delivers real benefits for the future





We believe you know the best way to manage and grow your business. Because of that, we embrace your vision and want you to do business your way.

Sales Support
Our Internal Sales Desk, together with our Advanced Sales/Qualified Plans, Investment Advisory Services, Insurance Consulting Services and Retirement Plan Consulting Services teams, provide advisors with comprehensive and consultative sales support across all product lines. Our goal is to offer solution-driven support across the spectrum and throughout all phases of the client engagement process.
The collaborative nature of our sales support teams is central to our ability to effectively support our advisors by identifying opportunities that add true value every time we have a conversation with an advisor. Our sales and education efforts across all product lines are designed to help our advisors, in whatever way possible, deliver quality investment strategies and advice to their clients.
Retirement Plan Consulting Team
Our Retirement Plan Consulting Services Team (RPSC) can help you capture your share of the trillions of dollars that are currently in play in the retirement plans marketplace. Part of Advisor Group’s dynamic sales organization, RPCS provides the focused support and concrete tools designed to help you thrive in the retirement plan marketplace.
Don’t go it alone trying to navigate the retirement planning landscape. RPCS delivers guidance that’s not one-size-fits-all and it is just a phone call away. Our advisors also have complete access to our Advanced Planning and Plan Design Support teams.
From regulations to legislation, our experts assess the impact on your practice and deliver easy-to-interpret updates via our Advanced Sales Desk—helping you capitalize on information so you can deliver value to your clients.
Benchmarking Tools
There’s a lot of competition out there in the retirement plan marketplace, so differentiation is critical. Deploying our state-of-the-art fee benchmarking programs, RFP comparisons, investment analytics, and compliance tools will give you the edge you need to break away from the pack.
Advanced Sales
Our firm is unique in the independent broker-dealer space in that we have in-house attorneys available to provide subject matter expertise and assist you with case design strategies and complex business issues. Although the attorneys don’t provide tax advice, they do understand and capitalize on the tax attributes of the products you offer by providing tax information designed to help your clients make informed decisions.
Each of our Advanced Sales attorneys bring decades of industry experience to the table and their advice is objective, independent and neutral regarding providers. Their areas of expertise include estate planning, charitable giving, business insurance and non-qualified benefit planning. They also offer expert-level knowledge on everything from IRAs to ESOPs and often challenging subjects such as long-term care, Medicaid and combination products, as well as alternative investments.



Our collaborative nature is central to our ability to effectively support our advisors by identifying opportunities that add true value in every area of their practices.

Pro-Business Compliance
Compliance is a priority at FSC and we provide the expert consultation, support and tools you need, designed to help avoid regulatory issues, reduce complaints and manage risk. Our commitment extends beyond the routine supervisory duties and branch exams to include a full suite of resources that enable you to move much of your compliance burden to us.
The bottom line is that we are pro-business with the full intention of helping your practice succeed. It’s not about introducing obstacles, it is all about creating opportunities.
Advertising Review
Personalized advertising consultation that provides access to an advertising analyst is also available just by picking up the phone. Your analyst will guide you through the steps to help ensure that all marketing initiatives meet FINRA guidelines. We also deliver our advisors an online sales practice manual for 24/7 access to current information on compliance issues. This valuable resource is backed by a dedicated phone support staff available during regular business hours.
Also, to assist you in transitioning to a fully paperless office, we supply guidance that can support and enhance your efforts to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy in record keeping when implementing an electronic storage solution.
And to keep you up-to-date, the latest developments are covered in-person at our annual compliance meeting. We also enable you to meet your annual requirements online so that you can determine what best fits your schedule.



The bottom-line is that we operate with the full intention of helping you succeed. It’s not about introducing obstacles, it is all about creating opportunities.

THE FSC SECURITIES PERSPECTIVE

Story

Our
Stability







A Commitment to Supporting and Empowering Independence
Since our first days as a company in 1958, we have been unconditionally committed as a firm to strengthening and supporting the advisors we serve. In fact, to ensure that you have the power you need and the right tools to get the job done we do something radical in this industry: we listen to you. Your input helps shape what we do and how we do it. And then if what we do can be improved, we won’t stop until exactly what’s needed is done. It’s a commitment.
The results reflect this approach. More than 1,200 advisors call FSC home and they boast an average annual GDC in excess of $261,000 with a total of $38 billion in total client assets. With an impressive retention rate and an average tenure of 10.6 years, we find that when advisors find us, they stay and tend to stay for a long time. For nearly 60 years, FSC has been the first choice for advisors.
drill down deeper


When an advisor selects to affiliate with FSC, they tend to stay for a very long time—on average for well over a decade and often to the end of their career.

Top producers—and our advisors average over $261,000 in annual GDC—like what they’ve found at FSC because of the culture of collaboration and support.



Flexibility, Tools and Options That Put Advisors in Control
FSC puts advisors in control by providing them with flexibility to run their business the way they want. We want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, we are focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place. The bottom line is that you know the best way to manage your own business.
Your ability to excel in your practice is tied to having the right tools to get the job done. That’s why FSC is dedicated to developing sophisticated programs, technologies and guardrails necessary for success. These include a suite of solutions for business planning, streamlined offices, portfolio management, and a wide range of powerful resources integrated into one dynamic resource center.

Our liberating “open architecture” approach is designed to maximize your flexibility and support so that it fits the way you want to do business.

Choose from a wide range of affiliation options and we’ll help ensure that you are in your comfort zone: Independent, Branch or RIA models.



We Put Advisors First and Then Provide Extraordinary Support
We are confident that the financial professionals we serve enjoy the best of all worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. That’s because we are part of one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry and yet have maintained a family feel with a genuine open-door policy that encourages advisor input and helps shape the firm’s direction. In every way, FSC is advisor-centric.
We never take our commitment to supporting advisors lightly. As an FSC advisor you can count on advanced technology, business-building support, learning opportunities, coaching and training, and extensive product listings. Our support begins at the moment you choose to join our team and continues throughout your career with us and even beyond. Now the industry standards, our succession and continuity programs help you reap the rewards of a job well done.

This exceptional event, held annually, is a focused, strategic meeting designed for advisors who are serious about furthering their practice.
Focus Forums
Throughout the year, full-day meetings are scheduled at various locations around the country and are comprised of talented speakers from our outstanding array of strategic partners.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
