Mr. McBride has over two decades of experience in financial roles in the 
      communications industry, including more than a decade at Frontier 
      earlier in his career, and was most recently CFO at Cable & Wireless 
      Communications Plc.


                                        








Dan McCarthy, Frontier’s President and CEO, said, “We are very pleased 
      to welcome Perley back to Frontier. Perley is a highly respected finance 
      leader in the communications industry and has unique insight into our 
      business as a result of his prior roles here. He has a successful track 
      record of allocating capital to drive shareholder value, increasing 
      efficiency, improving margins, and executing on strategic plans. Perley 
      will play an integral part in attaining the financial targets we have 
      set for Frontier, including achieving Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the 
      range of $825 million to $900 million in 2016, Adjusted EBITDA in excess 
      of $4 billion in 2017, as well as our expense synergy target of at least 
      $1.25 billion.”


                                        








Mr. McBride said, “I am very excited to be rejoining Frontier at such a 
      pivotal time in the Company’s history. Frontier has tremendous future 
      opportunities and I look forward to being a part of Dan’s team as we 
      seek to grow the business and achieve the substantial synergies and 
      efficiencies made possible by Frontier’s substantially-increased scale.”


                                        








Mr. McCarthy added, “I would like to thank John Jureller for his many 
      contributions during his four years with Frontier, a period that 
      included two major acquisitions that more than doubled our size. I am 
      pleased that John will stay on to ensure a seamless handoff, and we wish 
      him well in his future endeavors.”

Prior to joining Frontier, Perley McBride was the Chief Financial 
      Officer of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc until its May 2016 
      acquisition by Liberty Global plc. Previously, Mr. McBride served as 
      Chief Financial Officer at Leap Wireless International, which operated 
      the Cricket Communications mobile brand, from December 2012 through May 
      2014 and was part of the Executive team that led the business through 
      its acquisition by AT&T Inc. Prior to Leap Wireless, he served as 
      Executive Vice President of Finance at The Weather Company, owner of The 
      Weather Channel among other assets, between 2010 and 2012, where he was 
      instrumental in achieving sustained EBITDA growth and reducing leverage 
      by two turns. He served in several senior financial management roles at 
      Frontier between 1999 and 2010, and also between 1994 and 1997. During 
      that period, he created a culture of expense discipline that enabled 
      Frontier to achieve a consistent track record of sustaining 
      industry-leading margins. He also worked in the finance department at 
      Sprint Corporation early in his career. He holds a Bachelor of Science 
      degree from Mount Allison University in Canada and has an MBA from the

Forward-Looking Statements









This document contains "forward-looking statements," related to future, 
      not past, events. Forward-looking statements address our expected future 
      business and financial performance and financial condition, and contain 
      words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," 
      "seek," "see," "will," "would," or "target." Forward-looking statements 
      by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, 
      uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual 
      results to be materially different than those expressed in our 
      forward-looking statements include: risks related to the acquisition of 
      properties from Verizon, including our ability to successfully operate 
      the acquired business, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, 
      our ability to enter into or obtain, or delays in entering into or 
      obtaining, agreements and consents necessary to operate the acquired 
      business as planned, on terms acceptable to us, and increased expenses 
      incurred due to activities related to the transaction; our ability to 
      meet our debt and debt service obligations; competition from cable, 
      wireless and wireline carriers and satellite companies and the risk that 
      we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; our ability to 
      successfully adjust to changes in the communications industry, including 
      the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital 
      expenditures, products and service offerings; reductions in revenue from 
      our voice customers that we cannot offset with increases in revenue from 
      broadband and video subscribers and sales of other products and 
      services; our ability to maintain relationships with customers, 
      employees or suppliers; the impact of regulation and regulatory, 
      investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks; 
      continued reductions in switched access revenues as a result of 
      regulation, competition or technology substitutions; the effects of 
      changes in the availability of federal and state universal service 
      funding or other subsidies to us and our competitors; our ability to 
      effectively manage service quality in our territories and meet mandated 
      service quality metrics; our ability to successfully introduce new 
      product offerings; the effects of changes in accounting policies or 
      practices, including potential future impairment charges with respect to 
      our intangible assets; our ability to effectively manage our operations, 
      operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and 
      cash paid for income taxes and liquidity, which may affect payment of 
      dividends on our common and preferred shares; the effects of changes in 
      both general and local economic conditions on the markets that we serve; 
      the effects of increased medical expenses and pension and postemployment 
      expenses; the effects of changes in income tax rates, tax laws, 
      regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments; our ability 
      to successfully renegotiate union contracts; changes in pension plan 
      assumptions, interest rates, regulatory rules and/or the value of our 
      pension plan assets, which could require us to make increased 
      contributions to the pension plan in 2016 and beyond; adverse changes in 
      the credit markets or in the ratings given to our debt securities by 
      nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or 
      restrict the ability, or increase the cost, of financing to us; the 
      effects of state regulatory cash management practices that could limit 
      our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries or dividend funds up 
      to the parent company; the effects of severe weather events or other 
      natural or man-made disasters, which may increase our operating expenses 
      or adversely impact customer revenue; the impact of potential 
      information technology or data security breaches or other disruptions; 
      and the other factors that are described in our filings with the U.S. 
      Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K 
      and 10-Q. These risks and uncertainties may cause our actual future 
      results to be materially different than those expressed in our 
      forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise 
      these forward-looking statements.

R. Perley McBride (Photo: Business Wire) 


 Mr. McBride has over two decades of experience in financial roles in the 
 communications industry, including more than a decade at Frontier 
 earlier in his career, and was most recently CFO at Cable & Wireless (News - Alert) 
 Communications Plc.
 

 Dan McCarthy, Frontier's President and CEO, said, "We are very pleased 
 to welcome Perley back to Frontier. Perley is a highly respected finance 
 leader in the communications industry and has unique insight into our 
 business as a result of his prior roles here. He has a successful track 
 record of allocating capital to drive shareholder value, increasing 
 efficiency, improving margins, and executing on strategic plans. Perley 
 will play an integral part in attaining the financial targets we have 
 set for Frontier, including achieving Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the 
 range of $825 million to $900 million in 2016, Adjusted EBITDA in excess 
 of $4 billion in 2017, as well as our expense synergy target of at least 
 $1.25 billion."
 

 Mr. McBride said, "I am very excited to be rejoining Frontier at such a 
 pivotal time in the Company's history. Frontier has tremendous future 
 opportunities and I look forward to being a part of Dan's team as we 
 seek to grow the business and achieve the substantial synergies and 
 efficiencies made possible by Frontier's substantially-increased scale."
 

 Mr. McCarthy added, "I would like to thank John Jureller for his many 
 contributions during his four years with Frontier, a period that 
 included two major acquisitions that more than doubled our size. I am 
 pleased that John will stay on to ensure a seamless handoff, and we wish 
 him well in his future endeavors."
 

R. Perley McBride Biography


 Prior to joining Frontier, Perley McBride was the Chief Financial 
 Officer of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc until its May 2016 
 acquisition by Liberty Global plc. Previously, Mr. McBride served as 
 Chief Financial Officer at Leap Wireless International (News - Alert), which operated 
 the Cricket Communications mobile brand, from December 2012 through May 
 2014 and was part of the Executive team that led the business through 
 its acquisition by AT&T (News - Alert) Inc. Prior to Leap Wireless, he served as 
 Executive Vice Pesident of Finance at The Weather Company, owner of The 
 Weather Channel among other assets, between 2010 and 2012, where he was 
 instrumental in achieving sustained EBITDA growth and reducing leverage 
 by two turns. He served in several senior financial management roles at 
 Frontier between 1999 and 2010, and also between 1994 and 1997. During 
 that period, he created a culture of expense discipline that enabled 
 Frontier to achieve a consistent track record of sustaining 
 industry-leading margins. He also worked in the finance department at 
 Sprint (News - Alert) Corporation early in his career. He holds a Bachelor of Science 
 degree from Mount Allison University in Canada and has an MBA from the

Forward-Looking Statements


 This document contains "forward-looking statements," related to future, 
 not past, events. Forward-looking statements address our expected future 
 business and financial performance and financial condition, and contain 
 words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," 
 "seek," "see," "will," "would," or "target." Forward-looking statements 
 by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, 
 uncertain. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual 
 results to be materially different than those expressed in our 
 forward-looking statements include: risks related to the acquisition of 
 properties from Verizon (News - Alert), including our ability to successfully operate 
 the acquired business, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, 
 our ability to enter into or obtain, or delays in entering into or 
 obtaining, agreements and consents necessary to operate the acquired 
 business as planned, on terms acceptable to us, and increased expenses 
 incurred due to activities related to the transaction; our ability to 
 meet our debt and debt service obligations; competition from cable, 
 wireless and wireline carriers and satellite companies and the risk that 
 we will not respond on a timely or profitable basis; our ability to 
 successfully adjust to changes in the communications industry, including 
 the effects of technological changes and competition on our capital 
 expenditures, products and service offerings; reductions in revenue from 
 our voice customers that we cannot offset with increases in revenue from 
 broadband and video subscribers and sales of other products and 
 services; our ability to maintain relationships with customers, 
 employees or suppliers; the impact of regulation and regulatory, 
 investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks; 
 continued reductions in switched access revenues as a result of 
 regulation, competition or technology substitutions; the effects of 
 changes in the availability of federal and state universal service 
 funding or other subsidies to us and our competitors; our ability to 
 effectively manage service quality in our territories and meet mandated 
 service quality metrics; our ability to successfully introduce new 
 product offerings; the effects of changes in accounting policies or 
 practices, including potential future impairment charges with respect to 
 our intangible assets; our ability to effectively manage our operations, 
 operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and 
 cash paid for income taxes and liquidity, which may affect payment of 
 dividends on our common and preferred shares; the effects of changes in 
 both general and local economic conditions on the markets that we serve; 
 the effects of increased medical expenses and pension and postemployment 
 expenses; the effects of changes in income tax rates, tax laws, 
 regulations or rulings, or federal or state tax assessments; our ability 
 to successfully renegotiate union contracts; changes in pension plan 
 assumptions, interest rates, regulatory rules and/or the value of our 
 pension plan assets, which could require us to make increased 
 contributions to the pension plan in 2016 and beyond; adverse changes in 
 the credit markets or in the ratings given to our debt securities by 
 nationally accredited ratings organizations, which could limit or 
 restrict the ability, or increase the cost, of financing to us; the 
 effects of state regulatory cash management practices that could limit 
 our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries or dividend funds up 
 to the parent company; the effects of severe weather events or other 
 natural or man-made disasters, which may increase our operating expenses 
 or adversely impact customer revenue; the impact of potential 
 information technology or data security breaches or other disruptions; 
 and the other factors that are described in our filings with the U.S. 
 Securities and Exchange Commission, including our reports on Forms 10-K 
 and 10-Q. These risks and uncertainties may cause our actual future 
 results to be materially different than those expressed in our 
 forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise 
 these forward-looking statements.
