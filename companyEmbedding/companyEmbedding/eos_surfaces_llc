But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Norfolk, VA professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Norfolk, VA portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Norfolk, VA professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Norfolk

EOS Solid Surface bridges the gap between seamless solid surface and high-end laminate. Our patent pending 3cm (1 1/4″) material offers all the advantages of premium solid surface, in a thicker, more durable material at a surprisingly low price.
By eliminating up to 75% of the labor required for traditional 1/2″ solid surface, EOS combines the massive look of granite with a lower price point and faster delivery. The end result is a true value in the classic sense: a higher quality product at a competitive price, offering you the flexibility to create the countertop you’ve always wanted.
EOS Solid Surface for Your Home.
EOS makes an ideal kitchen countertop for any homeowner. For those looking for a renewable, non-porous, maintenance-free and seamless countertop, EOS is the perfect fit. With its 1 ¼” thickness, EOS gives a much deeper and substantial feel than the industry standard ½” thick solid surface countertop. With the possibility of an integrated seamless bowl and coved backsplash, an EOS countertop can provide you with an incredibly hygienic, yet sophisticated countertop for your home.
EOS for Commercial Use
The EOS Solid Surface product has had incredible success in the commercial market over the last five years. With its inherent superior strength relative to ½” solid surface and its non-porous nature, EOS is the ideal countertop for any commercial applications.

Sentara Healthcare Opens Copper-Infused Hospital Wing to Improve Patient Care
(Reuters) Norfolk, VA – November 15, 2013 – As patient fears of hospital infections and superbugs continue to rise, one hospital in Norfolk, Va. is taking a unique approach to battling these issues – copper.
Sentara Healthcare will open a new 129-bed patient tower at its Sentara Leigh Hospital site, where the patient rooms and most clinical spaces have been outfitted with antimicrobial copper-infused surfaces, including countertops, over-the-bed tables and bed rails. In early 2014, Sentara will add antimicrobial copper-infused textiles, ranging from bed linens to patients gowns, throughout the entire East Tower.
The use of the copper-infused surfaces and textiles will be part of an evaluation to determine whether they decrease the development of infections, and thus the need for antibiotics prescribed as a result of hospital-acquired infections. It will be the world’s largest-known study to date of durable, biologically active antimicrobial surfaces, which is expected to begin Q1 2014.
The secret ingredient to these materials is a copper technology developed by Richmond, Va.-based Cupron, a biotechnology company that has found ways to isolate copper so that it can be stabilized and imbedded in a variety of materials to take advantage of its natural antimicrobial properties. Cupron partnered with EOS Surfaces in Norfolk, Va., to develop Antimicrobial Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces, which have been approved by the EPA for their ability to kill greater than 99.9 percent of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria* within two hours of exposure. It is the only copper-infused antimicrobial surface with this EPA-approved public health claim.
“Sentara is pleased to become the first large-scale deployment of these advanced antimicrobial materials,” said Dr. Gene Burke, vice president of Clinical Effectiveness for Sentara. “Over the years, Sentara has implemented many advanced practices in an effort to minimize hospital-acquired infections at our facilities and we believe that new technologies, such as the copper-infused materials, have the potential to create another layer of protection in this very important effort.”
In the United States, hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) account for nearly 1.7 million infections and 100,000 deaths each year. A 2009 CDC study estimates the annual direct costs of HAIs between $35.7 billion and $45 billion.
“After spending two years developing Antimicrobial Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces and most of the past 18 months expanding our manufacturing capabilities, the opening of Sentara’s Leigh East Tower and the launch of the world’s largest study of antimicrobial materials is a pivotal moment for EOS Surfaces,” said Ken Trinder, CEO of EOS Surfaces. “We expect the study to validate what our EPA registration and testing has already affirmed: that Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces can play a significant role in hospitals’ efforts to reduce HAIs.”
“HAIs are a complex problem that will require new technologies and healthcare products working together to continue the journey to zero-infection environments,” said Paul Rocheleau, chairman of Cupron. “But what our Cupron-enhanced materials do is provide hospitals with another layer of protection that is constantly working in the background, to complement their existing infection control practices. We look forward to ‘Cupronizing’ more hospitals in the future like we’ve done with Sentara.”
The use of Antimicrobial Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces is a supplement to and not a substitute for standard infection control practices; users must continue to follow all current infection control practices, including those practices related to cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces. Antimicrobial Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces have been shown to reduce microbial contamination but they do not necessarily prevent cross contamination.
Sentara has received national recognition in recent years for its efforts to improve patient care and reduce infections. National quality leaders such as VHA have blueprinted Sentara practices at reducing, and in some cases, eliminating ventilator-associated pneumonia. In addition, Sentara hospitals have been recognized for work in its ICUs to reduce central line blood stream infections and urinary tract infections.
*Testing demonstrates effective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterobacter aerogenes (ATCC 13048), Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA-ATCC 33592), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 35150) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442).

Large-Scale, Multi-Site Test of Copper-Based Antimicrobial-Protected Materials
RICHMOND, Va. – January 17, 2013 – Sentara Healthcare, Cupron, EOS Surfaces and Encompass Group are joining together to evaluate the clinical and economic effectiveness of deploying antimicrobial copper-based hard surfaces and textiles in a range of healthcare environments.
This comprehensive program is believed to be the world’s largest hospital evaluation to-date of antimicrobial-protected materials, with the goal of combating the spread of pathogens that are known to contribute to healthcare infections. Cupron-Enhanced EOS Surfaces and Cupron-enhanced textiles will be evaluated at multiple sites, including a new 250-bed acute care facility, to assess the improvement of patient outcomes and the reduction of healthcare costs.
This large-scale program will include the installation of more than 15,000 horizontal square feet of patent-pending Cupron-Enhanced EOS Surfaces. The antimicrobial hard surfaces will be installed on virtually all clinical and patient room surfaces. Anti-odor textiles manufactured by the Encompass Group will be used for patient bed linens, patient gowns and other textiles.
The trial will initiate this April at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, followed by a large-scale study that will take place at Sentara Leigh Hospital in Norfolk, Va., where a series of acute care towers are now under construction. The first “Cupron-enhanced” units are slated to open in Q4 2013. The existing acute care tower without any Cupron-enhanced surfaces or textiles will serve as the comparative. Additional studies are planned for various long-term care facilities and outpatient centers.
“Sentara is pleased to become the first large-scale deployment of these advanced antimicrobial materials,” said Dr. Gene Burke, vice president of Clinical Effectiveness for Sentara. “Over the years, Sentara has implemented many advanced practices in an effort to minimize hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) at our facilities and we believe that new technologies, such as the Cupron-enhanced materials, have the potential to create another layer of protection in this very important effort.”
Sentara has received national recognition in recent years for its efforts to improve patient care and reduce infections. National quality leaders such as VHA have blueprinted Sentara practices at reducing, and in some cases, eliminating ventilator-associated pneumonia. In addition, Sentara hospitals have been recognized for work in its ICUs to reduce central line blood stream infections and urinary tract infections.
“We are increasingly realizing that there are processes and technologies that are effective at reducing and possibly eliminating some of these infections once believed to be an inevitable part of the healthcare experience,” Burke added.
“Approximately seven million people worldwide acquire a hospital-acquired infection each year,” said Paul Rocheleau, chairman of Cupron.  “Despite aggressive monitoring, hand washing campaigns and other infection control measures, HAI rates, especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, are unacceptably high worldwide and in the United States. The Sentara program, supported by EOS Surfaces and Encompass Group, will hopefully be one of the first steps to define a new level of patient care.”
In the United States, HAIs account for nearly 1.7 million infections and 100,000 deaths each year.  A 2009 CDC study estimates the annual direct costs of HAIs between $35.7 billion and $45 billion.
“We have worked diligently with Cupron in developing this new product and are excited to test its clinical effectiveness and monitor the hopeful difference it can make in a healthcare environment,” said Ken Trinder, CEO of EOS Surfaces. “The timing of the Sentara program was fortuitous as we have made a major investment in new manufacturing capabilities, and are rapidly building the network of companies that will play important roles in fabricating countertops, lavatories, furniture and other products that utilize the Cupron-enhanced EOS materials.”
A small-scale clinical trial with Cupron-enhanced textiles in Israel resulted in significant positive outcomes for chronically ill patients, adding further evidence of the role textiles may have in supporting pathogen transmission. Also, Cupron-Enhanced EOS Surfaces recently received US EPA Public Health registrations to certify the efficacy, durability and ability to continuously kill a range of pathogens.  Cupron expects to receive additional public health registrations during 2013.
The use of textiles and hard surfaces containing copper may not only significantly contribute to the reduction of hospital infections, but may also help protect other environments where bacterial pathogens may colonize and contribute to infections such as assisted living facilities, offices and public institutions.

EPA Supports Claim that Cupron Enhanced EOS Can Kill 99.9% of Bacteria
RICHMOND, Va. and NORFOLK, Va. — October 24, 2012 —Cupron, creator of a copper-based antimicrobial technology, and EOS Surfaces, a solid surface manufacturer, jointly announce that their surface, Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces, has received the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) approval to make a Public Health Claim that their copper-enhanced material can kill greater than 99.9% of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria* within two hours of exposure. Prior to this, only elemental copper and certain copper alloys held this official distinction.
The approval is based on Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces’ ability to kill specific disease causing bacteria, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli (O157:H7). MRSA is one of the most common strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and a well-recognized cause of health care-acquired infections (HAIs). The two companies expect this material to help health care organizations and infection control specialists manage HAIs. The product is approved for use in a wide range of applications, including health care.
“The EPA’s approval of our public health claims surrounding Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces is a pivotal moment in not only the commercialization of our technology, but also how health care facilities combat hospital infections,” said Paul Rocheleau, chairman of Cupron.  “HAIs have a devastating effect on the health care environment, causing thousands of deaths and costing billions of dollars each year. While we fully acknowledge our surface won’t end this problem, we believe these innovative materials will provide an additional layer of protection in managing the risks associated with microbial control.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates HAIs affect 2 million individuals and result in about 100,000 deaths annually. The use of antimicrobial materials for frequently touched surfaces may be an effective supplement to existing CDC-prescribed hand-washing and disinfection regimens.
In order to submit these claims to the EPA, the surface first had to achieve a 100-percent pass rate of thousands of samples at an independent testing laboratory under the highest laboratory standards available. The samples were tested in various environmental conditions, cleaning protocols, and for  efficacy after repeated exposure. EOS Surfaces also performed extensive ASTM testing to support mechanical performance claims.
Specifically, the following statements are included in the EPA registration:

“This surface continuously reduces bacterial* contamination achieving a 99.9% reduction within two hours of exposure.”
“This surface kills greater than 99.9% of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria* within two hours of exposure.”
“This surface kills greater than 99.9% of bacteria* within two hours and continues to kill 99% of bacteria* even after repeated contamination.”
“This surface helps inhibit the buildup and growth of bacteria* within two hours of exposure between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps.”

*Testing demonstrates effective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterobacter aerogenes (ATCC 13048), Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-ATCC 33592), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 35150) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442).
“This approval affirms what we’ve known for a while, that our surface has the potential to make a real impact with infection rates among hospitals and other health care institutions,” said Ken Trinder, CEO of EOS Surfaces. “Our next goal is to establish a network of distributors, fabricators and end-use partners to get these materials in the field so that it can begin saving lives, keeping people healthier and reducing costs. The EOS Surfaces are designed to be used for countertops, nurses’ stations, wall panels and building components, showers and lavatory fixtures, furniture and tables, and a broad range of other products.”
Cupron and EOS Surfaces will set up a product stewardship program to support the responsible use of the technology and obtain feedback from users of the surface. Cupron and EOS, together with various health care partners, will further evaluate the benefit of antimicrobial-protected surfaces (hard surfaces and textiles) in reducing the amount of disease-causing bacteria in medical facilities.
Cupron and EOS Surfaces jointly developed this material with a range of performance characteristics that provides the mechanical properties of non-porous solid surfaces, the aesthetics for design flexibility and high antimicrobial performance. Because the Cupron technology is embedded throughout the surface, it will not lose its effectiveness over time and wear-and-tear. In fact, it can be fabricated, polished and modified as needed.
Furthermore, EOS is building a new state-of-the-art facility in Norfolk, Virginia for the large-scale manufacturing of Cupron Enhanced EOS. The new facility, expected to begin operation in early 2013, will have specialized equipment that has been designed to commercialize the proprietary technology for a range of products. The new plant will manufacture various thicknesses of Cupron Enhanced EOS cast slabs, perform finishing operations, and will have the capability to manufacture pre-made vanities and other ancillary surfacing products for microbial control.
Health care organizations, architects, health care design consultants or distributors interested in Cupron Enhanced EOS Surfaces can contact EOS Surfaces at 800-719-EOS1 or email at kgt@eos-surfaces.com
The use of the Antimicrobial Cupron Enhanced EOS Surface is a supplement to and not a substitute for standard infection control practices; users must continue to follow all current infection control practices, including those practices related to cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces. The Antimicrobial Cupron Enhanced EOS Surface has been shown to reduce microbial contamination but it does not necessarily prevent cross contamination.

*Testing demonstrates effective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Enterobacter aerogenes (ATCC 13048), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-ATCC 33592), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 35150) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442).
The use of EOScu is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, standard infection control practices; users must continue to follow all current infection control practices, including those practices related to cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces. EOScu has been shown to reduce microbial contamination but it does not necessarily prevent cross contamination. This product must not be waxed, painted, lacquered, varnished, or otherwise coated. This product must be installed by a certified EOScu fabricator only.
