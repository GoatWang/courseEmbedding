General InformationProduct Line CGa Medium  



Medium refers to the substance that carries heat through the heating system. Systems are either designed to use either Hot Water or Steam as a medium, and components are usually specific to one or the other.


Hot Water Heat Exchanger Material Cast Iron Fuel Type  



To create heat, some form of fuel is required. Fuel Type specifies what the product uses as an input to create heat.


Natural Gas Combustion Type Conventional Vent Type  



Products that use combustion (burning) of fuel to create heat also create potentially dangerous gasses that need to be exhausted (AKA "Vented"). Depending on the product, venting can be done via a chimney, through a side wall, or use a second vent to provide fresh air to the appliance.


Chimney Vent DHW Production  



DHW (Domestic Hot Water) is potable water for uses other than space heat. Some boilers are able to provide DHW "out of the box", while others can do so with the purchase of optional accessories.


No Modulating/Staging  



Stages are unique speeds or levels that equipment can operate at. More stages allow for better fine-tuned control of output, which improves comfort and efficiency. Modulating equipment can operate across a range of levels, giving the highest level of fine-tuned control.  Learn More


Single Stage Mount Type Floor Minimum Altitude 0 FeetMaximum Altitude 4500 FeetIncludes Pump Yes Assembly Type Packaged Gas Conversion Kit Available UPC 672619178335 Model 381357804 PerformanceMaximum Input Capacity  



The Maximum Input Capacity describes how quickly the appliance will use fuel when delivering it's maximum capacity. The units may change depending on the fuel being used.


105000 BTUDOE Heating Capacity  



Also referred to as Gross Output, this is the output of a boiler after accounting for combustion efficiency. We recommend sizing hot water boilers based on the DOE Heating Capacity.


88000 BTUNet I=B=R Capacity  



I=B=R, also referred to as Net Output or AHRI Capacity, is the rated heat output of a boiler after accounting for combustion efficiency, piping loss, and an extra pickup factor. We recommend sizing steam boilers based on the I=B=R rating.


77000 BTUAFUE  



AFUE (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency) measures the efficiency of combustion equipment over the entire heating season, and is calculated by dividing the amount of energy that is actually heating your home by the total energy contained in the fuel used by the boiler/furnace. Learn More

Over the last 130 years, Weil-McLain has built a reputation of designing some of the most reliable boilers in the marketplace. Their dedication to producing lasting heating solutions is seen in every boiler they make. The CGa is a compact, natural draft boiler. The low profile makes this boiler perfect for space conscious applications with chimney access. Solid construction and a good efficiency rating make the CGa an excellent value. A vent damper, draft hood, and Taco circulator are included. These components, coupled with easily accessible controls, make it easy to install and set your CGa up. Whether you are replacing an older boiler or beginning new construction, the CGa is an efficient, compact heating solution.Product FeaturesEfficiency-Boosting InsulationHeat retention is critical to energy efficiency. Heat leakage represents energy use without any comfort gains. An extended, insulated steel jacket prevents heat from escaping the CGa and improves the efficiency.Durable ConstructionReliability is one of the greatest ways a boiler can provide value. Weil-McLain wanted to be sure that you'll enjoy the comfort the CGa provides for years to come. With a steel base and burners and cast-iron boiler sections, they have done just that.Product Includes(1) Weil-McLain CGa-4-PIDN Hot Water Boiler(1) Taco 007 Circulator(1) Vent Damper(1) Draft Hood

The Space Shuttle In My Basement
I so appreciate the timely delivery of my new Weil-McLain boiler, model CGa-4. My old boiler (a 44 year old Sears-Roebuck) was on its last leg. I was cleaning it every other day just to keep it running. That's very stressful in the middle of January and the delivery time was important. Thank you! The new boiler runs like the space shuttle! 

I followed the easy installation and start-up instructions, and it fired on the first try. I am a licensed plumber so that helped with the install. Granted, my old boiler was 44 years old, but the efficiency of my new Weil-McLain is unbelievable. What a difference! I am also pleased with the price and free delivery. The best $1,800 I've ever spent. Thank you eComfort and Weil-McLain!I so appreciate the timely delivery of my new Weil-McLain boiler, model CGa-4.

Thank You Great Product With Free Fast Shipping! Would Order Aga
Product was an exact replacement so it was a fairly easy switch that my son and I had complete in about 4 or 5 hours. The only difference is that my old boiler had a standing pilot and this has an auto pilot. Might save some cash on my gas bill. We will see.

This Is My 3rd Weil-mclain Boiler
This one is working great now after I fixed it out of the box.  It would have been nice to have had fire up immediate right after install.  But no it would not lite. 

It was not getting gas to the pilot light due to the supply line from the gas cock was to tight from being stretched to far to left of the gas cock thus by moving it over a row in the burner line up the tension of the gas supply to the pilot opened enough to allow the pilot to lite.

It's now up and running for nearly 3 weeks and it working absolutely great.This one is working great now after I fixed it out of the box.  It would have been nice to have had fire up immediate right after install.  But no it would not lite.

Emergency Replacement
Away from home for the winter. Family checking our home found the problem, needed a new boiler. I was in another state, went online (this boiler was recommended by the professional), able to work well on your web site. 

Called a few times with questions, very helpful. Shipped out immediately. Boiler installed without any problems. I returned home a few weeks later to a warm home new boiler, and every thing working well.
