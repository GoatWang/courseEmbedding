Former Trustee


Brigadier General George H. Walls, Jr. USMC (Ret)
"One of the Marine Corps’ past recruiting slogans was “We Build Mind, Body and Spirit.” I believe that it is necessary to insure that leaders of Marines, present and future, are armed with all the tools necessary to accomplish their mission. Through its support of enhanced educational opportunities, the Marine Corps University Foundation is providing “Ammunition for the Mind.""

George Walls was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in 1965, serving on active duty for over twenty-eight years until retiring at the rank of Brigadier General in 1993. During his military career, he led units at every rank and served in staff assignments in the United States and overseas. He last commanded the Second Force Service Support Group, Camp Lejeune. From 1991 until 1992, he was the Commanding General of the joint task force that provided humanitarian relief to Haitian migrants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Following retirement from active duty he was the Special Assistant to the Chancellor at North Carolina Central University from 1993-2000, with oversight of various University operations, organizational and management issues and special projects. From 2001 through 2004, General Walls was the Chief Deputy Auditor for the State of North Carolina. His responsibilities included oversight of the statewide operations of 194 auditors, administrative and support staff. 
General Walls graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Education from West Chester State College, Pennsylvania, in 1964. In 1975, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Education at North Carolina Central University. His other educational achievements include completion of the U.S. Marine Corps Command and Staff College in 1976 and The National War College in 1983. General Walls was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Virginia Union University; the NAACP's Roy Wilkins Meritorious Service Award and the Humanitarian Service Award from the Chapel of the Four Chaplains. 
In addition to serving as a Trustee and member of the Investment Subcommittee, he also serves as Director on the Boards of: PNC Financial Services and Bank, N.A.; Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.; and the Research Triangle Park Chapter, National Association of Corporate Directors.
 His personal interests include traveling, hunting, fishing and the collection of antique militaria. He and his wife, Portia, have three sons, George III, Steven and Kevin.
