They were part of an original heritage from Singer-Link where they were involved in high-intensity simulation applications such as flight simulators.

The primary businesses continue to be process control focused in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industry, and simulation, which is also focused on fossil and nuclear simulation.
GSE Systems is headquartered in suburban Baltimore, Maryland. Global operations are conducted from offices in Sykesville (Maryland), Nyköping (Sweden), Beijing (China), Stockton-on-Tees (UK), and Chennai (India).

Decommissioning


 
 
 



Critical engineering resources you need, when you need themDecommissioning power plants can seriously disrupt your business as you deal with serious technical and personnel challenges. And even though reactor decommissioning is an inevitable task, it is difficult to find help. GSE has the expertise you need.
 
 



Contact Us
 

When it comes to decommissioning, many of the personnel challenges arise from the fact that you must maintain a competent, motivated staff while they struggle through pending career decisions. This is the time that staff augmentation may be just what you need to support limited-time operations while your original staff transitions to new jobs. As far as costs, in many cases, it is less expensive to outsource this critical work than to pay the premiums for staff to stay on board to the bitter end.

Meet Olivia.
Olivia is an HSE manager at a chemical processing facility that must comply with a variety of regulations regarding hazardous work environments. She is charged with the safety of the workers and responsible for making sure that the plant is compliant. But Olivia has a problem. Workforce attrition has left her with an engineering support staff that is overburdened. There’s no way to handle the critical work that must be done. How can Olivia maintain a safe working environment?

Learn how GSE can help.
 

 
 






Meet Abir.
Abir is plant manager at a fossil fuel power plant undergoing an automation upgrade to a new DCS. That means the plant will be down and not generating revenue. His operators will need to be re-trained on how to best operate the upgraded system. Abir needs to get back online fast with as few delays as possible despite the complexity of the project. Is there a way to help ensure Abir’s capital project is completed on-time and on budget?

Learn how GSE can help.
 

 
 






Meet Carl.
As an operations manager, Carl is tasked with seamless operations while improving performance. He’s trying to maintain production, upgrade new technology and deal with special projects. These projects require special design and engineering skills, but he has neither the budget nor the desire to bring on full-time experts. He also needs professional project management today and continuity when he has new projects down the road. Is there a way to get workers who can support him today and be there in the future? Where can Carl find such “flexible expertise”?

Nuclear Decommissioning
In addition to shutting down the plant, nuclear power plant decommissioning faces the added challenge of working with new operating procedures and philosophies. Once the decision to shut down is made, you must now determine how to run the plant in a totally new environment. Will fuel remain on site? What systems can be decommissioned and which must remain? Will you need a new reactor control room? Will you need new operating procedures and work practices? How will you train the staff for this new environment? Can you minimize operations and maintenance costs while still maintaining your safety margin? How will you reduce exposure to workers entering hazardous areas? Answers to these types of questions may lie at the intersection of plant operations expertise, simulation technology, and visualization.

 
 

 

Nuclear decommissioning is a highly specialized event. To discuss your specific needs, please contact us directly.

 
 



 
 
 
 
 



 
 






Thermal Power Plant Decommissioning
For a shutdown, the personnel challenges arise from the fact that you must maintain a competent, motivated staff while they struggle through pending career decisions. For a re-firing operation, you face an entirely different set of challenges. You need to determine which systems can be decommissioned and which must remain. You will need a new control room. You will certainly need new operating procedures and work practices. And how will you train the staff on safe and proper shutdown and disassembly? Can you minimize operations and maintenance costs while still maintaining your safety margin? Answers to these types of questions may lie at the intersection of plant operations expertise, simulation technology, and visualization.
