                           The Task Force determined that U.S. civilian and military information dissemination capabilities are powerful assets vital
                              to national security. They can create diplomatic opportunities, lessen tensions that might lead to war, help contain conflicts,
                              and address nontraditional threats to America's interests. In the information age, no diplomatic or military strategy can
                              succeed without them. Yet America's political and military leaders too often appreciate their value only during a crisis or
                              in retrospect when hostilities are concluded. Despite the positive benefits that accrue from a robust information dissemination
                              program, the Task Force determined that the U.S. Governments's information dissemination organizations today are understaffed
                              and underfunded. They suffer from poor coordination, and they are not integrated into the national security planning and implementation
                              process. Therefore, the United States needs a sustained, coordinated capability to understand, inform, and influence foreign
                              publics that is rooted in the information age. It should be multi-agency and multi-service, adequately funded and adequately
                              staffed. Its communications channels must be highly differentiated; its technologies state-of-the-art. Products and messages
                              must be credible, consistent, and tailored to different audiences in different cultures. America's leaders need to give information
                              dissemination a much higher priority and be willing to use it to communicate effectively to foreign publics. It is a critical
                              element in all policy planning and implementation

                           It has been more than two generations since the presidency transitioned with American troops engaged in significant combat
                              operations a deployment begun in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Beyond the current military engagements
                              in Iraq and Afghanistan, the nation faces other equally important national security challenges. These include nuclear proliferation,
                              the potential for other regional conflicts into which we could be drawn, and the spread of militarily relevant technology
                              even beyond nation-states. The incoming leadership must be prepared to deal with the most pressing issues facing the Department
                              of Defense today. The pressing issues described herein are daunting and may seem all-inclusive, but they are only a fraction
                              of the defense challenges facing the new administration. This report describes just those issues that the next Secretary of
                              Defense should place at the top of the agenda issues that will require the attention of the Commander-in-Chief, and, if left
                              unresolved, could lead to future military failure. This report offers recommendations drawn from reports prepared by the Defense
                              Science Board, an advisory body to the Secretary of Defense, which address topics at the confluence of technology, policy,
                              and management

                           The United States must be prepared to respond to a broad set of national security missions, both at home and abroad. Yet many
                              deficiencies exist in defense capabilities needed to support these missions - systems are aging and technologies are becoming
                              obsolete. The interoperability of communication systems continues to be a major concern on the battlefield. A robust acquisition
                              process is critical to sustain a strong arsenal of effective weapon systems. This report offers recommendations for rebuilding
                              the defense acquisition process, drawn from numerous reports over the past few years prepared by the Defense Science Board,
                              an advisory body to the Secretary of Defense. We believe this report offers useful insight for the Secretary of Defense and
                              his transition team to address critical acquisition challenges

Vincent Vitto of Lincoln Lab to be Draper president/CEO

Vincent Vitto, an assistant director of Lincoln Laboratory, was elected as the new president and CEO of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc. Mr. Vitto will assume his new position on July 1, when current president and CEO Ralph Jacobson retires. The announcement was made at the March 5 meeting of Draper's board of directors. 
During his 32 years at Lincoln Laboratory, Mr. Vitto served as assistant leader of the Radar Systems Group (1979) and as leader of the Radar Imaging Techniques Group (1982). He also led the Laboratory's work in technology development for space-based radar systems for many years.
Mr. Vitto became associate head of the Aerospace Division in 1984  and moved on to head the Communications Division in 1988. He assumed his current position of assistant director for Surface Surveillance and Communications programs in 1995.
Mr. Vitto serves as a member of the Naval Studies Board of the National Research Council and has been chairman of its Space Panel. He is a member of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board and has been a member and chairman of several Defense Science Board panels.
"It's an exciting opportunity," Mr. Vitto said of his appointment. "I'll be relying on the breadth of experience I acquired at Lincoln and on my involvement in many defense planning studies to extend the technical expertise at Draper to both emerging national defense problems and industrial markets."
