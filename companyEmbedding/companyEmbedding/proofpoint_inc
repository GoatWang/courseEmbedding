Email ProtectionProtect your people from spam, malware, and even non-malware threats with accurate classification, granular control, and visibility into all email communication.
Speak with a specialist 



OverviewProofpoint Email Protection stops malware and non-malware threats such as impostor email (also known as business email compromise, or BEC). Deployed as a cloud service or on-premises, it provides granular filtering to control bulk "graymail" and other unwanted email. And business continuity capabilities keep email communications flowing, even when your email server fails.
 



Features and BenefitsWebinarSchedule Demo 



Protection against BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE (BEC)Dynamically classify impostor email (BEC) other threats that don't involve malware. These low volume, hard-to-detect threats have cost businesses more than $2.3 billion and cannot be detected by solutions that detect only malware. We detect and classify impostor email through a combination of authentication (DMARC), pre-defined rules, and dynamic classification. Our technology actively assesses the reputation of the sender for accurate protection without additional administration overhead. We analyze:


Sender-recipient relationship
Domain reputation
Email headers and envelope attributes
Email content



Video of pfpt-en-direct-email-protection-imposter-emails

Protect your people from impostor email threatsImpostor email, also known as business email compromise (BEC) or CEO fraud, has bilked more than $2.3 billion from more than 17,642 known victims so far.
 




Granular filtering and controlEmail Protection can control all aspects of inbound and outbound email. Our policy engine gives you complete flexibility. Custom rules support global, group and user-level controls to meet the needs of even the most complex enterprise. Individual quarantines enable you to separate email types to allow your people to access their email digest and quarantine while keeping malicious emails away. Quarantines include:

Spam
Impostor
Bulk
Phishing
Malware
Adult
Low Priority

 











"Not only does it keep spam out of our users' mailboxes, it actually keeps spam from hitting our servers in the first place, saving precious resources such as disk space."
— Sam Shoen, WebTeam Manager, U-Haul
Read Our Customer Success StoriesDetailed visibilityEmail Protection gives you a wealth of data and search tools. Our advanced message tracing features a high-performance search engine to help you quickly pinpoint hard-to-find log data based on dozens of search criteria.
With more than 60 real-time reports for detailed visibility into mail flow and trends, Email Protection provides the data that can help address issues and trends as they emerge.
Give your people self-service control over their email preferences such as:

Quarantines
Safe and block lists
Bulk mail delivery

These services are also easy to brand, providing familiarity for users who access these tools. And with support for numerous languages, you can deploy them globally.

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
The company was founded in June 2002 by Eric Hahn, formerly the CTO of Netscape Communications. It launched July 21, 2003, after raising a $7 million Series A funding round, releasing its first product, and lining up six customers as references, and was backed by venture investors Benchmark Capital and Stanford University.[1] An additional $9 million in Series B funding led by New York-based RRE Ventures was announced in October, 2003.[2]
Proofpoint became a publicly traded company in April 2012. At the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the company's shares traded at $13 apiece; investors purchased more than 6.3 million shares through the IPO, raising more than $80 million.[3]




Proofpoint Headquarters, Sunnyvale California


Product History[edit]
The company's first product was the Proofpoint Protection Server for medium and large businesses. It incorporated what was described as "MLX Technology", proprietary machine learning algorithms applied to the problem of accurately identifying spam email using 10,000 different attributes to differentiate between spam and valid email. The company joined dozens of other anti-spam software providers[1] in a business opportunity fueled by an exponential increase in spam volume that was threatening worker productivity, making spam a top business priority.[4] According to the 2004 National Technology Readiness Survey by the Robert H. Smith School of Business and Rockbridge Associates, Inc, the cost of spam in terms of lost productivity had reached $21.58 billion annually.[5] The first Proofpoint Protection Server product upgrade was announced in November 2003 and expanded the number of spam detection attributes to more than 50,000.[6]
Encryption products spurred by HIPAA[edit]
In 2004, strict new regulations governing financial disclosures and the privacy of health care data prompted Proofpoint to begin developing new products that would automatically identify and intercept outbound email containing sensitive information.[7]
In March, 2004, Proofpoint introduced its first hardware appliance, the P-Series Message Protection Appliance (later renamed Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway), using a hardened Linux kernel and Proofpoint's Protection Server 2.0 software.[8] It was tested by Infoworld and found to stop 94% of spam.[9]
Another product introduction in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments to assist in compliance with data protection regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In combination, this was known as the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Appliance. It was reviewed by ChannelWeb ProofPoint Appliance Stands Guard At E-Mail Gate, ChannelWeb, Nov 26, 2004, which observed that it used a "combination of technologies: policy-based management, a spam-filtering engine and adaptive learning technology".
Proofpoint introduced a new product, the Network Content Sentry, as an add-on appliance to the Content Security Suite in August, 2005.[10] Designed to monitor online messaging other than email, the appliance monitors Web mail, message boards, blogs and FTP-based communications. Proofpoint also introduced policy-based email encryption features, using identity-based encryption technology licensed from Voltage Security.
Virtual appliance development[edit]
In a step towards simpler operational requirements, the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Virtual Edition was released in April 2007. The product runs as a virtual appliance on a host running VMware's virtual server software.[11] Moving a dedicated hardware appliance to a virtual server eliminates problems associated with proprietary hardware and reduces upgrade costs,[12] though it does require knowledge of VMware's virtual server architecture.
Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway V5.0 was released in June 2007, and was based on a new, integrated architecture, combining all its capabilities into a single platform.[13] It could be run either as a dedicated appliance, virtual appliance, or software suite.
ICSA Labs, an independent division of Verizon Business, announced in April 2007, that it had certified six anti-spam products under their new testing program, one of which was the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway. The goal of ICSA Labs' anti-spam product testing and certification is to evaluate product effectiveness in detecting and removing spam. The guidelines also address how well the products recognize e-mail messages from legitimate sources.[14]
Software as a Service[edit]
Moving into the software-as-a-service business, Proofpoint introduced Proofpoint on Demand, a hosted version of its email security and data loss prevention offerings.[15] In May, 2008, the company’s hosted offerings were expanded with the introduction of Proofpoint on Demand—Standard Edition.[16] The product is targeted at small-to-medium size businesses that need email security but do not run their own servers or have on-site IT personnel.
Products[edit]
Proofpoint products are designed to solve three business problems: advanced cybersecurity threats, regulatory compliance, and brand-impostor fraud (which it calls “digital risk”). These products work across email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud. [17][18][19][20]
Email Security[edit]
In June 2008, Proofpoint acquired Fortiva, Inc., a provider of on-demand Email archiving software for legal discovery, regulatory compliance and email storage management.[26] Fortiva used Exchange journaling to automatically archive all internal and external communications so that end users can search all archived messages, including attachments, directly from a search folder in Outlook.[21]
Cybersecurity[edit]
Proofpoint’s security portfolio includes products that stop both traditional cyberattacks (delivered via malicious attachments and URLs) and socially engineered attacks—such as business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing—that do not use malware.[22] It uses a blend of sandbox analysis, reputational analysis, automated threat data, human threat intelligence and attributes such as sender/recipient relationship, headers, and content, and more to detect potential threats. Automated encryption, data-loss prevention and forensics-gathering tools are designed to speed incident response and mitigate the damage and costs of any threats that do get through. The portfolio also includes protection from social-media account takeovers, harmful mobile apps, and rogue Wi-Fi networks.
Regulatory Compliance[edit]
Proofpoint’s compliance products are designed to reduce the manual labor involved in identifying potentially sensitive data, managing and supervising it in compliance with government and industry rules, and producing  it quickly in e-discovery legal requests.[23]
Digital Risk[edit]
Proofpoint’s digital risk products are aimed at companies seeking to stop cybercriminals from impersonating their brand to harm customers, partners, and the brand’s reputation. Its email digital risk portfolio includes authentication technology to prevent email domain spoofing.[24] On social media, it stops scams in which fraudsters create fake customer-service accounts to find people seeking help over social media and trick them into handing over account credentials or visiting a malicious website.[25] And in mobile, it finds counterfeit apps distributed through mobile app stores.[26]
In the 2016 Forrester Wave™ for Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016 the Proofpoint digital risk / social media product was included in an evaluation of the nine top vendors in this emerging market. These solutions monitor “digital”—i.e., social, mobile, web, and dark web—channels to detect, prevent, malicious or unwanted content from undermining organizational efforts to build brand across all major social media platforms.[20] On Oct 23, 2014 Proofpoint acquired Nexgate, Inc. a social media and security compliance vendor. On Nov 4, 2015 Proofpoint acquired Socialware Inc a compliance workflow & content capture and review technology company.
Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts include:
The 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016[citation needed] Gartner Inc. Magic Quadrant identified Proofpoint, Inc. as a leader in the “Magic Quadrant for Secure Email Gateways” for the seventh consecutive year. [27][28][29][30]
The 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Gartner Inc. Magic Quadrant identified Proofpoint, Inc. as a leader in the "Enterprise Information Archiving" report. [31][32]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
The company was founded in June 2002 by Eric Hahn, formerly the CTO of Netscape Communications. It launched July 21, 2003, after raising a $7 million Series A funding round, releasing its first product, and lining up six customers as references, and was backed by venture investors Benchmark Capital and Stanford University.[1] An additional $9 million in Series B funding led by New York-based RRE Ventures was announced in October, 2003.[2]
Proofpoint became a publicly traded company in April 2012. At the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the company's shares traded at $13 apiece; investors purchased more than 6.3 million shares through the IPO, raising more than $80 million.[3]

Product History[edit]
The company's first product was the Proofpoint Protection Server for medium and large businesses. It incorporated what was described as "MLX Technology", proprietary machine learning algorithms applied to the problem of accurately identifying spam email using 10,000 different attributes to differentiate between spam and valid email. The company joined dozens of other anti-spam software providers[1] in a business opportunity fueled by an exponential increase in spam volume that was threatening worker productivity, making spam a top business priority.[4] According to the 2004 National Technology Readiness Survey by the Robert H. Smith School of Business and Rockbridge Associates, Inc, the cost of spam in terms of lost productivity had reached $21.58 billion annually.[5] The first Proofpoint Protection Server product upgrade was announced in November 2003 and expanded the number of spam detection attributes to more than 50,000.[6]
Encryption products spurred by HIPAA[edit]
In 2004, strict new regulations governing financial disclosures and the privacy of health care data prompted Proofpoint to begin developing new products that would automatically identify and intercept outbound email containing sensitive information.[7]
In March, 2004, Proofpoint introduced its first hardware appliance, the P-Series Message Protection Appliance (later renamed Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway), using a hardened Linux kernel and Proofpoint's Protection Server 2.0 software.[8] It was tested by Infoworld and found to stop 94% of spam.[9]
Another product introduction in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments to assist in compliance with data protection regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In combination, this was known as the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Appliance. It was reviewed by ChannelWeb ProofPoint Appliance Stands Guard At E-Mail Gate, ChannelWeb, Nov 26, 2004, which observed that it used a "combination of technologies: policy-based management, a spam-filtering engine and adaptive learning technology".
Proofpoint introduced a new product, the Network Content Sentry, as an add-on appliance to the Content Security Suite in August, 2005.[10] Designed to monitor online messaging other than email, the appliance monitors Web mail, message boards, blogs and FTP-based communications. Proofpoint also introduced policy-based email encryption features, using identity-based encryption technology licensed from Voltage Security.
Virtual appliance development[edit]
In a step towards simpler operational requirements, the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Virtual Edition was released in April 2007. The product runs as a virtual appliance on a host running VMware's virtual server software.[11] Moving a dedicated hardware appliance to a virtual server eliminates problems associated with proprietary hardware and reduces upgrade costs,[12] though it does require knowledge of VMware's virtual server architecture.
Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway V5.0 was released in June 2007, and was based on a new, integrated architecture, combining all its capabilities into a single platform.[13] It could be run either as a dedicated appliance, virtual appliance, or software suite.
ICSA Labs, an independent division of Verizon Business, announced in April 2007, that it had certified six anti-spam products under their new testing program, one of which was the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway. The goal of ICSA Labs' anti-spam product testing and certification is to evaluate product effectiveness in detecting and removing spam. The guidelines also address how well the products recognize e-mail messages from legitimate sources.[14]
Software as a Service[edit]
Moving into the software-as-a-service business, Proofpoint introduced Proofpoint on Demand, a hosted version of its email security and data loss prevention offerings.[15] In May, 2008, the company’s hosted offerings were expanded with the introduction of Proofpoint on Demand—Standard Edition.[16] The product is targeted at small-to-medium size businesses that need email security but do not run their own servers or have on-site IT personnel.
Products[edit]
Proofpoint products are designed to solve three business problems: advanced cybersecurity threats, regulatory compliance, and brand-impostor fraud (which it calls “digital risk”). These products work across email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud. [17][18][19][20]
Email Security[edit]
In June 2008, Proofpoint acquired Fortiva, Inc., a provider of on-demand Email archiving software for legal discovery, regulatory compliance and email storage management.[26] Fortiva used Exchange journaling to automatically archive all internal and external communications so that end users can search all archived messages, including attachments, directly from a search folder in Outlook.[21]
Cybersecurity[edit]
Proofpoint’s security portfolio includes products that stop both traditional cyberattacks (delivered via malicious attachments and URLs) and socially engineered attacks—such as business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing—that do not use malware.[22] It uses a blend of sandbox analysis, reputational analysis, automated threat data, human threat intelligence and attributes such as sender/recipient relationship, headers, and content, and more to detect potential threats. Automated encryption, data-loss prevention and forensics-gathering tools are designed to speed incident response and mitigate the damage and costs of any threats that do get through. The portfolio also includes protection from social-media account takeovers, harmful mobile apps, and rogue Wi-Fi networks.
Regulatory Compliance[edit]
Proofpoint’s compliance products are designed to reduce the manual labor involved in identifying potentially sensitive data, managing and supervising it in compliance with government and industry rules, and producing  it quickly in e-discovery legal requests.[23]
Digital Risk[edit]
Proofpoint’s digital risk products are aimed at companies seeking to stop cybercriminals from impersonating their brand to harm customers, partners, and the brand’s reputation. Its email digital risk portfolio includes authentication technology to prevent email domain spoofing.[24] On social media, it stops scams in which fraudsters create fake customer-service accounts to find people seeking help over social media and trick them into handing over account credentials or visiting a malicious website.[25] And in mobile, it finds counterfeit apps distributed through mobile app stores.[26]
In the 2016 Forrester Wave™ for Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016 the Proofpoint digital risk / social media product was included in an evaluation of the nine top vendors in this emerging market. These solutions monitor “digital”—i.e., social, mobile, web, and dark web—channels to detect, prevent, malicious or unwanted content from undermining organizational efforts to build brand across all major social media platforms.[20] On Oct 23, 2014 Proofpoint acquired Nexgate, Inc. a social media and security compliance vendor. On Nov 4, 2015 Proofpoint acquired Socialware Inc a compliance workflow & content capture and review technology company.
Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts include:
The 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016[citation needed] Gartner Inc. Magic Quadrant identified Proofpoint, Inc. as a leader in the “Magic Quadrant for Secure Email Gateways” for the seventh consecutive year. [27][28][29][30]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
The company was founded in June 2002 by Eric Hahn, formerly the CTO of Netscape Communications. It launched July 21, 2003, after raising a $7 million Series A funding round, releasing its first product, and lining up six customers as references, and was backed by venture investors Benchmark Capital and Stanford University.[1] An additional $9 million in Series B funding led by New York-based RRE Ventures was announced in October, 2003.[2]
Proofpoint became a publicly traded company in April 2012. At the time of its initial public offering (IPO), the company's shares traded at $13 apiece; investors purchased more than 6.3 million shares through the IPO, raising more than $80 million.[3]




Proofpoint Headquarters, Sunnyvale California


Product History[edit]
The company's first product was the Proofpoint Protection Server for medium and large businesses. It incorporated what was described as "MLX Technology", proprietary machine learning algorithms applied to the problem of accurately identifying spam email using 10,000 different attributes to differentiate between spam and valid email. The company joined dozens of other anti-spam software providers[1] in a business opportunity fueled by an exponential increase in spam volume that was threatening worker productivity, making spam a top business priority.[4] According to the 2004 National Technology Readiness Survey by the Robert H. Smith School of Business and Rockbridge Associates, Inc, the cost of spam in terms of lost productivity had reached $21.58 billion annually.[5] The first Proofpoint Protection Server product upgrade was announced in November 2003 and expanded the number of spam detection attributes to more than 50,000.[6]
Encryption products spurred by HIPAA[edit]
In 2004, strict new regulations governing financial disclosures and the privacy of health care data prompted Proofpoint to begin developing new products that would automatically identify and intercept outbound email containing sensitive information.[7]
In March, 2004, Proofpoint introduced its first hardware appliance, the P-Series Message Protection Appliance (later renamed Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway), using a hardened Linux kernel and Proofpoint's Protection Server 2.0 software.[8] It was tested by Infoworld and found to stop 94% of spam.[9]
Another product introduction in November, 2004 included Protection Server 3.0, with Email Firewall and MLX-based Dynamic Reputation Analysis, and the Content Security Suite, plug-in modules designed for scanning outbound messages and their attachments to assist in compliance with data protection regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley. In combination, this was known as the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Appliance. It was reviewed by ChannelWeb ProofPoint Appliance Stands Guard At E-Mail Gate, ChannelWeb, Nov 26, 2004, which observed that it used a "combination of technologies: policy-based management, a spam-filtering engine and adaptive learning technology".
Proofpoint introduced a new product, the Network Content Sentry, as an add-on appliance to the Content Security Suite in August, 2005.[10] Designed to monitor online messaging other than email, the appliance monitors Web mail, message boards, blogs and FTP-based communications. Proofpoint also introduced policy-based email encryption features, using identity-based encryption technology licensed from Voltage Security.
Virtual appliance development[edit]
In a step towards simpler operational requirements, the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway Virtual Edition was released in April 2007. The product runs as a virtual appliance on a host running VMware's virtual server software.[11] Moving a dedicated hardware appliance to a virtual server eliminates problems associated with proprietary hardware and reduces upgrade costs,[12] though it does require knowledge of VMware's virtual server architecture.
Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway V5.0 was released in June 2007, and was based on a new, integrated architecture, combining all its capabilities into a single platform.[13] It could be run either as a dedicated appliance, virtual appliance, or software suite.
ICSA Labs, an independent division of Verizon Business, announced in April 2007, that it had certified six anti-spam products under their new testing program, one of which was the Proofpoint Messaging Security Gateway. The goal of ICSA Labs' anti-spam product testing and certification is to evaluate product effectiveness in detecting and removing spam. The guidelines also address how well the products recognize e-mail messages from legitimate sources.[14]
Software as a Service[edit]
Moving into the software-as-a-service business, Proofpoint introduced Proofpoint on Demand, a hosted version of its email security and data loss prevention offerings.[15] In May, 2008, the company’s hosted offerings were expanded with the introduction of Proofpoint on Demand—Standard Edition.[16] The product is targeted at small-to-medium size businesses that need email security but do not run their own servers or have on-site IT personnel.
Products[edit]
Proofpoint products are designed to solve three business problems: advanced cybersecurity threats, regulatory compliance, and brand-impostor fraud (which it calls “digital risk”). These products work across email, social media, mobile devices, and the cloud. [17][18][19][20]
Email Security[edit]
In June 2008, Proofpoint acquired Fortiva, Inc., a provider of on-demand Email archiving software for legal discovery, regulatory compliance and email storage management.[26] Fortiva used Exchange journaling to automatically archive all internal and external communications so that end users can search all archived messages, including attachments, directly from a search folder in Outlook.[21]
Cybersecurity[edit]
Proofpoint’s security portfolio includes products that stop both traditional cyberattacks (delivered via malicious attachments and URLs) and socially engineered attacks—such as business email compromise (BEC) and credential phishing—that do not use malware.[22] It uses a blend of sandbox analysis, reputational analysis, automated threat data, human threat intelligence and attributes such as sender/recipient relationship, headers, and content, and more to detect potential threats. Automated encryption, data-loss prevention and forensics-gathering tools are designed to speed incident response and mitigate the damage and costs of any threats that do get through. The portfolio also includes protection from social-media account takeovers, harmful mobile apps, and rogue Wi-Fi networks.
Regulatory Compliance[edit]
Proofpoint’s compliance products are designed to reduce the manual labor involved in identifying potentially sensitive data, managing and supervising it in compliance with government and industry rules, and producing  it quickly in e-discovery legal requests.[23]
Digital Risk[edit]
Proofpoint’s digital risk products are aimed at companies seeking to stop cybercriminals from impersonating their brand to harm customers, partners, and the brand’s reputation. Its email digital risk portfolio includes authentication technology to prevent email domain spoofing.[24] On social media, it stops scams in which fraudsters create fake customer-service accounts to find people seeking help over social media and trick them into handing over account credentials or visiting a malicious website.[25] And in mobile, it finds counterfeit apps distributed through mobile app stores.[26]
In the 2016 Forrester Wave™ for Digital Risk Monitoring, Q3 2016 the Proofpoint digital risk / social media product was included in an evaluation of the nine top vendors in this emerging market. These solutions monitor “digital”—i.e., social, mobile, web, and dark web—channels to detect, prevent, malicious or unwanted content from undermining organizational efforts to build brand across all major social media platforms.[20] On Oct 23, 2014 Proofpoint acquired Nexgate, Inc. a social media and security compliance vendor. On Nov 4, 2015 Proofpoint acquired Socialware Inc a compliance workflow & content capture and review technology company.
Recognition[edit]
Recognition from industry analysts include:
The 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016[citation needed] Gartner Inc. Magic Quadrant identified Proofpoint, Inc. as a leader in the “Magic Quadrant for Secure Email Gateways” for the seventh consecutive year. [27][28][29][30]

The Company's security-as-a-service platform consists of an integrated suite of on-demand data protection solutions, including threat protection, incident response, regulatory compliance, archiving, governance, eDiscovery and secure communication. The Company's solutions are built on a cloud-based platform. The Company provides a multi-tiered security-as-a-service platform, including solutions, platform technologies and infrastructure. Its product families include Email Security, Proofpoint Advanced Threat Protection, Proofpoint Information Protection and Archiving, and Proofpoint Digital Risk Protection.The Company's platform services include Threat detection, Threat intel extraction, Nexus threat graph, Real-time detection, Information classification and Intelligent policy. The Company's enabling technologies consist of Big data analytics, including indexes and analyzes petabytes of information in real-time to discover threats, detect data leaks and enable end users to access information distributed across their organizations; Machine learning, including building predictive data models using its Proofpoint MLX machine learning techniques to identify and classify threats and sensitive content in real-time; Identity and policy, which enables the definition and enforcement of data protection policies based on a set of variables, including type of content, sender, recipient, pending legal matters, time and date, and regulatory status, and Virtual execution environments, which exposes suspected malware to a permuted set of instrumented virtual system environments, to assess maliciousness, exploit activity and compromise processes. Its technologies also include Intelligent message routing and Threat intelligence correlation. The Company delivers its security-as-a-service solutions through its cloud architecture and international data center infrastructure. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated thousands of physical and virtual servers across 11 data centers located in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and Germany.Email SecurityThe Email Security Product family includes the Enterprise Protection secure e-mail gateway, Email Fraud Defense, Email Continuity and Proofpoint Essentials. Enterprise Protection uses its Proofpoint MLX machine learning technology and reputation data to examine millions of possible attributes in every message to block phishing and spear phishing attacks, spam, viruses, impostor e-mail/business e-mail compromise attacks, and other forms of malicious or objectionable content. Email Fraud Defense enables organizations to understand who is sending e-mail from their domains, and create a policy to both authenticate legitimate e-mail and block fraudulent e-mail. Email Continuity allows organizations to maintain e-mail communications if their on-premises or cloud-based e-mail servers experience an outage. Proofpoint Essentials is a suite of security-as-a-service and compliance solutions designed for distribution across managed service providers and dedicated security resellers.Proofpoint Advanced Threat ProtectionThe Company's advanced threat protection products are capable of detecting and preventing threats across e-mail, social media, mobile applications and software as a service (SaaS) applications. It offers capabilities, such as Targeted attack protection and Threat response. Targeted attack protection allows enterprises to be protected against both commodity, and advanced threats, such as phishing and other targeted e-mail attacks by the use of big data analysis, predictive, virtual execution and dynamic malware analysis techniques to identify and apply additional security controls against suspicious messages and any associated links to the Web. Threat response provides threat information and indicators of compromise (IoCs) correlation, aggregating across Proofpoint and other third-party security products, to confirm and contain system compromises.Proofpoint Information Protection and ArchivingThe Company's data loss prevention, encryption and compliance solution defends against leaks of confidential information. Proofpoint Information Protection and Archiving includes capabilities, such as Advanced data loss prevention, Flexible remediation and supervision, Policy-based encryption, Secure share, Data Discover, Secure cloud storage, Search performance, Flexible policy enforcement, Active legal-hold management and End-user supervision. Its advanced data loss prevention solution identifies regulated private content, valuable corporate assets and confidential information before it leaves the organization through e-mail, Web-based applications, or its Secure Share solution. Remediation options include stopping the transfer completely, automatically forcing data-encryption, or routing to a compliance supervisor or the end user for disposition. It automatically encrypts regulated and other sensitive data before it leaves an organization's security perimeter without requiring cumbersome end user key management. It offers an automated discovery and remediation solution. With its double blind encryption technology and the associated data storage architecture, all e-mail messages, files and other content are encrypted with keys controlled by the customer before the data enters the Proofpoint Enterprise Archive. It enables administrators or legal professionals to designate specific individuals or content as subject to legal-hold. Leveraging its flexible workflow capabilities, Proofpoint Enterprise Archive analyzes all electronic communications, including e-mail and communications from instant messaging and social networking sites, for potential violations of regulations.Proofpoint Digital Risk ProtectionThe Proofpoint Digital Risk Protection product family includes features, such as Detecting Brand Fraud, Detecting External Threats and Compliance Monitoring and Protection. Its cloud-based platform allows customers to find fraudulent social media accounts, Web domains and mobile applications that are affiliated with their brands. External threat management tools enable organizations to identify leaked intellectual property, credentials, and customer data on the Web or dark Web. Leveraging social media application program interfaces (APIs), the platform can monitor and apply content policies to the brand's owned social media accounts for security, compliance and acceptable use.The Company competes with Cisco Systems, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, FireEye, Inc., Symantec Corporation, Micro Focus International plc, Veritas Technologies LLC and Google Inc.

Protect Email, Social, And MobileProtect the way your people work  today—in email, social media, WiFi hotspots, and mobile apps.
Learn More 



OverviewThe way we work is changing, and so are today’s cyber attacks. Stop threats from exploiting your people and the tools they use to compromise your endpoints, steal your credentials, and access your data.
We help you protect the way your people work by detecting and managing advanced threats and compliance risks. Our advanced threat solutions work across email, social media, WiFi hotspots, and mobile apps to help safeguard what matters most. We protect your critical information and equip you with the right intelligence and tools to respond quickly when things go wrong.
 





Solutions to Protect Email, Social, and Mobile

 




Protect people and data everywhereIn the modern enterprise, your people, data, and devices can be anywhere. Traditional security products are designed to protect information residing on or traversing the corporate network. As business applications move to the cloud, so are threats—bypassing security at the corporate perimeter. That is why today’s defenses must work everywhere. Our products work where sensitive content is transferred or accessed: on the mail transfer agent, mobile app store, mobile hotspots or social media platform. This gives us greater context to analyze and extract threat intelligence, reduce the attack surface, and reduce your attack risk.

Learn More about Advanced Threat Protection
 





Deploy quickly, see value immediatelyCloud-based platforms such as Office 365, mobile apps, and social media require cloud-based protection. Our cloud architecture enables you to deploy quickly and derive value immediately. You can protect hundreds of thousands of users in days—not weeks or months. We use the cloud to update our software every day to instantly incorporate new features and help you stay ahead of attackers. Our cloud-based deployment also gives you the flexibility to protect users on any network or device.

Learn More about Technology Platform 




Get unmatched threat intelligenceWe are the only company with threat intelligence that spans email, networks, social media, and mobile apps. We take our threat intelligence to the next level by applying what we learn about every threat back into our products in actionable, meaningful ways.
