Median Group Inc. - Launch of m-Commerce Services with Angkasa and Website



Share Article

















To become the next full blown premiere digital service provider MVNO through a collaborative partnership with ANGKASA by introducing a mobile service focusing on providing an integrated digital service, which is seamless, flexible and in real time.






Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (PRWEB)
April 22, 2016
 Median Group Inc. today announce it has signed an exclusive collaborative agreement with Myangkasa Holdings SDN BHD, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Malaysian National Co-operative Organisation (ANGKASA) to launch a mobile commerce service under its Mobile Virtual Network Operator platform.
Median, through its subsidiary Naim Indah Mobile Communications SDN BHD (“NIMC”), is en-route to becoming Asia’s next full-blown premiere digital service provider (DSP) MVNO through a collaborative partnership with ANGKASA. Soon to hit the country’s telecommunication market, NIMC is introducing a mobile service focusing on providing an integrated digital service, which is seamless, flexible and in real time. Above all, the service enables subscribers to interact and transact online, across devices and be personalized to suit the demand of current consumers.
Not provided by other operators in Malaysia, the new MVNO service to be offered by NIMC and Mangkasa will be the first-of-its-kind as it has a technology superiority and scalability that will give protection and support for future growth.
ANGKASA is an apex cooperative recognized by the Malaysian government as de-facto body of cooperative movement in the country. With over 7.4 million ANGKASA registered members, it is by far, the largest community-based group in Malaysia, representing over 30% of the total Malaysian population and constitute about 57.5% of the total work force in Malaysia. ANGKASA is under the purview of the Co-operatives Commission of Malaysia, the regulatory agency within the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Consumers and Co-operatives Development.
