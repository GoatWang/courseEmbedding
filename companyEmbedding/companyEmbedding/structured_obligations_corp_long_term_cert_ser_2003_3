A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS).[1] Originally developed for the corporate debt markets, over time CDOs evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgage-backed security ("MBS") markets.[2]
Like other private label securities backed by assets, a CDO can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence, based on the cash flow the CDO collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns. The CDO is "sliced" into "tranches", which "catch" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.[3] If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most "junior" tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, coupon payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk. As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as "super senior"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.[4]
Separate special purpose entities—rather than the parent investment bank—issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration, known as "CDO-squared", "CDOs of CDOs" or "synthetic CDOs".[4]
In the early 2000s, CDOs were generally diversified,[5] but by 2006–2007—when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this changed. CDO collateral became dominated not by loans, but by lower level (BBB or A) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually sub-prime mortgages,[6] and are known as a synthetic CDO. These CDOs have been called "the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain" for sub-prime mortgages,[7] and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make sub-prime loans[8] leading up to the 2007-9 subprime mortgage crisis.

Market history[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
The first CDO was issued in 1987 by bankers at now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for the also now-defunct Imperial Savings Association.[9] During the 1990s the collateral of CDOs was generally corporate and emerging market bonds and bank loans.[10] After 1998 "multi-sector" CDOs were developed by Prudential Securities,[11] but CDOs remained fairly obscure until after 2000.[12] In 2002 and 2003 CDOs had a setback when rating agencies "were forced to downgrade hundreds" of the securities,[13] but sales of CDOs grew—from $69 billion in 2000 to around $500 billion in 2006.[14] From 2004 through 2007, $1.4 trillion worth of CDOs were issued.[15]
Early CDOs were diversified, and might include everything from aircraft lease-equipment debt, manufactured housing loans, to student loans and credit card debt. The diversification of borrowers in these "multisector CDOs" was a selling point, as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted, other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected.[16] Another selling point was that CDOs offered returns that were sometimes 2-3 percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating.[16][17]
Explanations for growth[edit]

Advantages of securitization -- Depository banks had incentive to "securitize" loans they originated—often in the form of CDO securities—because this removes the loans from their books. The transfer of these loans (along with related risk) to security-buying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks' capital. This enabled them to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees.
Global demand for fixed income investments -- From 2000 to 2007 worldwide fixed income investment (i.e. investments in bonds and other conservative securities) roughly doubled in size to $70 trillion, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast, which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates.[18][19] Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage-backed security (MBS) and collateralized debt obligation (CDO), which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies.[19]
Low interest rates -- Fears of deflation, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a U.S. recession, and the U.S. trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from 2000 to 2004-5, according to Economist Mark Zandi.[20] The low yield of the safe US Treasury bonds created demand by global investors for subprime mortgage-backed CDOs with their relatively high-yields but credit ratings as high as the Treasuries. This search for yield by global investors caused many to purchase CDOs, though they lived to regret trusting the credit rating agencies' ratings.[21]
Pricing models -- Gaussian copula models, introduced in 2001 by David X. Li, allowed for the rapid pricing of CDOs.[22][23]

Main article: Subprime mortgage crisis
See also: Subprime lending and Bear Stearns subprime mortgage hedge fund crisis
Around 2005, as the CDO market continued to grow, subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral. By 2004, mortgage-backed securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in CDOs.[7][25][26][27][28][29] According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, "the CDO became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain",[7] promoting an increase in demand for mortgage-backed securities without which lenders would have "had less reason to push so hard to make" non-prime loans.[8] CDOs not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgage-backed securities, they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities.[7] Between 2003 and 2007, Wall Street issued almost $700 billion in CDOs that included mortgage-backed securities as collateral.[7] Despite this loss of diversification, CDO tranches were given the same proportion of high ratings by rating agencies[30] on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so "uncorrelated"[31]—though those ratings were lowered after mortgage holders began to default.[32][33]
The rise of "ratings arbitrage"—i.e. pooling low-rated tranches to make CDOs—helped push sales of CDOs to about $500 billion in 2006,[14] with a global CDO market of over USD $1.5 trillion.[34] CDO was the fastest-growing sector of the structured finance market between 2003 and 2006; the number of CDO tranches issued in 2006 (9,278) was almost twice the number of tranches issued in 2005 (4,706).[35]
CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course.[36]
Explanations for growth[edit]
Subprime mortgages had been financed by mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Like CDOs, MBSs were structured into tranches, but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower level/lower-rated "mezzanine" tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from AA to BB.

Because most traditional mortgage investors are risk-averse, either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices, they are interested in buying the higher-rated segments of the loan stack; as a result, those slices are easiest to sell. The more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile. The way mortgage securities are structured, if you cannot find buyers for the lower-rated slices, the rest of the pool cannot be sold.[37][38]

To deal with the problem investment bankers "recycled" the mezzanine tranches, selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—CDOs. Though the pool that made up the CDO collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches, most of the tranches (70[39] to 80%[40][41]) of the CDO were rated not BBB, A-, etc., but triple A. The minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other CDOs, concentrating the lower rated tranches still further. (see chart on "The Theory of How the Financial System Created AAA-rated Assets out of Subprime Mortgages")
As one journalist (Gretchen Morgenson) put it, CDOs became "the perfect dumping ground for the low-rated slices Wall Street couldn't sell on its own."[37]
Other factors explaining the popularity of CDOs include:

Growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued.[18][19] A "global savings glut"[42] leading to "large capital inflows" from abroad helped finance the housing boom, keeping down US mortgage rates, even after the Federal Reserve Bank had raised interest rates to cool off the economy.[43]
Supply generated by "hefty" fees the CDO industry earned. According to "one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in CDOs", as much "as 40 to 50 percent" of the cash flow generated by the assets in a CDO went to "pay the bankers, the CDO manager, the rating agencies, and others who took out fees."[13] Rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the CDO tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by CDO issuers—earned extraordinary profits. Moody's Investors Service, one of the two biggest rating agencies, could earn "as much as $250,000 to rate a mortgage pool with $350 million in assets, versus the $50,000 in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size." In 2006, revenues from Moody's structured finance division "accounted for fully 44%" of all Moody's sales.[44][45] Moody's operating margins were "consistently over 50%, making it one of the most profitable companies in existence"—more profitable in terms of margins than Exxon Mobil or Microsoft.[46] Between the time Moody's was spun off as a public company and February 2007, its stock rose 340%.[46][47]
Trust in rating agencies. CDO managers "didn't always have to disclose what the securities contained" because the contents of the CDO were subject to change. But this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities. Investors "weren't so much buying a security. They were buying a triple-A rating," according to business journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera.[13]
Financial innovations, such as credit default swaps and synthetic CDO. Credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premium-like payments, making CDOs appear "to be virtually risk-free" to investors.[48] Synthetic CDOs were cheaper and easier to create than original "cash" CDOs. Synthetics "referenced" cash CDOs, replacing interest payments from MBS tranches with premium-like payments from credit default swaps. Rather than providing funding for housing, synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default.[49] If the CDO did not perform per contractual requirements, one counterparty (typically a large investment bank or hedge fund) had to pay another.[50] As underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated, subprime mortgages became less abundant. Synthetic CDOs began to fill in for the original cash CDOs. Because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original, the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically.

Crash[edit]




More than half of the highest-rated (Aaa) CDOs were "impaired" (losing principal or downgraded to junk status), compared to a small fraction of similarly rated Subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities. (source: Financial Crisis Inquiry Report[51])


In the summer of 2006, the Case-Shiller index of house prices peaked.[52] In California home prices had more than doubled since 2000[53] and median house prices in Los Angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income. To entice the low and moderate income to sign up for mortgages, down payments, income documentation were often dispensed with and interest and principal payments were often deferred upon request.[54] Journalist Michael Lewis gave as an example of unsustainable underwriting practices a loan in Bakersfield, California, where "a Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 and no English was lent every penny he needed to buy a house of $724,000".[54] As two-year "teaser" mortgage rates - common with those that made home purchases like this possible - expired, mortgage payments skyrocketed. Refinancing to lower mortgage payment was no longer available since it depended on rising home prices.[55] Mezzanine tranches started to lose value in 2007, by mid year AA tranches were worth only 70 cents on the dollar. By October triple-A tranches had started to fall.[56] Regional diversification notwithstanding, the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated.[10]
Big CDO arrangers like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and UBS experienced some of the biggest losses, as did financial guaranteers such as AIG, Ambac, MBIA.[10]
An early indicator of the crisis came in July 2007 when rating agencies made unprecedented mass downgrades of mortgage-related securities[57] (by the end of 2008 91% of CDO securities were downgraded[58]), and two highly leveraged Bear Stearns hedge funds holding MBSs and CDOs collapsed. Investors were informed by Bear Stearns that they would get little if any of their money back.[59][60]
In October and November the CEOs of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup resigned after reporting multibillion-dollar losses and CDO downgrades.[61][62][63] As the global market for CDOs dried up[64][65] the new issue pipeline for CDOs slowed significantly,[66] and what CDO issuance there was usually in the form of collateralized loan obligations backed by middle-market or leveraged bank loans, rather than home mortgage ABS.[67] The CDO collapse hurt mortgage credit available to homeowners since the bigger MBS market depended on CDO purchases of mezzanine tranches.[68][69]
While non-prime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages, CDOs were especially hard hit. More than half -- $300 billion worth—of tranches issued in 2005, 2006, and 2007 rated most safe—triple A -- by rating agencies, were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by 2009.[51] In comparison, only small fractions of triple A tranches of Alt-A or subprime mortgage-backed securities suffered the same fate. (see Impaired Securities chart)
Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) also made up over half ($542 billion) of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from 2007 to early 2009.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Prior to the crisis, a few academics, analysts and investors such as Warren Buffett (who famously disparaged CDOs and other derivatives as "financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal"[70]), and the IMF's former chief economist Raghuram Rajan[71] warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification, CDOs and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widely.[citation needed]
During and after the crisis, criticism of the CDO market was more vocal. According to the radio documentary "Giant Pool of Money", it was the strong demand for MBS and CDO, that drove down home lending standards. Mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted.[19]
The head of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, Patrick Parkinson, termed "the whole concept of ABS CDOs", an "abomination".[10]
In December 2007, journalists Carrick Mollenkamp and Serena Ng wrote of a CDO called Norma created by Merrill Lynch at the behest of Illinois hedge fund, Magnetar. It was a tailor-made bet on subprime mortgages that went "too far." Janet Tavakoli, a Chicago consultant who specializes in CDOs, said Norma "is a tangled hairball of risk." When it came to market in March 2007, "any savvy investor would have thrown this...in the trash bin."[72][73]
According to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, no securities became "more pervasive -- or [did] more damage than collateralized debt obligations" to create the Great Recession.[12]
Gretchen Morgenson described the securities as "a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages [that] created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders."

CDOs prolonged the mania, vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like Citigroup and the American International Group." ...[74]

In the first quarter of 2008 alone, credit rating agencies announced 4,485 downgrades of CDOs.[67] At least some analysts complained the agencies over-relied on computer models with imprecise inputs, failed to account adequately for large risks (like a nationwide collapse of housing values), and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up CDOs would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated, and when one mortgage defaulted, many did, affected by the same financial events.[32][75]
They were strongly criticized by economist Joseph Stiglitz, among others. Stiglitz considered the agencies "one of the key culprits" of the crisis that "performed that alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies."[76][77] According to Morgenson, the agencies had pretended to transform "dross into gold."[44]

"As usual, the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of Wall Street's rocket scientists. Fitch, Moody's, and S&P paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and, not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend, accommodate, and impress the Wall Street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay. ... Their [the rating agencies] failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies' models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate."[78]

Michael Lewis also pronounced the transformation of BBB tranches into 80% triple A CDOs as "dishonest", "artificial" and the result of "fat fees" paid to rating agencies by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms.[79] However, if the collateral had been sufficient, those ratings would have been correct, according to the FDIC.
Synthetic CDOs were criticized in particular, because of the difficulties to judge (and price) the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly. That adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation.[3]
Others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lender's incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization.[80][81][82] According to economist Mark Zandi: "As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined."[21]
Zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation. "Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards."[21]

Concept[edit]
CDOs vary in structure and underlying assets, but the basic principle is the same. A CDO is a type of asset-backed security. To create a CDO, a corporate entity is constructed to hold assets as collateral backing packages of cash flows which are sold to investors.[83] A sequence in constructing a CDO is:

A special purpose entity (SPE) is designed/constructed to acquire a portfolio of underlying assets. Common underlying assets held may include mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans.
The SPE issues bonds to investors in exchange for cash, which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets. Like other ABS private label securities, the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches, each with different risk characteristics. Senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches. Losses are first borne by the equity tranches, next by the junior tranches, and finally by the senior tranches.[84]

A common analogy compares the cash flow from the CDO's portfolio of securities (say mortgage payments from mortgage-backed bonds) to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches, then equity tranches. If a large portion of the mortgages enter default, there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first.
The risk and return for a CDO investor depends both on how the tranches are defined, and on the underlying assets. In particular, the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches.[85] CDOs, like all asset-backed securities, enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors. Thus investors must understand how the risk for CDOs is calculated.
The issuer of the CDO, typically an investment bank, earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the CDO. The ability to earn substantial fees from originating CDOs, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality.
In some cases, the assets held by one CDO consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other CDOs. This explains why some CDOs became entirely worthless, as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasn't sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages (many of which defaulted) to trickle down to the equity layers.
Structures[edit]
CDO refers to several different types of products. The primary classifications are as follows:

Source of funds—cash flow vs. market value


Cash flow CDOs pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the CDO's assets. Cash flow CDOs focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio.
Market value CDOs attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets. The CDO asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the CDO's portfolio. There is greater focus on the changes in market value of the CDO's assets. Market value CDOs are longer-established, but less common than cash flow CDOs.


Motivation—arbitrage vs. balance sheet


Arbitrage transactions (cash flow and market value) attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds. The majority, 86%, of CDOs are arbitrage-motivated.[86]
Balance sheet transactions, by contrast, are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions’ desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets, to reduce their regulatory capital requirements and improve their return on risk capital. A bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheet's credit risk.


Funding—cash vs. synthetic


Cash CDOs involve a portfolio of cash assets, such as loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities or mortgage-backed securities. Ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity (known as a special purpose vehicle) issuing the CDO's tranches. The risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority. Cash CDO issuance exceeded $400 billion in 2006.
Synthetic CDOs do not own cash assets like bonds or loans. Instead, synthetic CDOs gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of credit default swaps, a derivatives instrument. (Under such a swap, the credit protection seller, the CDO, receives periodic cash payments, called premiums, in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event.) Like a cash CDO, the risk of loss on the CDO's portfolio is divided into tranches. Losses will first affect the equity tranche, next the junior tranches, and finally the senior tranche. Each tranche receives a periodic payment (the swap premium), with the junior tranches offering higher premiums.

A synthetic CDO tranche may be either funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contract) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below LIBOR. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.


Hybrid CDOs have a portfolio including both cash assets—like a cash CDOs—and swaps that give the CDO credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic CDO. A portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps. The CDO receives payments from three sources: the return from the cash assets, the GIC or reserve account investments, and the CDO premiums.


Single-tranche CDOs
The flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct Single Tranche CDOs (bespoke tranche CDOs) where the entire CDO is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors, and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models. Residual risk is delta-hedged by the dealer.


Structured Operating Companies
Unlike CDOs, which are terminating structures that typically wind-down or refinance at the end of their financing term, Structured Operating Companies are permanently capitalized variants of CDOs, with an active management team and infrastructure. They often issue term notes, commercial paper, and/or auction rate securities, depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company. Credit Derivative Products Companies (CDPC) and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIV) are examples, with CDPC taking risk synthetically and SIV with predominantly 'cash' exposure.

Taxation[edit]
The issuer of a CDO—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the United States to avoid being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its global income. These corporations must restrict their activities to avoid U.S. tax; corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the U.S. will be subject to federal taxation.[87] Foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of U.S. stock and debt securities are not. Investing, unlike trading or dealing, is not considered to be a trade or business, regardless of its volume or frequency.[88]
In addition, a safe harbor protects CDO issuers that do trade actively in securities, even though trading in securities technically is a business, provided the issuer’s activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking, lending or similar businesses.[89]
CDOs are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of CDOs which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules (such as PFIC and CFC reporting). The PFIC and CFC reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and tax reporting.
Types[edit]
A) Based on the underlying asset:

Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged bank loans.
Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged fixed income securities.
Collateralized synthetic obligations (CSOs): CDOs backed primarily by credit derivatives.
Structured finance CDOs (SFCDOs): CDOs backed primarily by structured products (such as asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities).[90]

B) Other types of CDOs by assets/collateral include:

Commercial Real Estate CDOs (CRE CDOs): backed primarily by commercial real estate assets
Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by corporate bonds
Collateralized Insurance Obligations (CIOs): backed by insurance or, more usually, reinsurance contracts
CDO-Squared: CDOs backed primarily by the tranches issued by other CDOs.[90]
CDO^n: Generic term for CDO3 (CDO cubed) and higher, where the CDO is backed by other CDOs/CDO2/CDO3. These are particularly difficult vehicles to model because of the possible repetition of exposures in the underlying CDO.

Types of collateral[edit]
The collateral for cash CDOs include:

Structured finance securities (mortgage-backed securities, home equity asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities)
Leveraged loans
Corporate bonds
Real estate investment trust (REIT) debt
Commercial real estate mortgage debt (including whole loans, B notes, and Mezzanine debt)
Emerging-market sovereign debt
Project finance debt
Trust Preferred securities

Transaction participants[edit]
Participants in a CDO transaction include investors, the underwriter, the asset manager, the trustee and collateral administrator, accountants and attorneys. Beginning in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allowed banks to also participate.
Investors[edit]
Investors—buyers of CDO—include insurance companies, mutual fund companies, unit trusts, investment trusts, commercial banks, investment banks, pension fund managers, private banking organizations, other CDOs and structured investment vehicles. Investors have different motivations for purchasing CDO securities depending on which tranche they select. At the more senior levels of debt, investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities (e.g., corporate bonds) of a similar rating. In some cases, investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing. This is true because senior tranches pay a spread above LIBOR despite their AAA-ratings. Investors also benefit from the diversification of the CDO portfolio, the expertise of the asset manager, and the credit support built into the transaction. Investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds.
Junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged, non-recourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio. Mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities. Investors include hedge funds, banks, and wealthy individuals.
Underwriter[edit]
The underwriter of a CDO is typically an investment bank, and acts as the structurer and arranger. Working with the asset management firm that selects the CDO's portfolio, the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches. This includes selecting the debt-to-equity ratio, sizing each tranche, establishing coverage and collateral quality tests, and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche.
The key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders. Such a determination requires estimating the after-default return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the CDO's rated notes. The excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive IRRs to the equityholders.
Other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle (typically a trust incorporated in the Cayman Islands) that will purchase the assets and issue the CDO's tranches. In addition, the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the post-closing trading restrictions that will be included in the CDO's transaction documents and other files.
The final step is to price the CDO (i.e., set the coupons for each debt tranche) and place the tranches with investors. The priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches (A, BBB, etc.) of the CDO. It is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche. In addition, the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the CDO, especially its more senior tranches.
According to Thomson Financial, the top underwriters before September 2008 were Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America Securities.[91] CDOs are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved. The underwriter is paid a fee when the CDO is issued.
The asset manager[edit]
The asset manager plays a key role in each CDO transaction, even after the CDO is issued. An experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the CDO's portfolio. The manager can maintain the credit quality of a CDO's portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur.
In theory, the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below, although in practice, this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade). In addition, it is now understood that the structural flaw in all asset-backed securities (originators profit from loan volume not loan quality) make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment.
The asset manager's role begins in the months before a CDO is issued, a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming CDO. This process is called warehousing.
Even by the issuance date, the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the CDO's portfolio. A "ramp-up" period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the CDO is issued. For this reason, some senior CDO notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes, allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made. When a transaction is fully ramped, its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager.
However, the asset manager's role continues even after the ramp-up period ends, albeit in a less active role. During the CDO's "reinvestment period", which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the CDO, the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities. Within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the CDO's transaction documents, the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the CDO's portfolio. The manager also has a role in the redemption of a CDO's notes by auction call.
There are approximately 300 asset managers in the marketplace. CDO Asset Managers, as with other Asset Managers, can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the CDO. Asset Managers make money by virtue of the senior fee (which is paid before any of the CDO investors are paid) and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the CDO, making CDOs a lucrative business for asset managers. These fees, together with underwriting fees, administration—approx 1.5 - 2% -- by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment, by virtue of reduced cashflow.

The trustee and collateral administrator[edit]
The trustee holds title to the assets of the CDO for the benefit of the "noteholders" (i.e., the investors). In the CDO market, the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator. In this role, the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports, performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models.[92] In contrast to the asset manager, there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace. The following institutions offer trustee services in the CDO marketplace:

Bank of New York Mellon (note: the Bank of New York Mellon acquired the corporate trust unit of JP Morgan),
BNP Paribas Securities Services (note: currently serves the European market only)
Citibank
Deutsche Bank
Equity Trust
Intertrust Group (note: until mid-2009 was known as Fortis Intertrust; Acquired ATC Capital Markets in 2013)
HSBC
Sanne Trust
State Street Corporation
US Bank (note: US Bank acquired the corporate trust unit of Wachovia in 2008 and Bank of America in September 2011, which had previously acquired LaSalle Bank in 2010, and is the current market share leader)
Wells Fargo
Wilmington Trust: Wilmington shut down their business in early 2009.

Accountants[edit]
The underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the CDO's portfolio of debt securities. This entails verifying certain attributes, such as credit rating and coupon/spread, of each collateral security. Source documents or public sources will typically be used to tie-out the collateral pool information. In addition, the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests.
The firm may also perform a cash flow tie-out in which the transaction's waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents. The yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter. On each payment date, an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders.
Attorneys[edit]
Attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents. Attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements to disclose certain information to investors. This will be circulated to investors. It is common for multiple counsels to be involved in a single deal because of the number of parties to a single CDO from asset management firms to underwriters.

(source: Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis-March 2009)
^ Other sources give an even higher proportion. In the fall of 2005 Gene Park, an executive at AIG Financial Products division found, "The percentage of subprime securities in the CDOs wasn't 10 percent -- it was 85 percent!" (source: McLean and Nocera, All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p.201)

A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS).[1] Originally developed for the corporate debt markets, over time CDOs evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgage-backed security ("MBS") markets.[2]
Like other private label securities backed by assets, a CDO can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence, based on the cash flow the CDO collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns. The CDO is "sliced" into "tranches", which "catch" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.[3] If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most "junior" tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, coupon payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk. As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as "super senior"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.[4]
Separate special purpose entities—rather than the parent investment bank—issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration, known as "CDO-squared", "CDOs of CDOs" or "synthetic CDOs".[4]
In the early 2000s, CDOs were generally diversified,[5] but by 2006–2007—when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this changed. CDO collateral became dominated not by loans, but by lower level (BBB or A) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually sub-prime mortgages,[6] and are known as a synthetic CDO. These CDOs have been called "the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain" for sub-prime mortgages,[7] and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make sub-prime loans[8] leading up to the 2007-9 subprime mortgage crisis.

Market history[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
The first CDO was issued in 1987 by bankers at now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for the also now-defunct Imperial Savings Association.[9] During the 1990s the collateral of CDOs was generally corporate and emerging market bonds and bank loans.[10] After 1998 "multi-sector" CDOs were developed by Prudential Securities,[11] but CDOs remained fairly obscure until after 2000.[12] In 2002 and 2003 CDOs had a setback when rating agencies "were forced to downgrade hundreds" of the securities,[13] but sales of CDOs grew—from $69 billion in 2000 to around $500 billion in 2006.[14] From 2004 through 2007, $1.4 trillion worth of CDOs were issued.[15]
Early CDOs were diversified, and might include everything from aircraft lease-equipment debt, manufactured housing loans, to student loans and credit card debt. The diversification of borrowers in these "multisector CDOs" was a selling point, as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted, other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected.[16] Another selling point was that CDOs offered returns that were sometimes 2-3 percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating.[16][17]
Explanations for growth[edit]

Advantages of securitization -- Depository banks had incentive to "securitize" loans they originated—often in the form of CDO securities—because this removes the loans from their books. The transfer of these loans (along with related risk) to security-buying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks' capital. This enabled them to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees.
Global demand for fixed income investments -- From 2000 to 2007 worldwide fixed income investment (i.e. investments in bonds and other conservative securities) roughly doubled in size to $70 trillion, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast, which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates.[18][19] Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage-backed security (MBS) and collateralized debt obligation (CDO), which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies.[19]
Low interest rates -- Fears of deflation, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a U.S. recession, and the U.S. trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from 2000 to 2004-5, according to Economist Mark Zandi.[20] The low yield of the safe US Treasury bonds created demand by global investors for subprime mortgage-backed CDOs with their relatively high-yields but credit ratings as high as the Treasuries. This search for yield by global investors caused many to purchase CDOs, though they lived to regret trusting the credit rating agencies' ratings.[21]
Pricing models -- Gaussian copula models, introduced in 2001 by David X. Li, allowed for the rapid pricing of CDOs.[22][23]

Main article: Subprime mortgage crisis
See also: Subprime lending and Bear Stearns subprime mortgage hedge fund crisis
Around 2005, as the CDO market continued to grow, subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral. By 2004, mortgage-backed securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in CDOs.[7][25][26][27][28][29] According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, "the CDO became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain",[7] promoting an increase in demand for mortgage-backed securities without which lenders would have "had less reason to push so hard to make" non-prime loans.[8] CDOs not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgage-backed securities, they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities.[7] Between 2003 and 2007, Wall Street issued almost $700 billion in CDOs that included mortgage-backed securities as collateral.[7] Despite this loss of diversification, CDO tranches were given the same proportion of high ratings by rating agencies[30] on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so "uncorrelated"[31]—though those ratings were lowered after mortgage holders began to default.[32][33]
The rise of "ratings arbitrage"—i.e. pooling low-rated tranches to make CDOs—helped push sales of CDOs to about $500 billion in 2006,[14] with a global CDO market of over USD $1.5 trillion.[34] CDO was the fastest-growing sector of the structured finance market between 2003 and 2006; the number of CDO tranches issued in 2006 (9,278) was almost twice the number of tranches issued in 2005 (4,706).[35]
CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course.[36]
Explanations for growth[edit]
Subprime mortgages had been financed by mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Like CDOs, MBSs were structured into tranches, but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower level/lower-rated "mezzanine" tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from AA to BB.

Because most traditional mortgage investors are risk-averse, either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices, they are interested in buying the higher-rated segments of the loan stack; as a result, those slices are easiest to sell. The more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile. The way mortgage securities are structured, if you cannot find buyers for the lower-rated slices, the rest of the pool cannot be sold.[37][38]

To deal with the problem investment bankers "recycled" the mezzanine tranches, selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—CDOs. Though the pool that made up the CDO collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches, most of the tranches (70[39] to 80%[40][41]) of the CDO were rated not BBB, A-, etc., but triple A. The minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other CDOs, concentrating the lower rated tranches still further. (see chart on "The Theory of How the Financial System Created AAA-rated Assets out of Subprime Mortgages")
As one journalist (Gretchen Morgenson) put it, CDOs became "the perfect dumping ground for the low-rated slices Wall Street couldn't sell on its own."[37]
Other factors explaining the popularity of CDOs include:

Growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued.[18][19] A "global savings glut"[42] leading to "large capital inflows" from abroad helped finance the housing boom, keeping down US mortgage rates, even after the Federal Reserve Bank had raised interest rates to cool off the economy.[43]
Supply generated by "hefty" fees the CDO industry earned. According to "one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in CDOs", as much "as 40 to 50 percent" of the cash flow generated by the assets in a CDO went to "pay the bankers, the CDO manager, the rating agencies, and others who took out fees."[13] Rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the CDO tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by CDO issuers—earned extraordinary profits. Moody's Investors Service, one of the two biggest rating agencies, could earn "as much as $250,000 to rate a mortgage pool with $350 million in assets, versus the $50,000 in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size." In 2006, revenues from Moody's structured finance division "accounted for fully 44%" of all Moody's sales.[44][45] Moody's operating margins were "consistently over 50%, making it one of the most profitable companies in existence"—more profitable in terms of margins than Exxon Mobil or Microsoft.[46] Between the time Moody's was spun off as a public company and February 2007, its stock rose 340%.[46][47]
Trust in rating agencies. CDO managers "didn't always have to disclose what the securities contained" because the contents of the CDO were subject to change. But this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities. Investors "weren't so much buying a security. They were buying a triple-A rating," according to business journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera.[13]
Financial innovations, such as credit default swaps and synthetic CDO. Credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premium-like payments, making CDOs appear "to be virtually risk-free" to investors.[48] Synthetic CDOs were cheaper and easier to create than original "cash" CDOs. Synthetics "referenced" cash CDOs, replacing interest payments from MBS tranches with premium-like payments from credit default swaps. Rather than providing funding for housing, synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default.[49] If the CDO did not perform per contractual requirements, one counterparty (typically a large investment bank or hedge fund) had to pay another.[50] As underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated, subprime mortgages became less abundant. Synthetic CDOs began to fill in for the original cash CDOs. Because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original, the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically.

Crash[edit]




More than half of the highest-rated (Aaa) CDOs were "impaired" (losing principal or downgraded to junk status), compared to a small fraction of similarly rated Subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities. (source: Financial Crisis Inquiry Report[51])


In the summer of 2006, the Case-Shiller index of house prices peaked.[52] In California home prices had more than doubled since 2000[53] and median house prices in Los Angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income. To entice the low and moderate income to sign up for mortgages, down payments, income documentation were often dispensed with and interest and principal payments were often deferred upon request.[54] Journalist Michael Lewis gave as an example of unsustainable underwriting practices a loan in Bakersfield, California, where "a Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 and no English was lent every penny he needed to buy a house of $724,000".[54] As two-year "teaser" mortgage rates - common with those that made home purchases like this possible - expired, mortgage payments skyrocketed. Refinancing to lower mortgage payment was no longer available since it depended on rising home prices.[55] Mezzanine tranches started to lose value in 2007, by mid year AA tranches were worth only 70 cents on the dollar. By October triple-A tranches had started to fall.[56] Regional diversification notwithstanding, the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated.[10]
Big CDO arrangers like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and UBS experienced some of the biggest losses, as did financial guaranteers such as AIG, Ambac, MBIA.[10]
An early indicator of the crisis came in July 2007 when rating agencies made unprecedented mass downgrades of mortgage-related securities[57] (by the end of 2008 91% of CDO securities were downgraded[58]), and two highly leveraged Bear Stearns hedge funds holding MBSs and CDOs collapsed. Investors were informed by Bear Stearns that they would get little if any of their money back.[59][60]
In October and November the CEOs of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup resigned after reporting multibillion-dollar losses and CDO downgrades.[61][62][63] As the global market for CDOs dried up[64][65] the new issue pipeline for CDOs slowed significantly,[66] and what CDO issuance there was usually in the form of collateralized loan obligations backed by middle-market or leveraged bank loans, rather than home mortgage ABS.[67] The CDO collapse hurt mortgage credit available to homeowners since the bigger MBS market depended on CDO purchases of mezzanine tranches.[68][69]
While non-prime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages, CDOs were especially hard hit. More than half -- $300 billion worth—of tranches issued in 2005, 2006, and 2007 rated most safe—triple A -- by rating agencies, were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by 2009.[51] In comparison, only small fractions of triple A tranches of Alt-A or subprime mortgage-backed securities suffered the same fate. (see Impaired Securities chart)
Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) also made up over half ($542 billion) of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from 2007 to early 2009.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Prior to the crisis, a few academics, analysts and investors such as Warren Buffett (who famously disparaged CDOs and other derivatives as "financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal"[70]), and the IMF's former chief economist Raghuram Rajan[71] warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification, CDOs and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widely.[citation needed]
During and after the crisis, criticism of the CDO market was more vocal. According to the radio documentary "Giant Pool of Money", it was the strong demand for MBS and CDO, that drove down home lending standards. Mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted.[19]
The head of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, Patrick Parkinson, termed "the whole concept of ABS CDOs", an "abomination".[10]
In December 2007, journalists Carrick Mollenkamp and Serena Ng wrote of a CDO called Norma created by Merrill Lynch at the behest of Illinois hedge fund, Magnetar. It was a tailor-made bet on subprime mortgages that went "too far." Janet Tavakoli, a Chicago consultant who specializes in CDOs, said Norma "is a tangled hairball of risk." When it came to market in March 2007, "any savvy investor would have thrown this...in the trash bin."[72][73]
According to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, no securities became "more pervasive -- or [did] more damage than collateralized debt obligations" to create the Great Recession.[12]
Gretchen Morgenson described the securities as "a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages [that] created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders."

CDOs prolonged the mania, vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like Citigroup and the American International Group." ...[74]

In the first quarter of 2008 alone, credit rating agencies announced 4,485 downgrades of CDOs.[67] At least some analysts complained the agencies over-relied on computer models with imprecise inputs, failed to account adequately for large risks (like a nationwide collapse of housing values), and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up CDOs would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated, and when one mortgage defaulted, many did, affected by the same financial events.[32][75]
They were strongly criticized by economist Joseph Stiglitz, among others. Stiglitz considered the agencies "one of the key culprits" of the crisis that "performed that alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies."[76][77] According to Morgenson, the agencies had pretended to transform "dross into gold."[44]

"As usual, the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of Wall Street's rocket scientists. Fitch, Moody's, and S&P paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and, not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend, accommodate, and impress the Wall Street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay. ... Their [the rating agencies] failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies' models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate."[78]

Michael Lewis also pronounced the transformation of BBB tranches into 80% triple A CDOs as "dishonest", "artificial" and the result of "fat fees" paid to rating agencies by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms.[79] However, if the collateral had been sufficient, those ratings would have been correct, according to the FDIC.
Synthetic CDOs were criticized in particular, because of the difficulties to judge (and price) the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly. That adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation.[3]
Others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lender's incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization.[80][81][82] According to economist Mark Zandi: "As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined."[21]
Zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation. "Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards."[21]
Concept, structures, varieties[edit]

Concept[edit]
CDOs vary in structure and underlying assets, but the basic principle is the same. A CDO is a type of asset-backed security. To create a CDO, a corporate entity is constructed to hold assets as collateral backing packages of cash flows which are sold to investors.[83] A sequence in constructing a CDO is:

A special purpose entity (SPE) is designed/constructed to acquire a portfolio of underlying assets. Common underlying assets held may include mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans.
The SPE issues bonds to investors in exchange for cash, which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets. Like other ABS private label securities, the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches, each with different risk characteristics. Senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches. Losses are first borne by the equity tranches, next by the junior tranches, and finally by the senior tranches.[84]

A common analogy compares the cash flow from the CDO's portfolio of securities (say mortgage payments from mortgage-backed bonds) to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches, then equity tranches. If a large portion of the mortgages enter default, there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first.
The risk and return for a CDO investor depends both on how the tranches are defined, and on the underlying assets. In particular, the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches.[85] CDOs, like all asset-backed securities, enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors. Thus investors must understand how the risk for CDOs is calculated.
The issuer of the CDO, typically an investment bank, earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the CDO. The ability to earn substantial fees from originating CDOs, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality.
In some cases, the assets held by one CDO consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other CDOs. This explains why some CDOs became entirely worthless, as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasn't sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages (many of which defaulted) to trickle down to the equity layers.
Structures[edit]
CDO refers to several different types of products. The primary classifications are as follows:

Source of funds—cash flow vs. market value


Cash flow CDOs pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the CDO's assets. Cash flow CDOs focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio.
Market value CDOs attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets. The CDO asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the CDO's portfolio. There is greater focus on the changes in market value of the CDO's assets. Market value CDOs are longer-established, but less common than cash flow CDOs.


Motivation—arbitrage vs. balance sheet


Arbitrage transactions (cash flow and market value) attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds. The majority, 86%, of CDOs are arbitrage-motivated.[86]
Balance sheet transactions, by contrast, are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions’ desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets, to reduce their regulatory capital requirements and improve their return on risk capital. A bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheet's credit risk.


Funding—cash vs. synthetic


Cash CDOs involve a portfolio of cash assets, such as loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities or mortgage-backed securities. Ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity (known as a special purpose vehicle) issuing the CDO's tranches. The risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority. Cash CDO issuance exceeded $400 billion in 2006.
Synthetic CDOs do not own cash assets like bonds or loans. Instead, synthetic CDOs gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of credit default swaps, a derivatives instrument. (Under such a swap, the credit protection seller, the CDO, receives periodic cash payments, called premiums, in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event.) Like a cash CDO, the risk of loss on the CDO's portfolio is divided into tranches. Losses will first affect the equity tranche, next the junior tranches, and finally the senior tranche. Each tranche receives a periodic payment (the swap premium), with the junior tranches offering higher premiums.

A synthetic CDO tranche may be either funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contract) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below LIBOR. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.


Hybrid CDOs have a portfolio including both cash assets—like a cash CDOs—and swaps that give the CDO credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic CDO. A portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps. The CDO receives payments from three sources: the return from the cash assets, the GIC or reserve account investments, and the CDO premiums.


Single-tranche CDOs
The flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct Single Tranche CDOs (bespoke tranche CDOs) where the entire CDO is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors, and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models. Residual risk is delta-hedged by the dealer.


Structured Operating Companies
Unlike CDOs, which are terminating structures that typically wind-down or refinance at the end of their financing term, Structured Operating Companies are permanently capitalized variants of CDOs, with an active management team and infrastructure. They often issue term notes, commercial paper, and/or auction rate securities, depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company. Credit Derivative Products Companies (CDPC) and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIV) are examples, with CDPC taking risk synthetically and SIV with predominantly 'cash' exposure.

Taxation[edit]
The issuer of a CDO—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the United States to avoid being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its global income. These corporations must restrict their activities to avoid U.S. tax; corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the U.S. will be subject to federal taxation.[87] Foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of U.S. stock and debt securities are not. Investing, unlike trading or dealing, is not considered to be a trade or business, regardless of its volume or frequency.[88]
In addition, a safe harbor protects CDO issuers that do trade actively in securities, even though trading in securities technically is a business, provided the issuer’s activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking, lending or similar businesses.[89]
CDOs are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of CDOs which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules (such as PFIC and CFC reporting). The PFIC and CFC reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and tax reporting.
Types[edit]
A) Based on the underlying asset:

Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged bank loans.
Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged fixed income securities.
Collateralized synthetic obligations (CSOs): CDOs backed primarily by credit derivatives.
Structured finance CDOs (SFCDOs): CDOs backed primarily by structured products (such as asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities).[90]

B) Other types of CDOs by assets/collateral include:

Commercial Real Estate CDOs (CRE CDOs): backed primarily by commercial real estate assets
Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by corporate bonds
Collateralized Insurance Obligations (CIOs): backed by insurance or, more usually, reinsurance contracts
CDO-Squared: CDOs backed primarily by the tranches issued by other CDOs.[90]
CDO^n: Generic term for CDO3 (CDO cubed) and higher, where the CDO is backed by other CDOs/CDO2/CDO3. These are particularly difficult vehicles to model because of the possible repetition of exposures in the underlying CDO.

Types of collateral[edit]
The collateral for cash CDOs include:

Structured finance securities (mortgage-backed securities, home equity asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities)
Leveraged loans
Corporate bonds
Real estate investment trust (REIT) debt
Commercial real estate mortgage debt (including whole loans, B notes, and Mezzanine debt)
Emerging-market sovereign debt
Project finance debt
Trust Preferred securities

Transaction participants[edit]
Participants in a CDO transaction include investors, the underwriter, the asset manager, the trustee and collateral administrator, accountants and attorneys. Beginning in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allowed banks to also participate.
Investors[edit]
Investors—buyers of CDO—include insurance companies, mutual fund companies, unit trusts, investment trusts, commercial banks, investment banks, pension fund managers, private banking organizations, other CDOs and structured investment vehicles. Investors have different motivations for purchasing CDO securities depending on which tranche they select. At the more senior levels of debt, investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities (e.g., corporate bonds) of a similar rating. In some cases, investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing. This is true because senior tranches pay a spread above LIBOR despite their AAA-ratings. Investors also benefit from the diversification of the CDO portfolio, the expertise of the asset manager, and the credit support built into the transaction. Investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds.
Junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged, non-recourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio. Mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities. Investors include hedge funds, banks, and wealthy individuals.
Underwriter[edit]
The underwriter of a CDO is typically an investment bank, and acts as the structurer and arranger. Working with the asset management firm that selects the CDO's portfolio, the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches. This includes selecting the debt-to-equity ratio, sizing each tranche, establishing coverage and collateral quality tests, and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche.
The key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders. Such a determination requires estimating the after-default return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the CDO's rated notes. The excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive IRRs to the equityholders.
Other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle (typically a trust incorporated in the Cayman Islands) that will purchase the assets and issue the CDO's tranches. In addition, the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the post-closing trading restrictions that will be included in the CDO's transaction documents and other files.
The final step is to price the CDO (i.e., set the coupons for each debt tranche) and place the tranches with investors. The priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches (A, BBB, etc.) of the CDO. It is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche. In addition, the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the CDO, especially its more senior tranches.
According to Thomson Financial, the top underwriters before September 2008 were Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America Securities.[91] CDOs are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved. The underwriter is paid a fee when the CDO is issued.
The asset manager[edit]
The asset manager plays a key role in each CDO transaction, even after the CDO is issued. An experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the CDO's portfolio. The manager can maintain the credit quality of a CDO's portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur.
In theory, the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below, although in practice, this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade). In addition, it is now understood that the structural flaw in all asset-backed securities (originators profit from loan volume not loan quality) make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment.
The asset manager's role begins in the months before a CDO is issued, a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming CDO. This process is called warehousing.
Even by the issuance date, the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the CDO's portfolio. A "ramp-up" period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the CDO is issued. For this reason, some senior CDO notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes, allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made. When a transaction is fully ramped, its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager.
However, the asset manager's role continues even after the ramp-up period ends, albeit in a less active role. During the CDO's "reinvestment period", which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the CDO, the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities. Within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the CDO's transaction documents, the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the CDO's portfolio. The manager also has a role in the redemption of a CDO's notes by auction call.
There are approximately 300 asset managers in the marketplace. CDO Asset Managers, as with other Asset Managers, can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the CDO. Asset Managers make money by virtue of the senior fee (which is paid before any of the CDO investors are paid) and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the CDO, making CDOs a lucrative business for asset managers. These fees, together with underwriting fees, administration—approx 1.5 - 2% -- by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment, by virtue of reduced cashflow.

The trustee and collateral administrator[edit]
The trustee holds title to the assets of the CDO for the benefit of the "noteholders" (i.e., the investors). In the CDO market, the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator. In this role, the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports, performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models.[92] In contrast to the asset manager, there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace. The following institutions offer trustee services in the CDO marketplace:

Bank of New York Mellon (note: the Bank of New York Mellon acquired the corporate trust unit of JP Morgan),
BNP Paribas Securities Services (note: currently serves the European market only)
Citibank
Deutsche Bank
Equity Trust
Intertrust Group (note: until mid-2009 was known as Fortis Intertrust; Acquired ATC Capital Markets in 2013)
HSBC
Sanne Trust
State Street Corporation
US Bank (note: US Bank acquired the corporate trust unit of Wachovia in 2008 and Bank of America in September 2011, which had previously acquired LaSalle Bank in 2010, and is the current market share leader)
Wells Fargo
Wilmington Trust: Wilmington shut down their business in early 2009.

Accountants[edit]
The underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the CDO's portfolio of debt securities. This entails verifying certain attributes, such as credit rating and coupon/spread, of each collateral security. Source documents or public sources will typically be used to tie-out the collateral pool information. In addition, the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests.
The firm may also perform a cash flow tie-out in which the transaction's waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents. The yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter. On each payment date, an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders.
Attorneys[edit]
Attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents. Attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements to disclose certain information to investors. This will be circulated to investors. It is common for multiple counsels to be involved in a single deal because of the number of parties to a single CDO from asset management firms to underwriters.

^ An "asset-backed security" is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets—including collateralized debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities (Example: "A capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs".

(source: Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis-March 2009)
^ Other sources give an even higher proportion. In the fall of 2005 Gene Park, an executive at AIG Financial Products division found, "The percentage of subprime securities in the CDOs wasn't 10 percent -- it was 85 percent!" (source: McLean and Nocera, All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p.201)

^ Still another source (The Big Short, Michael Lewis, p.71) says:
"The `consumer loans` piles that Wall Street firms, led by Goldman Sachs, asked AIG FP to insure went from being 2% subprime mortgages to being 95% subprime mortgages. In a matter of months, AIG-FP, in effect, bought $50 billion in triple-B-rated subprime mortgage bonds by insuring them against default. And yet no one said anything about it ..."
^ In 2007, 47% of CDOs were backed by structured products, such as mortgages; 45% of CDOs were backed by loans, and only less than 10% of CDOs were backed by fixed income securities. (source: Securitization rankings of bookrunners, issuers, etc.

This is what Goldman Sachs had cleverly done. it was absurd. The 100 buildings occupied the same floodplain; in the event of flood, the ground floors of all of them were equally exposed.

A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS).[1] Originally developed for the corporate debt markets, over time CDOs evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgage-backed security ("MBS") markets.[2]
Like other private label securities backed by assets, a CDO can be thought of as a promise to pay investors in a prescribed sequence, based on the cash flow the CDO collects from the pool of bonds or other assets it owns. The CDO is "sliced" into "tranches", which "catch" the cash flow of interest and principal payments in sequence based on seniority.[3] If some loans default and the cash collected by the CDO is insufficient to pay all of its investors, those in the lowest, most "junior" tranches suffer losses first. The last to lose payment from default are the safest, most senior tranches. Consequently, coupon payments (and interest rates) vary by tranche with the safest/most senior tranches receiving the lowest rates and the lowest tranches receiving the highest rates to compensate for higher default risk. As an example, a CDO might issue the following tranches in order of safeness: Senior AAA (sometimes known as "super senior"); Junior AAA; AA; A; BBB; Residual.[4]
Separate special purpose entities—rather than the parent investment bank—issue the CDOs and pay interest to investors. As CDOs developed, some sponsors repackaged tranches into yet another iteration, known as "CDO-squared", "CDOs of CDOs" or "synthetic CDOs".[4]
In the early 2000s, CDOs were generally diversified,[5] but by 2006–2007—when the CDO market grew to hundreds of billions of dollars—this changed. CDO collateral became dominated not by loans, but by lower level (BBB or A) tranches recycled from other asset-backed securities, whose assets were usually sub-prime mortgages,[6] and are known as a synthetic CDO. These CDOs have been called "the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain" for sub-prime mortgages,[7] and are credited with giving lenders greater incentive to make sub-prime loans[8] leading up to the 2007-9 subprime mortgage crisis.

Market history[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
The first CDO was issued in 1987 by bankers at now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for the also now-defunct Imperial Savings Association.[9] During the 1990s the collateral of CDOs was generally corporate and emerging market bonds and bank loans.[10] After 1998 "multi-sector" CDOs were developed by Prudential Securities,[11] but CDOs remained fairly obscure until after 2000.[12] In 2002 and 2003 CDOs had a setback when rating agencies "were forced to downgrade hundreds" of the securities,[13] but sales of CDOs grew—from $69 billion in 2000 to around $500 billion in 2006.[14] From 2004 through 2007, $1.4 trillion worth of CDOs were issued.[15]
Early CDOs were diversified, and might include everything from aircraft lease-equipment debt, manufactured housing loans, to student loans and credit card debt. The diversification of borrowers in these "multisector CDOs" was a selling point, as it meant that if there was a downturn in one industry like aircraft manufacturing and their loans defaulted, other industries like manufactured housing might be unaffected.[16] Another selling point was that CDOs offered returns that were sometimes 2-3 percentage points higher than corporate bonds with the same credit rating.[16][17]
Explanations for growth[edit]

Advantages of securitization -- Depository banks had incentive to "securitize" loans they originated—often in the form of CDO securities—because this removes the loans from their books. The transfer of these loans (along with related risk) to security-buying investors in return for cash replenishes the banks' capital. This enabled them to remain in compliance with capital requirement laws while lending again and generating additional origination fees.
Global demand for fixed income investments -- From 2000 to 2007 worldwide fixed income investment (i.e. investments in bonds and other conservative securities) roughly doubled in size to $70 trillion, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast, which bid up bond prices and drove down interest rates.[18][19] Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with financial innovation such as the mortgage-backed security (MBS) and collateralized debt obligation (CDO), which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies.[19]
Low interest rates -- Fears of deflation, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a U.S. recession, and the U.S. trade deficit kept interest rates low globally from 2000 to 2004-5, according to Economist Mark Zandi.[20] The low yield of the safe US Treasury bonds created demand by global investors for subprime mortgage-backed CDOs with their relatively high-yields but credit ratings as high as the Treasuries. This search for yield by global investors caused many to purchase CDOs, though they lived to regret trusting the credit rating agencies' ratings.[21]
Pricing models -- Gaussian copula models, introduced in 2001 by David X. Li, allowed for the rapid pricing of CDOs.[22][23]

Main article: Subprime mortgage crisis
See also: Subprime lending and Bear Stearns subprime mortgage hedge fund crisis
Around 2005, as the CDO market continued to grow, subprime mortgages began to replace the diversified consumer loans as collateral. By 2004, mortgage-backed securities accounted for more than half of the collateral in CDOs.[7][25][26][27][28][29] According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, "the CDO became the engine that powered the mortgage supply chain",[7] promoting an increase in demand for mortgage-backed securities without which lenders would have "had less reason to push so hard to make" non-prime loans.[8] CDOs not only bought crucial tranches of subprime mortgage-backed securities, they provided cash for the initial funding of the securities.[7] Between 2003 and 2007, Wall Street issued almost $700 billion in CDOs that included mortgage-backed securities as collateral.[7] Despite this loss of diversification, CDO tranches were given the same proportion of high ratings by rating agencies[30] on the grounds that mortgages were diversified by region and so "uncorrelated"[31]—though those ratings were lowered after mortgage holders began to default.[32][33]
The rise of "ratings arbitrage"—i.e. pooling low-rated tranches to make CDOs—helped push sales of CDOs to about $500 billion in 2006,[14] with a global CDO market of over USD $1.5 trillion.[34] CDO was the fastest-growing sector of the structured finance market between 2003 and 2006; the number of CDO tranches issued in 2006 (9,278) was almost twice the number of tranches issued in 2005 (4,706).[35]
CDOs, like mortgage-backed securities, were financed with debt, enhancing their profits but also enhancing losses if the market reversed course.[36]
Explanations for growth[edit]
Subprime mortgages had been financed by mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Like CDOs, MBSs were structured into tranches, but issuers of the securities had difficulty selling the more lower level/lower-rated "mezzanine" tranches—the tranches rated somewhere from AA to BB.

Because most traditional mortgage investors are risk-averse, either because of the restrictions of their investment charters or business practices, they are interested in buying the higher-rated segments of the loan stack; as a result, those slices are easiest to sell. The more challenging task is finding buyers for the riskier pieces of at the bottom of the pile. The way mortgage securities are structured, if you cannot find buyers for the lower-rated slices, the rest of the pool cannot be sold.[37][38]

To deal with the problem investment bankers "recycled" the mezzanine tranches, selling them to underwriters making more structured securities—CDOs. Though the pool that made up the CDO collateral might be overwhelmingly mezzanine tranches, most of the tranches (70[39] to 80%[40][41]) of the CDO were rated not BBB, A-, etc., but triple A. The minority of the tranches that were mezzanine were often bought up by other CDOs, concentrating the lower rated tranches still further. (see chart on "The Theory of How the Financial System Created AAA-rated Assets out of Subprime Mortgages")
As one journalist (Gretchen Morgenson) put it, CDOs became "the perfect dumping ground for the low-rated slices Wall Street couldn't sell on its own."[37]
Other factors explaining the popularity of CDOs include:

Growing demand for fixed income investments that started earlier in the decade continued.[18][19] A "global savings glut"[42] leading to "large capital inflows" from abroad helped finance the housing boom, keeping down US mortgage rates, even after the Federal Reserve Bank had raised interest rates to cool off the economy.[43]
Supply generated by "hefty" fees the CDO industry earned. According to "one hedge fund manager who became a big investor in CDOs", as much "as 40 to 50 percent" of the cash flow generated by the assets in a CDO went to "pay the bankers, the CDO manager, the rating agencies, and others who took out fees."[13] Rating agencies in particular—whose high ratings of the CDO tranches were crucial to the industry and who were paid by CDO issuers—earned extraordinary profits. Moody's Investors Service, one of the two biggest rating agencies, could earn "as much as $250,000 to rate a mortgage pool with $350 million in assets, versus the $50,000 in fees generated when rating a municipal bond of a similar size." In 2006, revenues from Moody's structured finance division "accounted for fully 44%" of all Moody's sales.[44][45] Moody's operating margins were "consistently over 50%, making it one of the most profitable companies in existence"—more profitable in terms of margins than Exxon Mobil or Microsoft.[46] Between the time Moody's was spun off as a public company and February 2007, its stock rose 340%.[46][47]
Trust in rating agencies. CDO managers "didn't always have to disclose what the securities contained" because the contents of the CDO were subject to change. But this lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities. Investors "weren't so much buying a security. They were buying a triple-A rating," according to business journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera.[13]
Financial innovations, such as credit default swaps and synthetic CDO. Credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against the possibility of losses in the value of tranches from default in exchange for premium-like payments, making CDOs appear "to be virtually risk-free" to investors.[48] Synthetic CDOs were cheaper and easier to create than original "cash" CDOs. Synthetics "referenced" cash CDOs, replacing interest payments from MBS tranches with premium-like payments from credit default swaps. Rather than providing funding for housing, synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default.[49] If the CDO did not perform per contractual requirements, one counterparty (typically a large investment bank or hedge fund) had to pay another.[50] As underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated, subprime mortgages became less abundant. Synthetic CDOs began to fill in for the original cash CDOs. Because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original, the amount of money that moved among market participants increased dramatically.

Crash[edit]




More than half of the highest-rated (Aaa) CDOs were "impaired" (losing principal or downgraded to junk status), compared to a small fraction of similarly rated Subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities. (source: Financial Crisis Inquiry Report[51])


In the summer of 2006, the Case-Shiller index of house prices peaked.[52] In California home prices had more than doubled since 2000[53] and median house prices in Los Angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income. To entice the low and moderate income to sign up for mortgages, down payments, income documentation were often dispensed with and interest and principal payments were often deferred upon request.[54] Journalist Michael Lewis gave as an example of unsustainable underwriting practices a loan in Bakersfield, California, where "a Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 and no English was lent every penny he needed to buy a house of $724,000".[54] As two-year "teaser" mortgage rates - common with those that made home purchases like this possible - expired, mortgage payments skyrocketed. Refinancing to lower mortgage payment was no longer available since it depended on rising home prices.[55] Mezzanine tranches started to lose value in 2007, by mid year AA tranches were worth only 70 cents on the dollar. By October triple-A tranches had started to fall.[56] Regional diversification notwithstanding, the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated.[10]
Big CDO arrangers like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and UBS experienced some of the biggest losses, as did financial guaranteers such as AIG, Ambac, MBIA.[10]
An early indicator of the crisis came in July 2007 when rating agencies made unprecedented mass downgrades of mortgage-related securities[57] (by the end of 2008 91% of CDO securities were downgraded[58]), and two highly leveraged Bear Stearns hedge funds holding MBSs and CDOs collapsed. Investors were informed by Bear Stearns that they would get little if any of their money back.[59][60]
In October and November the CEOs of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup resigned after reporting multibillion-dollar losses and CDO downgrades.[61][62][63] As the global market for CDOs dried up[64][65] the new issue pipeline for CDOs slowed significantly,[66] and what CDO issuance there was usually in the form of collateralized loan obligations backed by middle-market or leveraged bank loans, rather than home mortgage ABS.[67] The CDO collapse hurt mortgage credit available to homeowners since the bigger MBS market depended on CDO purchases of mezzanine tranches.[68][69]
While non-prime mortgage defaults affected all securities backed by mortgages, CDOs were especially hard hit. More than half -- $300 billion worth—of tranches issued in 2005, 2006, and 2007 rated most safe—triple A -- by rating agencies, were either downgraded to junk status or lost principal by 2009.[51] In comparison, only small fractions of triple A tranches of Alt-A or subprime mortgage-backed securities suffered the same fate. (see Impaired Securities chart)
Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) also made up over half ($542 billion) of the nearly trillion dollars in losses suffered by financial institutions from 2007 to early 2009.[32]
Criticism[edit]
Prior to the crisis, a few academics, analysts and investors such as Warren Buffett (who famously disparaged CDOs and other derivatives as "financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal"[70]), and the IMF's former chief economist Raghuram Rajan[71] warned that rather than reducing risk through diversification, CDOs and other derivatives spread risk and uncertainty about the value of the underlying assets more widely.[citation needed]
During and after the crisis, criticism of the CDO market was more vocal. According to the radio documentary "Giant Pool of Money", it was the strong demand for MBS and CDO, that drove down home lending standards. Mortgages were needed for collateral and by approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted.[19]
The head of banking supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve, Patrick Parkinson, termed "the whole concept of ABS CDOs", an "abomination".[10]
In December 2007, journalists Carrick Mollenkamp and Serena Ng wrote of a CDO called Norma created by Merrill Lynch at the behest of Illinois hedge fund, Magnetar. It was a tailor-made bet on subprime mortgages that went "too far." Janet Tavakoli, a Chicago consultant who specializes in CDOs, said Norma "is a tangled hairball of risk." When it came to market in March 2007, "any savvy investor would have thrown this...in the trash bin."[72][73]
According to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera, no securities became "more pervasive -- or [did] more damage than collateralized debt obligations" to create the Great Recession.[12]
Gretchen Morgenson described the securities as "a sort of secret refuse heap for toxic mortgages [that] created even more demand for bad loans from wanton lenders."

CDOs prolonged the mania, vastly amplifying the losses that investors would suffer and ballooning the amounts of taxpayer money that would be required to rescue companies like Citigroup and the American International Group." ...[74]

In the first quarter of 2008 alone, credit rating agencies announced 4,485 downgrades of CDOs.[67] At least some analysts complained the agencies over-relied on computer models with imprecise inputs, failed to account adequately for large risks (like a nationwide collapse of housing values), and assumed the risk of the low rated tranches that made up CDOs would be diluted when in fact the mortgage risks were highly correlated, and when one mortgage defaulted, many did, affected by the same financial events.[32][75]
They were strongly criticized by economist Joseph Stiglitz, among others. Stiglitz considered the agencies "one of the key culprits" of the crisis that "performed that alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the ratings agencies."[76][77] According to Morgenson, the agencies had pretended to transform "dross into gold."[44]

"As usual, the ratings agencies were chronically behind on developments in the financial markets and they could barely keep up with the new instruments springing from the brains of Wall Street's rocket scientists. Fitch, Moody's, and S&P paid their analysts far less than the big brokerage firms did and, not surprisingly wound up employing people who were often looking to befriend, accommodate, and impress the Wall Street clients in hopes of getting hired by them for a multiple increase in pay. ... Their [the rating agencies] failure to recognize that mortgage underwriting standards had decayed or to account for the possibility that real estate prices could decline completely undermined the ratings agencies' models and undercut their ability to estimate losses that these securities might generate."[78]

Michael Lewis also pronounced the transformation of BBB tranches into 80% triple A CDOs as "dishonest", "artificial" and the result of "fat fees" paid to rating agencies by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms.[79] However, if the collateral had been sufficient, those ratings would have been correct, according to the FDIC.
Synthetic CDOs were criticized in particular, because of the difficulties to judge (and price) the risk inherent in that kind of securities correctly. That adverse effect roots in the pooling and tranching activities on every level of the derivation.[3]
Others pointed out the risk of undoing the connection between borrowers and lenders—removing the lender's incentive to only pick borrowers who were creditworthy—inherent in all securitization.[80][81][82] According to economist Mark Zandi: "As shaky mortgages were combined, diluting any problems into a larger pool, the incentive for responsibility was undermined."[21]
Zandi and others also criticized lack of regulation. "Finance companies weren't subject to the same regulatory oversight as banks. Taxpayers weren't on the hook if they went belly up [pre-crisis], only their shareholders and other creditors were. Finance companies thus had little to discourage them from growing as aggressively as possible, even if that meant lowering or winking at traditional lending standards."[21]

Concept[edit]
CDOs vary in structure and underlying assets, but the basic principle is the same. A CDO is a type of asset-backed security. To create a CDO, a corporate entity is constructed to hold assets as collateral backing packages of cash flows which are sold to investors.[83] A sequence in constructing a CDO is:

A special purpose entity (SPE) is designed/constructed to acquire a portfolio of underlying assets. Common underlying assets held may include mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate bonds and corporate loans.
The SPE issues bonds to investors in exchange for cash, which are used to purchase the portfolio of underlying assets. Like other ABS private label securities, the bonds are not uniform but issued in layers called tranches, each with different risk characteristics. Senior tranches are paid from the cash flows from the underlying assets before the junior tranches and equity tranches. Losses are first borne by the equity tranches, next by the junior tranches, and finally by the senior tranches.[84]

A common analogy compares the cash flow from the CDO's portfolio of securities (say mortgage payments from mortgage-backed bonds) to water flowing into cups of the investors where senior tranches were filled first and overflowing cash flowed to junior tranches, then equity tranches. If a large portion of the mortgages enter default, there is insufficient cash flow to fill all these cups and equity tranche investors face the losses first.
The risk and return for a CDO investor depends both on how the tranches are defined, and on the underlying assets. In particular, the investment depends on the assumptions and methods used to define the risk and return of the tranches.[85] CDOs, like all asset-backed securities, enable the originators of the underlying assets to pass credit risk to another institution or to individual investors. Thus investors must understand how the risk for CDOs is calculated.
The issuer of the CDO, typically an investment bank, earns a commission at the time of issue and earns management fees during the life of the CDO. The ability to earn substantial fees from originating CDOs, coupled with the absence of any residual liability, skews the incentives of originators in favor of loan volume rather than loan quality.
In some cases, the assets held by one CDO consisted entirely of equity layer tranches issued by other CDOs. This explains why some CDOs became entirely worthless, as the equity layer tranches were paid last in the sequence and there wasn't sufficient cash flow from the underlying subprime mortgages (many of which defaulted) to trickle down to the equity layers.
Structures[edit]
CDO refers to several different types of products. The primary classifications are as follows:

Source of funds—cash flow vs. market value


Cash flow CDOs pay interest and principal to tranche holders using the cash flows produced by the CDO's assets. Cash flow CDOs focus primarily on managing the credit quality of the underlying portfolio.
Market value CDOs attempt to enhance investor returns through the more frequent trading and profitable sale of collateral assets. The CDO asset manager seeks to realize capital gains on the assets in the CDO's portfolio. There is greater focus on the changes in market value of the CDO's assets. Market value CDOs are longer-established, but less common than cash flow CDOs.


Motivation—arbitrage vs. balance sheet


Arbitrage transactions (cash flow and market value) attempt to capture for equity investors the spread between the relatively high yielding assets and the lower yielding liabilities represented by the rated bonds. The majority, 86%, of CDOs are arbitrage-motivated.[86]
Balance sheet transactions, by contrast, are primarily motivated by the issuing institutions’ desire to remove loans and other assets from their balance sheets, to reduce their regulatory capital requirements and improve their return on risk capital. A bank may wish to offload the credit risk to reduce its balance sheet's credit risk.


Funding—cash vs. synthetic


Cash CDOs involve a portfolio of cash assets, such as loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities or mortgage-backed securities. Ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity (known as a special purpose vehicle) issuing the CDO's tranches. The risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority. Cash CDO issuance exceeded $400 billion in 2006.
Synthetic CDOs do not own cash assets like bonds or loans. Instead, synthetic CDOs gain credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of credit default swaps, a derivatives instrument. (Under such a swap, the credit protection seller, the CDO, receives periodic cash payments, called premiums, in exchange for agreeing to assume the risk of loss on a specific asset in the event that asset experiences a default or other credit event.) Like a cash CDO, the risk of loss on the CDO's portfolio is divided into tranches. Losses will first affect the equity tranche, next the junior tranches, and finally the senior tranche. Each tranche receives a periodic payment (the swap premium), with the junior tranches offering higher premiums.

A synthetic CDO tranche may be either funded or unfunded. Under the swap agreements, the CDO could have to pay up to a certain amount of money in the event of a credit event on the reference obligations in the CDO's reference portfolio. Some of this credit exposure is funded at the time of investment by the investors in funded tranches. Typically, the junior tranches that face the greatest risk of experiencing a loss have to fund at closing. Until a credit event occurs, the proceeds provided by the funded tranches are often invested in high-quality, liquid assets or placed in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Contract) account that offers a return that is a few basis points below LIBOR. The return from these investments plus the premium from the swap counterparty provide the cash flow stream to pay interest to the funded tranches. When a credit event occurs and a payout to the swap counterparty is required, the required payment is made from the GIC or reserve account that holds the liquid investments. In contrast, senior tranches are usually unfunded as the risk of loss is much lower. Unlike a cash CDO, investors in a senior tranche receive periodic payments but do not place any capital in the CDO when entering into the investment. Instead, the investors retain continuing funding exposure and may have to make a payment to the CDO in the event the portfolio's losses reach the senior tranche. Funded synthetic issuance exceeded $80 billion in 2006. From an issuance perspective, synthetic CDOs take less time to create. Cash assets do not have to be purchased and managed, and the CDO's tranches can be precisely structured.


Hybrid CDOs have a portfolio including both cash assets—like a cash CDOs—and swaps that give the CDO credit exposure to additional assets—like a synthetic CDO. A portion of the proceeds from the funded tranches is invested in cash assets and the remainder is held in reserve to cover payments that may be required under the credit default swaps. The CDO receives payments from three sources: the return from the cash assets, the GIC or reserve account investments, and the CDO premiums.


Single-tranche CDOs
The flexibility of credit default swaps is used to construct Single Tranche CDOs (bespoke tranche CDOs) where the entire CDO is structured specifically for a single or small group of investors, and the remaining tranches are never sold but held by the dealer based on valuations from internal models. Residual risk is delta-hedged by the dealer.


Structured Operating Companies
Unlike CDOs, which are terminating structures that typically wind-down or refinance at the end of their financing term, Structured Operating Companies are permanently capitalized variants of CDOs, with an active management team and infrastructure. They often issue term notes, commercial paper, and/or auction rate securities, depending upon the structural and portfolio characteristics of the company. Credit Derivative Products Companies (CDPC) and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIV) are examples, with CDPC taking risk synthetically and SIV with predominantly 'cash' exposure.

Taxation[edit]
The issuer of a CDO—usually a special purpose entity—is typically a corporation established outside the United States to avoid being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its global income. These corporations must restrict their activities to avoid U.S. tax; corporations that are deemed to engage in trade or business in the U.S. will be subject to federal taxation.[87] Foreign corporations that only invest in and hold portfolios of U.S. stock and debt securities are not. Investing, unlike trading or dealing, is not considered to be a trade or business, regardless of its volume or frequency.[88]
In addition, a safe harbor protects CDO issuers that do trade actively in securities, even though trading in securities technically is a business, provided the issuer’s activities do not cause it to be viewed as a dealer in securities or engaged in a banking, lending or similar businesses.[89]
CDOs are generally taxable as debt instruments except for the most junior class of CDOs which are treated as equity and are subject to special rules (such as PFIC and CFC reporting). The PFIC and CFC reporting is very complex and requires a specialized accountant to perform these calculations and tax reporting.
Types[edit]
A) Based on the underlying asset:

Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged bank loans.
Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by leveraged fixed income securities.
Collateralized synthetic obligations (CSOs): CDOs backed primarily by credit derivatives.
Structured finance CDOs (SFCDOs): CDOs backed primarily by structured products (such as asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities).[90]

B) Other types of CDOs by assets/collateral include:

Commercial Real Estate CDOs (CRE CDOs): backed primarily by commercial real estate assets
Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs): CDOs backed primarily by corporate bonds
Collateralized Insurance Obligations (CIOs): backed by insurance or, more usually, reinsurance contracts
CDO-Squared: CDOs backed primarily by the tranches issued by other CDOs.[90]
CDO^n: Generic term for CDO3 (CDO cubed) and higher, where the CDO is backed by other CDOs/CDO2/CDO3. These are particularly difficult vehicles to model because of the possible repetition of exposures in the underlying CDO.

Types of collateral[edit]
The collateral for cash CDOs include:

Structured finance securities (mortgage-backed securities, home equity asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities)
Leveraged loans
Corporate bonds
Real estate investment trust (REIT) debt
Commercial real estate mortgage debt (including whole loans, B notes, and Mezzanine debt)
Emerging-market sovereign debt
Project finance debt
Trust Preferred securities

Transaction participants[edit]
Participants in a CDO transaction include investors, the underwriter, the asset manager, the trustee and collateral administrator, accountants and attorneys. Beginning in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allowed banks to also participate.
Investors[edit]
Investors—buyers of CDO—include insurance companies, mutual fund companies, unit trusts, investment trusts, commercial banks, investment banks, pension fund managers, private banking organizations, other CDOs and structured investment vehicles. Investors have different motivations for purchasing CDO securities depending on which tranche they select. At the more senior levels of debt, investors are able to obtain better yields than those that are available on more traditional securities (e.g., corporate bonds) of a similar rating. In some cases, investors utilize leverage and hope to profit from the excess of the spread offered by the senior tranche and their cost of borrowing. This is true because senior tranches pay a spread above LIBOR despite their AAA-ratings. Investors also benefit from the diversification of the CDO portfolio, the expertise of the asset manager, and the credit support built into the transaction. Investors include banks and insurance companies as well as investment funds.
Junior tranche investors achieve a leveraged, non-recourse investment in the underlying diversified collateral portfolio. Mezzanine notes and equity notes offer yields that are not available in most other fixed income securities. Investors include hedge funds, banks, and wealthy individuals.
Underwriter[edit]
The underwriter of a CDO is typically an investment bank, and acts as the structurer and arranger. Working with the asset management firm that selects the CDO's portfolio, the underwriter structures debt and equity tranches. This includes selecting the debt-to-equity ratio, sizing each tranche, establishing coverage and collateral quality tests, and working with the credit rating agencies to gain the desired ratings for each debt tranche.
The key economic consideration for an underwriter that is considering bringing a new deal to market is whether the transaction can offer a sufficient return to the equity noteholders. Such a determination requires estimating the after-default return offered by the portfolio of debt securities and comparing it to the cost of funding the CDO's rated notes. The excess spread must be large enough to offer the potential of attractive IRRs to the equityholders.
Other underwriter responsibilities include working with a law firm and creating the special purpose legal vehicle (typically a trust incorporated in the Cayman Islands) that will purchase the assets and issue the CDO's tranches. In addition, the underwriter will work with the asset manager to determine the post-closing trading restrictions that will be included in the CDO's transaction documents and other files.
The final step is to price the CDO (i.e., set the coupons for each debt tranche) and place the tranches with investors. The priority in placement is finding investors for the risky equity tranche and junior debt tranches (A, BBB, etc.) of the CDO. It is common for the asset manager to retain a piece of the equity tranche. In addition, the underwriter was generally expected to provide some type of secondary market liquidity for the CDO, especially its more senior tranches.
According to Thomson Financial, the top underwriters before September 2008 were Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America Securities.[91] CDOs are more profitable for underwriters than conventional bond underwriting because of the complexity involved. The underwriter is paid a fee when the CDO is issued.
The asset manager[edit]
The asset manager plays a key role in each CDO transaction, even after the CDO is issued. An experienced manager is critical in both the construction and maintenance of the CDO's portfolio. The manager can maintain the credit quality of a CDO's portfolio through trades as well as maximize recovery rates when defaults on the underlying assets occur.
In theory, the asset manager should add value in the manner outlined below, although in practice, this did not occur during the credit bubble of the mid-2000s (decade). In addition, it is now understood that the structural flaw in all asset-backed securities (originators profit from loan volume not loan quality) make the roles of subsequent participants peripheral to the quality of the investment.
The asset manager's role begins in the months before a CDO is issued, a bank usually provides financing to the manager to purchase some of the collateral assets for the forthcoming CDO. This process is called warehousing.
Even by the issuance date, the asset manager often will not have completed the construction of the CDO's portfolio. A "ramp-up" period following issuance during which the remaining assets are purchased can extend for several months after the CDO is issued. For this reason, some senior CDO notes are structured as delayed drawdown notes, allowing the asset manager to draw down cash from investors as collateral purchases are made. When a transaction is fully ramped, its initial portfolio of credits has been selected by the asset manager.
However, the asset manager's role continues even after the ramp-up period ends, albeit in a less active role. During the CDO's "reinvestment period", which usually extends several years past the issuance date of the CDO, the asset manager is authorized to reinvest principal proceeds by purchasing additional debt securities. Within the confines of the trading restrictions specified in the CDO's transaction documents, the asset manager can also make trades to maintain the credit quality of the CDO's portfolio. The manager also has a role in the redemption of a CDO's notes by auction call.
There are approximately 300 asset managers in the marketplace. CDO Asset Managers, as with other Asset Managers, can be more or less active depending on the personality and prospectus of the CDO. Asset Managers make money by virtue of the senior fee (which is paid before any of the CDO investors are paid) and subordinated fee as well as any equity investment the manager has in the CDO, making CDOs a lucrative business for asset managers. These fees, together with underwriting fees, administration—approx 1.5 - 2% -- by virtue of capital structure are provided by the equity investment, by virtue of reduced cashflow.

The trustee and collateral administrator[edit]
The trustee holds title to the assets of the CDO for the benefit of the "noteholders" (i.e., the investors). In the CDO market, the trustee also typically serves as collateral administrator. In this role, the collateral administrator produces and distributes noteholder reports, performs various compliance tests regarding the composition and liquidity of the asset portfolios in addition to constructing and executing the priority of payment waterfall models.[92] In contrast to the asset manager, there are relatively few trustees in the marketplace. The following institutions offer trustee services in the CDO marketplace:

Bank of New York Mellon (note: the Bank of New York Mellon acquired the corporate trust unit of JP Morgan),
BNP Paribas Securities Services (note: currently serves the European market only)
Citibank
Deutsche Bank
Equity Trust
Intertrust Group (note: until mid-2009 was known as Fortis Intertrust; Acquired ATC Capital Markets in 2013)
HSBC
Sanne Trust
State Street Corporation
US Bank (note: US Bank acquired the corporate trust unit of Wachovia in 2008 and Bank of America in September 2011, which had previously acquired LaSalle Bank in 2010, and is the current market share leader)
Wells Fargo
Wilmington Trust: Wilmington shut down their business in early 2009.

Accountants[edit]
The underwriter typically will hire an accounting firm to perform due diligence on the CDO's portfolio of debt securities. This entails verifying certain attributes, such as credit rating and coupon/spread, of each collateral security. Source documents or public sources will typically be used to tie-out the collateral pool information. In addition, the accountants typically calculate certain collateral tests and determine whether the portfolio is in compliance with such tests.
The firm may also perform a cash flow tie-out in which the transaction's waterfall is modeled per the priority of payments set forth in the transaction documents. The yield and weighted average life of the bonds or equity notes being issued is then calculated based on the modeling assumptions provided by the underwriter. On each payment date, an accounting firm may work with the trustee to verify the distributions that are scheduled to be made to the noteholders.
Attorneys[edit]
Attorneys ensure compliance with applicable securities law and negotiate and draft the transaction documents. Attorneys will also draft an offering document or prospectus the purpose of which is to satisfy statutory requirements to disclose certain information to investors. This will be circulated to investors. It is common for multiple counsels to be involved in a single deal because of the number of parties to a single CDO from asset management firms to underwriters.

^ An "asset-backed security" is sometimes used as an umbrella term for a type of security backed by a pool of assets—including collateralized debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities (Example: "A capital market in which asset-backed securities are issued and traded is composed of three main categories: ABS, MBS and CDOs".

—and sometimes for a particular type of that security—one backed by consumer loans (example: "As a rule of thumb, securitization issues backed by mortgages are called MBS, and securitization issues backed by debt obligations are called CDO, [and] Securitization issues backed by consumer-backed products—car loans, consumer loans and credit cards, among others—are called ABS ...

(source: Anna Katherine Barnett-Hart The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis-March 2009)
^ Other sources give an even higher proportion. In the fall of 2005 Gene Park, an executive at AIG Financial Products division found, "The percentage of subprime securities in the CDOs wasn't 10 percent -- it was 85 percent!" (source: McLean and Nocera, All the Devils Are Here, 2010 (p.201)
^ An email by Park to his superior is also quoted in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report p.201: "The CDO of the ABS market ... is currently at a state where deals are almost totally reliant on subprime/nonprime mortgage residential mortgage collateral."
^ Still another source (The Big Short, Michael Lewis, p.71) says:
"The `consumer loans` piles that Wall Street firms, led by Goldman Sachs, asked AIG FP to insure went from being 2% subprime mortgages to being 95% subprime mortgages. In a matter of months, AIG-FP, in effect, bought $50 billion in triple-B-rated subprime mortgage bonds by insuring them against default. And yet no one said anything about it ..."
^ In 2007, 47% of CDOs were backed by structured products, such as mortgages; 45% of CDOs were backed by loans, and only less than 10% of CDOs were backed by fixed income securities. (source: Securitization rankings of bookrunners, issuers, etc.

They bear a lower credit rating triple B. ... if you could somehow get them rerated as triple A, thereby lowering their perceived risk, however dishonestly and artificially. This is what Goldman Sachs had cleverly done. it was absurd. The 100 buildings occupied the same floodplain; in the event of flood, the ground floors of all of them were equally exposed. But never mind: the rating agencies, who were paid fat fees by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms for each deal they rated, pronounced 80% of the new tower of debt triple-A."

Market-linked (e.g., equity or currency indexes) certificates of deposit, which carry FDIC insurance protection on the invested principal, subject to FDIC coverage limits ($250,000 per account owner per institution); or
Senior unsecured obligations of the issuer, which are not FDIC-insured.

How They Work













As with any new issue offering, prospective investors should read the prospectus which provides greater detail on the offering and its structure. Customers may then submit indications of interest during an order period. At issuance, customers typically receive an allocation amount equal to the indication of interest that was submitted. However, submitting an indication of interest does not guarantee an allocation. If the offering is oversubscribed (more securities were requested than available for purchase), and you did not withdraw your order, you may receive only a portion of the securities you requested, or none at all. Further, if the offering is undersubscribed, the offering can be pulled.
Investments in structured products that are FDIC-insured involve the issuance of an underlying certificate of deposit, which is the sole obligation of the issuing bank. This underlying CD provides the FDIC protection on this investment. Non-FDIC-insured structured products have no CD issuance. With these investments, which are unsecured debt, customers are unsecured creditors of the issuer.
 Components of Fidelity’s structured products 
The structured products offered through Fidelity.com include the following components:
Payout profile
Fidelity currently offers only a point-to-point payout profile. A payout profile represents how a customer's cumulative return is measured. The return of the structured products available on Fidelity.com is measured based on two points: point A (initial or starting index level, which is typically the closing value of the index on the pricing date) and point B (final index level, which is typically the closing value of the index on a date specified in the offering document). The product will provide its investment return based on the following formula:
(final index level – starting index level)

starting index level
Certain structured products impose limits on return potential in the form of a "cap" or may limit your participation in the upside performance of the linked index or customized basket (see below).
Participation rate
The potential return to the investor depends in part on what is known as the participation rate. If the participation rate of the structured product is less than 100%, the investor will realize a return that is less than the return of the linked index or customized basket. For example, if the participation rate is 80%, the investor will receive only 80% of any positive return on the index or basket, assuming no other limits on return potential. The participation rate will vary by product, and factors such as index type, maturity, and caps affect the rate.
Cap
A cap represents a ceiling above which the investor does not participate in further upside gains of the linked index or basket. In other words, if the linked index or benchmark generates a return greater than the stated cap, investors will not receive any returns in excess of the capped return. For example, if a structured product allows for 100% participation in an index subject to a 50% cap, the investor cannot earn more than 50% on the investment even if the investment appreciates above that.
Costs and fees
Placement fees, structuring, development, and other costs will vary and may impact secondary market prices for structured products. Investors should consider these and any other costs and fees covered in the offering document prior to investing.
Taxes
Structured products may be considered contingent payment debt instruments for federal income tax purposes. This means you'll usually have to pay income taxes each year on imputed annual income even though you may not receive a cash payment until maturity. In addition, any gain realized upon the sale of these products may be treated as ordinary income. Please refer to the offering document for the specific tax treatment of a structured product and consult your tax advisor for more details.













Features & Benefits













 Market participation 
Investors participate only in the upside performance of the underlying index. Principal is not at risk from negative performance of the index, but is subject to issuer credit and default risk.
 Access to alternative asset classes 
Investors gain exposure to asset classes such as currencies and commodities that might otherwise be difficult to access.













Risks













 Credit and default risk 
Structured products are subject to the risk of default by the issuer. Therefore, the financial condition and creditworthiness of the issuer are important considerations when assessing the ability of the issuer to meet its obligations according to the terms of the structured product. In summary, if the issuer defaults or declares bankruptcy, the investor may lose all or some of the investment. In the case of FDIC-insured market-linked CDs, deposit amounts exceeding applicable FDIC coverage limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank. Other limitations on FDIC coverage may apply. Structured products which are senior unsecured notes are not FDIC-insured. In the event of issuer default on a non-FDIC-insured product, repayment of principal would be subject to the issuer's restructuring and liquidation process and is in no way guaranteed.
 Limited FDIC protection 
For FDIC-insured market-linked CDs, FDIC coverage generally applies to the amount of invested principal only. Any appreciation relating to the linked index or benchmark is not FDIC-insured. If you hold more than the FDIC-insured limitations in deposits with the issuing bank, you will not receive the benefit of FDIC insurance for any balance in excess of FDIC limits. In this instance, amounts in excess of FDIC-insured limits are subject to the credit risk of the issuing bank.
 Liquidity risk 
Structured products are intended to be held until maturity. Due to a limited secondary market, it may not be possible to sell a structured product prior to maturity. Additionally, should a secondary market exist, investors who need to sell a structured product prior to maturity may be subject to a significant loss.
 Market or opportunity risk 
The potential return on structured products is subject to market volatility and the risks associated with the linked index or basket. The return of a structured product may be zero or less than what could have been earned on a traditional fixed income security.
 Derivatives risk 
The issuers of structured products may choose to hedge their obligations by entering into derivatives and/or trading in one or more instruments, such as options, swaps, or futures. The costs associated with such hedging activity could affect the market value of a structured product or the price at which the issuer may be willing to purchase a structured product in the secondary market.
 Commodity price risk 
If the investment benchmark is linked to one or more commodities, you may be subject to market volatility and risks relating to commodities. Trading in commodity futures contracts associated with an underlying commodity index is speculative and can be extremely volatile. The performance of the commodity index or basket of commodities may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced commodity or commodities.
 Currency and exchange rate risk 
If the investment benchmark is linked to a foreign currency or currency basket, you may be subject to foreign currency risks. The value of foreign currencies can be highly volatile and may change based on various factors, which may include changes in national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign inflation rates, domestic and foreign interest rates, and global or regional political, regulatory, economic or financial events. Performance may deviate significantly from the performance of the referenced currencies or exchange rates.













Examples













The scenarios presented below are hypothetical. Actual investment performance may differ. In all cases, return of original investment principal is subject to the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor.
 Scenario 1: The index rises 
Assume return is tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index. In this scenario, the index rose 50% over the life of the structured product; in other words, it was up 50% between purchase date and maturity. Further, assume an original investment of $1,000 and an 80% participation rate. Given these conditions, the return to the investor would be $400 ($1,000 × 50% × 80%). So at maturity, the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal, plus the $400 index return amount, for a total of $1,400.



 Scenario 2: The index falls 
In this scenario, assume return is again tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index, but in this case, the index falls 50% over the life of the structured product. The customer would not receive any additional returns under the participation rate; instead he or she would be paid according to the principal return at maturity percentage offered by the structured product. Assuming it was 100%, then regardless of how far the index fell, the customer would receive a full return (i.e., 100%) of his or her initial invested principal at the end of the term. In this example, the customer invested $1,000 and would receive it back at maturity.



 Scenario 3: A capped return 
In this final scenario, again assume return is tied to the performance of the S&P 500® Index. Assume again that the index rose 50% over the life of the structured product. Further, assume an original investment of $1,000 and an 80% participation rate. Finally, assume a cap of 35%. Given these conditions, the return to the investor would be the lesser of the participation amount of $400 ($1,000 × 50% × 80%) OR the cap amount of $350 ($1,000 × 35%). So in this scenario, the customer would receive the amount of his or her original investment principal, plus the $350 cap index return amount, for a total of $1,350.



These examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to predict or project the performance of any investment or security. Taxes, inflation, fees and/or expenses were not taken into account. If they had been deducted, performance would have been lower. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Your performance will vary, and you may have a gain or loss if you sell prior to maturity. Before you start, you should review all of the assumptions for these hypothetical examples.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES;

REMEDIES AND BREACH

(a) Due Organization and Authority. The Company is a federally
chartered savings bank duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the United States and has all licenses necessary to carry on
its business as now being conducted and is licensed, qualified and in good
standing in each state where a Mortgaged Property is located if the laws of such
state require licensing or qualification in order to conduct business of the
type conducted by the Company, and in any event the Company is in compliance
with the laws of any such state to the extent necessary to ensure the
enforceability of the related Mortgage Loan and the servicing of such Mortgage
Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; the Company has the full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform in accordance herewith; the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement (including all instruments of transfer to be delivered pursuant to
this Agreement) by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized; this Agreement
evidences the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company; and all
requisite corporate action has been taken by the Company to make this Agreement
valid and binding upon the Company in accordance with its terms;


(b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of
business of the Company, and the transfer, assignment and conveyance of the
Mortgage Notes and the Mortgages by the Company pursuant to this Agreement are
not subject to the bulk transfer or any similar statutory provisions in effect
in any applicable jurisdiction;


(c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the acquisition of the Mortgage Loans by the Company, the sale of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser or the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the
fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Company's charter or by-laws or any legal restriction or any
agreement or instrument to which the Company is now a party or by which it is
bound, or constitute a default or result in an acceleration under any of the
foregoing, or result in the violation of any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree to which the Company or its property is subject, or impair
the ability of the Purchaser to realize on the Mortgage Loans, or impair the
value of the Mortgage Loans;

service mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and no event has occurred,

Mac;

agrees that the Servicing Fee, as calculated at the Servicing Fee Rate,

it have any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot comply in all material
respects each and every covenant contained in this Agreement. The Company is
solvent and the sale of the Mortgage Loans will not cause the Company to become
insolvent. The sale of the Mortgage Loans is not undertaken with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud any of the Company's creditors;


(g) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the best of the Company's knowledge,
threatened against the Company which, either in any one instance or in the
aggregate, may result in any material adverse change in the business,
operations, financial condition, properties or assets of the Company, or in any
material impairment of the right or ability of the Company to carry on its
business substantially as now conducted, or in any material liability on the
part of the Company, or which would draw into question the validity of this
Agreement or the Mortgage Loans or of any action taken or to be taken in
connection with the obligations of the Company contemplated herein, or which
would be likely to impair materially the ability of the Company to perform under
the terms of this Agreement;

or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the

Company with this Agreement or the sale of the Mortgage Loans as evidenced by
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or if
required, such approval has been obtained prior to the related Closing Date;

a manner so as to affect adversely the interests of the Purchaser;


(j) Pool Characteristics. With respect to each Mortgage Loan
Package, the Mortgage Loan characteristics set forth on Exhibit 2 to the related
Assignment and Conveyance are true and complete.


(k) No Untrue Information. Neither this Agreement (with the
exception of sub-part (j) of this Section) nor any statement, report or other
document furnished or to be furnished pursuant to this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby contains any material
untrue statement of fact regarding the Company or omits to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein regarding the Seller not
misleading;


-17-





(l) Sale Treatment. The Company has determined that the
disposition of the Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement will be afforded
sale treatment for accounting and tax purposes;


(m) Financial Statements. The Company has delivered to the

any later quarter ended more than 60 days prior to the execution of this
Agreement. All such financial statements fairly present the pertinent results of
operations and changes in financial position at the end of each such period of
the Company and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied throughout the
periods involved, except as set forth in the notes thereto. There has been no
change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of
the Company since the date of the Company's financial statements that would have
a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.;


(n) No Brokers' Fees. The Company has not dealt with any
broker, investment banker, agent or other person that may be entitled to any
commission or compensation in connection with the sale of the Mortgage Loans;


(o) Insured Depository Institution Representations. Company is
an "insured depository institution" as that term is defined in Section
1813(c)(2) of Title 12 of the United States Code, as amended, and accordingly,
Company makes the following additional representations and warranties:


(i) This Agreement between Purchaser and Company conforms to
all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; and


(ii) This Agreement is (1) executed contemporaneously with the
agreement reached by Purchaser and Company, and (2) an official record
of the Company. A copy of such resolution, certified by a vice
president or higher officer of Company has been provided to Purchaser.


Section 3.02 Representations and Warranties Regarding
Individual Mortgage Loans.


As to each Mortgage Loan, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to the Purchaser that as of the related Closing Date:


(a) Mortgage Loans as Described. The information set forth in
the Mortgage Loan Schedule is materially complete, true and correct;


(b) Payments Current. All payments required to be made up to
the related Closing Date for the Mortgage Loan under the terms of the Mortgage
Note have been made and credited. No payment required under the Mortgage Loan is
30 days or more delinquent nor has any payment under the Mortgage Loan been
delinquent for 30 days or more in the 12 months preceding the related Closing
Date. The first Monthly Payment was made with respect to the Mortgage Loan
within 30 days of its Due Date;


-18-





(c) No Outstanding Charges. There are no material defaults in
complying with the terms of the Mortgage, and all taxes, governmental
assessments, insurance premiums, water, sewer and municipal charges, leasehold
payments or ground rents which previously became due and owing have been paid,
or, with respect to each Escrow Mortgage Loan, an escrow of funds has been
established in an amount sufficient to pay for every such item which remains
unpaid and which has been assessed but is not yet due and payable. The Company
has not advanced funds, or induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance
of funds by a party other than the Mortgagor, directly or indirectly, for the
payment of any amount required under the Mortgage Loan, except for interest
accruing from the date of the Mortgage Note or date of disbursement of the
Mortgage Loan proceeds, whichever is earlier, to the day which precedes by one
month the Due Date of the first installment of principal and interest;


(d) Original Terms Unmodified. The terms of the Mortgage Note
and Mortgage have not been impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect,
except by a written instrument which has been recorded, if necessary to protect
the interests of the Purchaser and which has been delivered to the Custodian.
The substance of any such waiver, alteration or modification has been approved
by the issuer of any related PMI Policy and the title insurer, to the extent
required by the policy, and its terms are reflected on the Mortgage Loan
Schedule. No Mortgagor has been released, in whole or in part, except in
connection with an assumption agreement approved by the issuer of any related
PMI Policy and the title insurer, to the extent required by the policy, and
which assumption agreement is part of the Mortgage Loan File delivered to the
Custodian and the terms of which are reflected in the Mortgage Loan Schedule;


(e) No Defenses. The Mortgage Loan is not subject to any right
of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including without limitation
the defense of usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage
Note or the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either the
Mortgage Note or the Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to
any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including without
limitation the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto, and no Mortgagor
was a debtor in any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or was
subject to a foreclosure proceeding, at the time the Mortgage Loan was
originated or during the 24 months prior to origination;


(f) Hazard Insurance. With respect to Mortgage Loans other
than Cooperative Loans, pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, all buildings or
other improvements upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by a generally
acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such
other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is
located pursuant to insurance policies conforming to the requirements of Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac. If, upon origination of the Mortgage Loan (other than a
Cooperative Loan), the Mortgaged Property was in an area identified in the
Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special
flood hazards (and such flood insurance has been made available) a flood
insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
Federal Flood Insurance Administration is in effect which policy conforms to the
requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. With respect to each Cooperative
Loan, the related Cooperative Project is insured by a generally acceptable
insurer against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other
hazards as are customary in the area where the Cooperative Project is located
pursuant to insurance policies conforming to the requirements of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. All individual insurance policies contain a standard mortgagee
clause naming the Company and its successors and assigns as mortgagee, and all
premiums thereon have been paid. The Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor thereunder


-19-





to maintain the hazard insurance policy at the Mortgagor's cost and expense, and
on the Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the Mortgage to
obtain and maintain such insurance at such Mortgagor's cost and expense, and to
seek reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor. Where required by state law or
regulation, with respect to Mortgage Loans other than Cooperative Loans, the
Mortgagor has been given an opportunity to choose the carrier of the required
hazard insurance, provided the policy is not a "master" or "blanket" hazard
insurance policy covering the common facilities of a planned unit development.
The hazard insurance policy is the valid and binding obligation of the insurer,
is in full force and effect, and will be in full force and effect and inure to
the benefit of the Purchaser upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has not engaged in, and has no
knowledge of the Mortgagor's or any subservicer's having engaged in, any act or
omission which would impair the coverage of any such policy, the benefits of the
endorsement provided for herein, or the validity and binding effect of either,
including, without limitation, no unlawful fee, commission, kickback or other
unlawful compensation or value of any kind has been or will be received,
retained or realized by any attorney, firm or other person or entity, and no
such unlawful items have been received, retained or realized by the Company;


(g) Compliance with Applicable Laws. Each Mortgage Loan at the
time it was made complied in all material respects with applicable local, state,
and federal laws, including, but not limited to all applicable predatory and
abusive lending laws and any and all requirements of any federal, state or local
law (including, without limitation, usury, truth-in-lending, real estate
settlement procedures, consumer credit protection, equal credit opportunity,
disclosure laws, all applicable predatory and abusive lending laws or unfair and
deceptive practices laws) applicable to the Mortgage Loan have been complied
with, and the Company shall maintain in its possession, available for the
Purchaser's inspection, and shall deliver to the Purchaser upon demand, evidence
of compliance with all such requirements.


(h) No Satisfaction of Mortgage. The Mortgage has not been
satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded, in whole or in part, and the
Mortgaged Property has not been released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole
or in part, nor has any instrument been executed that would effect any such
release, cancellation, subordination or rescission. The Company has not waived
the performance by the Mortgagor of any action, if the Mortgagor's failure to
perform such action would cause the Mortgage Loan to be in default, nor has the
Company waived any default resulting from any action or inaction by the
Mortgagor;


(i) Location and Type of Mortgaged Property. The Mortgaged
Property (other than with respect to a Cooperative Loan) is a fee simple
property. The Mortgaged Property or, with respect to each Cooperative Loan,
Cooperative Unit is located in the state identified in the related Mortgage Loan
Schedule and consists of a single parcel of real property with a detached single
family residence erected thereon, or a two- to four-family dwelling, or an
individual condominium unit in a low-rise condominium project, or a Cooperative
Unit, or an individual unit in a planned unit development, provided, however,
that (I) any condominium unit or planned unit development shall conform with the
Company's Underwriting Guidelines regarding such dwellings, and (II) that no
residence or dwelling is a mobile home or manufactured housing. No portion of
the Mortgaged Property or, with respect to each Cooperative Loan, the
Cooperative Unit is used for commercial purposes;


-20-





(j) Valid First Lien. The Mortgage (other than with respect to
a Cooperative Loan) is a valid, subsisting, enforceable and perfected first
priority lien and first priority security interest on the Mortgaged Property,
including all buildings on the Mortgaged Property and all installations and
mechanical, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning systems located
in or annexed to such buildings, and all additions, alterations and replacements
made at any time with respect to the foregoing. The lien of the Mortgage (other
than with respect to a Cooperative Loan) is subject only to:


(1) the lien of current real property taxes and assessments
not yet due and payable;


(2) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way,
easements and other matters of the public record as of the date of
recording acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally and
specifically referred to in the lender's title insurance policy
delivered to the originator of the Mortgage Loan and (i) referred to or
to otherwise considered in the appraisal made for the originator of the
Mortgage Loan or (ii) which do not adversely affect the Appraised Value
of the Mortgaged Property set forth in such appraisal; and


(3) other matters to which like properties are commonly
subject which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the
security intended to be provided by the mortgage or the use, enjoyment,
value or marketability of the related Mortgaged Property.


Any security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to and
delivered in connection with the Mortgage Loan establishes and creates a valid,
subsisting and enforceable first lien and first priority security interest on
the property described therein and the Company has full right to sell and assign
the same to the Purchaser. The Mortgaged Property was not, as of the date of
origination of the Mortgage Loan, subject to a mortgage, deed of trust, deed to
secured debt or other security instrument creating a lien subordinate to the
lien of the Mortgage;


(k) Validity of Mortgage Documents. The Mortgage Note and the
Mortgage are genuine, and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
maker thereof enforceable in accordance with its terms except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. All parties to the
Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and any other related agreement had legal
capacity to enter into the Mortgage Loan and to execute and deliver the Mortgage
Note and the Mortgage and any other related agreement, and the Mortgage Note,
the Mortgage and any other related agreement have been duly and properly
executed by such parties. The Company has reviewed all of the documents
constituting the Servicing File and has made such inquiries as it deems
necessary to make and confirm the accuracy of the representations set forth
herein;


-21-





(l) Full Disbursement of Proceeds. The Mortgage Loan has been
closed and the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed and there
is no requirement for future advances thereunder, and any and all requirements
as to completion of any on-site or off-site improvement and as to disbursements
of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with. All costs, fees and
expenses incurred in making or closing the Mortgage Loan and the recording of
the Mortgage were paid, and the Mortgagor is not entitled to any refund of any
amounts paid or due under the Mortgage Note or Mortgage;


(m) Ownership. The Company is the sole owner of record and
holder of the Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan is not assigned or pledged, and
the Company has good and marketable title thereto, and has full right to
transfer and sell the Mortgage Loan therein to the Purchaser free and clear of
any encumbrance, equity, participation interest, lien, pledge, charge, claim or
security interest, and has full right and authority subject to no interest or
participation of, or agreement with, any other party, to sell and assign each
Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Agreement;


(n) Doing Business. All parties which have had any interest in
the Mortgage Loan, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise, are

(or, during the period in which they held and disposed of such interest, were)

(1) in compliance with any and all applicable licensing requirements of the laws
of the state wherein the Mortgaged Property or with respect to each Cooperative
Loan, the Cooperative Unit, is located, and (2) organized under the laws of such
state, or (3) qualified to do business in such state, or (4) federal savings and
loan associations or national banks having principal offices in such state, or

(5) not doing business in such state;


(o) LTV, PMI Policy. If the LTV of the Mortgage Loan is more
than 80% (an "80% Loan") either (i) the Mortgage Loan will be insured as to
payment defaults by a PMI Policy acceptable to Fannie Mae until the LTV of such
Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80% (a "PMI Loan") or (ii) such Mortgage Loan is
listed on an exhibit to the applicable Assignment and Conveyance. All provisions
of such PMI Policy have been and are being complied with, such policy is in full
force and effect, and all premiums due thereunder have been paid. No action,
inaction, or event has occurred and no state of facts exists that has, or will
result in the exclusion from, denial of, or defense to coverage. Any Mortgage
Loan subject to a PMI Policy obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain the
PMI Policy and to pay all premiums and charges in connection therewith. The
Mortgage Interest Rate for the Mortgage Loan as set forth on the Mortgage Loan
Schedule is net of any such insurance premium. All information provided by the
Company to the PMI Policy insurer is accurate and complete. The Company has
notified the PMI Policy insurer of the sale of the Mortgage Loan to the
Purchaser. The Company has no knowledge of any potential cancellation or
rescission of the PMI Policy and has had no dialogue with the PMI Policy insurer
regarding any issues or circumstances which may result in a cancellation or
rescission of the PMI Policy;


-22-





(p) Title Insurance. The Mortgage Loan (other than each
Cooperative Loan) is covered by an ALTA lender's title insurance policy or other
generally acceptable form of policy of insurance acceptable to Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac, issued by a title insurer acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
and qualified to do business in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is
located, insuring the Company, its successors and assigns, as to the first
priority lien, as applicable, of the Mortgage, in the original principal amount
of the Mortgage Loan, subject only to the exceptions contained in clauses (1),

(2) and (3) of paragraph (j) of this Section 3.02. Where required by state law
or regulation, the Mortgagor has been given the opportunity to choose the
carrier of the required mortgage title insurance. Additionally, such lender's
title insurance policy affirmatively insures ingress and egress, and against
encroachments by or upon the Mortgaged Property or any interest therein. The
Company is the sole insured of such lender's title insurance policy, and such
lender's title insurance policy is in full force and effect and will be in force
and effect upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No claims have been made under such lender's title insurance policy,
and no prior holder of the Mortgage, including the Company, has done, by act or
omission, anything which would impair the coverage of such lender's title
insurance policy including without limitation, no unlawful fee, commission,
kickback or other unlawful compensation or value of any kind has been or will be
received, retained or realized by any attorney, firm or other person or entity,
and no such unlawful items have been received, retained or realized by the
Company;


(q) No Defaults. There is no material default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the Mortgage
Note and no event which, with the passage of time or with notice and the
expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration, and neither the Company nor its predecessors
have waived any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration;


(r) No Mechanics' Liens. There are no mechanics' or similar
liens or claims which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights
are outstanding that under the law could give rise to such liens) affecting the
related Mortgaged Property which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or
coordinate with, the lien of the related Mortgage;


(s) Location of Improvements; No Encroachments. All
improvements which were considered in determining the Appraised Value of the
Mortgaged Property lay wholly within the boundaries and building restriction
lines of the Mortgaged Property or, with respect to each Cooperative Loan, the
Cooperative Unit and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the
Mortgaged Property or, with respect to each Cooperative Loan, the Cooperative
Unit. No improvement located on or being part of the Mortgaged Property or, with
respect to each Cooperative Loan, the Cooperative Unit is in violation of any
applicable zoning law or regulation;


(t) Origination: Payment Terms. At the time the Mortgage Loan
was originated, the originator was a mortgagee approved by the Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development pursuant to Sections 203 and 211 of the National
Housing Act or a savings and loan association, a savings bank, a commercial bank
or similar banking institution which is supervised and examined by a Federal or
State authority. The Mortgage Interest Rate is (a) with respect to fixed rate
mortgage loans, the fixed interest rate set forth in the Mortgage Note and (b)
with respect to ARM Mortgage Loans, adjusted on each Interest Rate Adjustment
Date to equal the Index plus the Gross Margin, rounded up. Except with respect
to interest only Mortgage Loans, the Mortgage Note is payable each month in
equal monthly installments of principal and interest, with interest calculated
and payable in arrears, and except for any balloon Mortgage Loan, sufficient to
amortize the Mortgage Loan fully by the stated maturity date, over an original
term of not more than thirty years from commencement of amortization. The
interest only Mortgage Loans are payable in equal monthly installments of
interest for the initial three or five year period (as applicable) and
thereafter payable each month in equal monthly installments of principal and
interest, with interest calculated and payable in arrears sufficient to amortize
the Mortgage Loan fully by the stated maturity date, over an original term of
not more than thirty years from commencement of amortization. No Mortgage Loan
provides for negative amortization.


-23-





(u) Customary Provisions. With respect to each Mortgage Loan
other than a Cooperative Loan, the Mortgage contains customary and enforceable
provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof
adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of the benefits of
the security provided thereby, including, (i) in the case of a Mortgage
designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (ii) otherwise by judicial
foreclosure. Upon default by a Mortgagor on a Mortgage Loan and foreclosure on,
or trustee's sale of, the Mortgaged Property pursuant to the proper procedures,
the holder of the Mortgage Loan will be able to deliver good and merchantable
title to the Mortgaged Property. To the best of the Company's knowledge, there
is no homestead or other exemption available to a Mortgagor which would
interfere with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or
the right to foreclose the Mortgage;


(v) Conformance with Underwriting Guidelines. The Mortgage
Loan was underwritten in accordance with the Company's underwriting guidelines
in effect at the time the Mortgage Loan was originated, a copy of which
underwriting guidelines are attached as Exhibit H hereto. The Mortgage Note and
Mortgage are on forms acceptable to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae;


(w) Occupancy of the Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Unit.
As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan, the Mortgaged
Property or Cooperative Unit, as applicable is lawfully occupied under
applicable law. All inspections, licenses and certificates required to be made
or issued with respect to all occupied portions of the Mortgaged Property or
Cooperative Unit, as applicable, and, with respect to the use and occupancy of
the same, including but not limited to certificates of occupancy and fire
underwriting certificates, have been made or obtained from the appropriate
authorities;


(x) No Additional Collateral. The Mortgage Note is not and has
not been secured by any collateral except the lien of the corresponding Mortgage
and the security interest of any applicable security agreement or chattel
mortgage referred to in (j) above;


(y) Deeds of Trust. In the event the Mortgage constitutes a
deed of trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such,
has been properly designated and currently so serves and is named in the
Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the Purchaser to
the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection with a trustee's sale
after default by the Mortgagor;


-24-





(z) Acceptable Investment. The Company has no knowledge of any
circumstances or conditions with respect to the Mortgage, the Mortgaged
Property, or Cooperative Unit, as applicable, the Mortgagor or the Mortgagor's
credit standing that can reasonably be expected to cause private institutional
investors using reasonable business judgment to regard the Mortgage Loan as an
unacceptable investment, cause the Mortgage Loan to become delinquent, or
adversely affect the value or marketability of the Mortgage Loan;


(aa) Delivery of Mortgage Documents. The Mortgage Note, the
Mortgage, the Assignment of Mortgage and any other documents required to be
delivered for the Mortgage Loan by the Company under this Agreement as set forth
in Exhibit C attached hereto have been delivered to the Custodian. The Company
is in possession of a complete, true and accurate Mortgage File in compliance
with Exhibit B, except for such documents the originals of which have been
delivered to the Custodian;


(bb) Condominiums/Planned Unit Developments. If the Mortgaged
Property is a condominium unit or a planned unit development (other than a de
minimis planned unit development) such condominium or planned unit development
project meets Fannie Mae eligibility requirements for sale to Fannie Mae or is
located in a condominium or planned unit development project which has received
Fannie Mae project approval and the representations and warranties required by
Fannie Mae with respect to such condominium or planned unit development have
been made and remain true and correct in all respects;


(cc) Transfer of Mortgage Loans. The Assignment of Mortgage is
in recordable form and is acceptable for recording under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is located;


(dd) Due on Sale. For each fixed rate Mortgage Loan and for
each ARM Mortgage Loan prior to the first Interest Rate Adjustment Date, the
Mortgage, contains an enforceable provision for the acceleration of the payment
of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in the event that the
Mortgaged Property or Cooperative Shares, as applicable, is sold or transferred
without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee thereunder;


(ee) No Buydown Provisions; No Graduated Payments or
Contingent Interests. The Mortgage Loan does not contain provisions pursuant to
which Monthly Payments are paid or partially paid with funds deposited in any
separate account established by the Company, the Mortgagor or anyone on behalf
of the Mortgagor, or paid by any source other than the Mortgagor nor does it
contain any other similar provisions currently in effect which may constitute a
"buydown" provision. The Mortgage Loan is not a graduated payment mortgage loan
and the Mortgage Loan does not have a shared appreciation or other contingent
interest feature;


(ff) Consolidation of Future Advances. Any future advances
made prior to the related Cut-off Date have been consolidated with the
outstanding principal amount secured by the Mortgage, and the secured principal
amount, as consolidated, bears a single interest rate and single repayment term.
The lien of the Mortgage securing the consolidated principal amount is expressly
insured as having first lien priority by a title insurance policy, an
endorsement to the policy insuring the mortgagee's consolidated interest or by
other title evidence acceptable to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The consolidated
principal amount does not exceed the original principal amount of the Mortgage
Loan;


-25-





(gg) Mortgaged Property Undamaged. At origination, there was
no proceeding pending or threatened for the total or partial condemnation of the
Mortgaged Property or the Cooperative Project, as applicable. The Mortgaged
Property or the Cooperative Project, as applicable, is undamaged by waste, fire,
earthquake or earth movement, windstorm, flood, tornado or other casualty so as
to affect adversely the value of the Mortgaged Property or the Cooperative
Project, as applicable, as security for the Mortgage Loan or the use for which
the premises were intended;


(hh) Collection Practices; Escrow Deposits; ARM Adjustments.
The origination and collection practices used with respect to the Mortgage Loan
have been in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices, in all respects in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. With respect to escrow
deposits and Escrow Payments, all such payments are in the possession of the
Company and there exist no deficiencies in connection therewith for which
customary arrangements for repayment thereof have not been made. All Escrow
Payments have been collected in full compliance with state and federal law. An
escrow of funds is not prohibited by applicable law and has been established in
an amount sufficient to pay for every item which remains unpaid and which has
been assessed but is not yet due and payable. No escrow deposits or Escrow
Payments or other charges or payments due the Seller have been capitalized under
the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note. All Mortgage Interest Rate adjustments have
been made in strict compliance with state and federal law and the terms of the
related Mortgage Note. Any interest required to be paid pursuant to state and
local law has been properly paid and credited;


(ii) Appraisal. The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the
related Mortgage Property or the Cooperative Unit, as applicable, signed prior
to the approval of the Mortgage Loan application by a Qualified Appraiser. Each
Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgage Property or the
Cooperative Unit, as applicable, signed prior to the approval of the Mortgage
Loan application by a Qualified Appraiser. The Appraised Value as set forth on
the Appraisal accurately reflects the value of the Mortgage Property, and takes
into consideration the condition of the Mortgaged Property, all improvements
made to the Mortgaged Property, and the market value of similar mortgaged
properties in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located. Any variance of
15% or more in the value of the Mortgaged Property from the Appraised Value
shall be deemed to be material.

notified the Company, and the Company has no knowledge of any relief requested
or allowed to the Mortgagor under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of
1940;


(kk) Environmental Matters. To the best of the Company's
knowledge, the Mortgaged Property or the Cooperative Unit, as applicable, is
free from any and all toxic or hazardous substances and there exists no
violation of any local, state or federal environmental law, rule or regulation.
There is no pending action or proceeding directly involving any Mortgaged
Property or Cooperative Unit, as applicable, of which the Company is aware in
which compliance with any environmental law, rule or regulation is an issue; and
to the best of the Company's knowledge, nothing further remains to be done to
satisfy in full all requirements of each such law, rule or regulation
constituting a prerequisite to use and enjoyment of said property;

irrespective of the cause of such failure of coverage. In connection with the
placement of any such insurance, no commission, fee, or other compensation has

"living trust" and such "living trust" is in compliance with Fannie Mae
guidelines for such trusts.


(pp) Texas Home Equity Loans. With respect to any Mortgage
Loan which is a Texas Home Equity Loan, any and all requirements of Section 50,
Article XVI of the Texas Constitution applicable to Texas Home Equity Loans
which were in effect at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan have
been complied with. Specifically, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, any fees paid in connection with such Mortgage Loan in order for the
Mortgagor to receive a reduced interest rate are not required to be included in
the calculation of the aggregate fees pursuant to Section 50(a)(6)(E) of the
Texas Constitution.

the Purchaser) have been recorded in the appropriate jurisdictions wherein such
recordation is necessary to perfect the lien thereof as against creditors of the
Company, or is in the process of being recorded;


(vv) FICO Scores. Each Mortgage Loan has a non-zero FICO

be enforced by the Company, and each prepayment penalty in permitted pursuant to
federal, state and local law, including the Parity Act of 1982. No Mortgage Loan
will impose a prepayment penalty for a term in excess of five years from the
date such Mortgage Loan was originated. Except as otherwise set forth in the
Mortgage Loan Schedule, with respect to each Mortgage Loan that contains a
prepayment fee, such prepayment fee is at least equal to the lesser of (A) the
maximum amount permitted under applicable law and (B) six months interest at the
related Mortgage Interest Rate on the amount prepaid in excess of 20% of the
original principal balance of such Mortgage Loan; and


(xx) Predatory Lending Regulations; High Cost Loans. None of
the Mortgage Loans are classified as (a) "high cost" loans under the Home
Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 or (b) "high cost," "threshold,"
"predatory", or "covered" loans under any other applicable state, federal or
local law


(yy) Cooperative Loans. With respect to each Cooperative Loan
the Company represents and warrants:


(i) the Cooperative Loan is secured by a valid, subsisting,
enforceable and perfected first lien on the corporation stock, shares
or membership certificate issued to the related Mortgagor with respect
to such Cooperative Loan. The lien of the Pledge Agreement is subject
only to the Cooperative Corporation's lien against such corporation
stock, shares or membership certificate for unpaid assessments of the
Cooperative Corporation to the extent required by applicable law. Any
security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to
and delivered in connection with the Cooperative Loan establishes and
creates a valid, subsisting and enforceable first lien and first
priority security interest on the property described therein and the
Company has full right to sell and assign the same to the Purchaser.
The Cooperative Unit was not, as of the date of origination of the
Cooperative Loan, subject to a mortgage, deed of trust, deed to secure
debt or other security instrument creating a lien subordinate to the
lien of the Pledge Agreement.

(ii) There is no proceeding pending or threatened for the
total or partial condemnation of the building owned by the applicable
Cooperative Corporation (the "Underlying Mortgaged Property"). The
Underlying Mortgaged Property is undamaged by waste, fire, earthquake
or earth movement, windstorm, flood, tornado or other casualty so as to
affect adversely the value of the Underlying Mortgaged Property as
security for the mortgage loan on such Underlying Mortgaged Property
(the "Cooperative Mortgage") or the use for which the premises were
intended.


(iii) There is no default, breach, violation or event of
acceleration existing under the Cooperative Mortgage or the mortgage
note related thereto and no event which, with the passage of time or
with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would
constitute a default, breach, violation or event of acceleration.


(iv) The Cooperative Corporation has been duly organized and
is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation. The Cooperative Corporation has
requisite power and authority to (i) own its properties, and (ii)
transact the business in which it is now engaged. The Cooperative
Corporation possesses all rights, licenses, permits and authorizations,
governmental or otherwise, necessary to entitle it to own its
properties and to transact the businesses in which is now engaged.


(v) The Cooperative Corporation complies in all material
respects with all applicable legal requirements. The Cooperative
Corporation is not in default or violation of any order, writ,
injunction, decree or demand of any governmental authority, the
violation of which might materially adversely affect the condition
(financial or otherwise) or business of the Cooperative Corporation.


(vi) The Company has delivered to the Purchaser or its
designee each of the following documents (collectively, the
"Cooperative Loan Documents"): (i) the Cooperative Loan Note, duly
endorsed in accordance with the endorsement requirements for Mortgage
Notes set forth in this Agreement, (ii) the Pledge Agreement,

successors in interest and assigns, under the Cooperative Loan,
accompanied by an assignment of such recognition agreement in blank,

(vi) UCC-1 financing statements with recording information thereon from
the appropriate state and county recording offices if necessary to
perfect the security interest of the Cooperative Loan under the Uniform
Commercial Code in the state in which the Cooperative Project is
located, accompanied by UCC-3 financing statements executed in blank
for recordation of the change in the secured party thereunder, and

(vii) any guarantees, if applicable. The Cooperative Loan Documents are
assignable to the Purchaser and its successors and assigns and have
been duly assigned to the Purchaser in accordance with this
sub-section (6).


-29-





(vii) The Pledge Agreement contains customary and enforceable
provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the holder
thereof adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of
the benefits of the security provided thereby.


(zz) No Fraud. Company does not have actual knowledge of any
material misrepresentation, fraud or similar occurrence with respect to a
Mortgage Loan that has taken place on the part of any person including without
limitation the Mortgagor, any appraiser, any builder or developer, or any other
party involved in the origination of the Mortgage Loan or, in the application of
any insurance in relation to such Mortgage Loan; no predatory or deceptive
lending practices, including, without limitation, the extension of credit
without regard to the ability of the borrower to repay and the extension of
credit which has no apparent benefit to the borrower, were employed in the
origination of the Mortgage Loan. The documents, instruments and agreements
submitted for loan underwriting were not falsified and contain no untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the information and statements therein not
misleading.


(aaa) Mortgagor Acknowledgment. The Mortgagor has executed a
statement to the effect that the Mortgagor has received all disclosure materials
required by applicable law with respect to the making of adjustable rate
mortgage loans. The Company shall maintain such statement in the Mortgage File.

has complied with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations,
including without limitation the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (collectively, the
"Anti-Money Laundering Laws"); the Company has established an anti-money
laundering compliance program as required by the Anti-Money Laundering Laws, has
conducted the requisite due diligence in connection with the origination of each
Mortgage Loan for purposes of the Anti-Money Laundering Laws, including with
respect to the legitimacy of the applicable Mortgagor and the origin of the
assets used by the said Mortgagor to purchase the property in question, and
maintains, and will maintain, sufficient information to identify the applicable
Mortgagor for purposes of the Anti-Money Laundering Laws.


(ccc) Credit Reporting. The Company has fully furnished in
accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing regulations,
accurate and complete information on the Mortgagor credit files to Equifax,

Section 3.03 Remedies for Breach of Representations and
Warranties.


(a) It is understood and agreed that the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.01 and 3.02 shall survive the sale of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser and the delivery of the Mortgage Loan Documents
to the Custodian and shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser,
notwithstanding any restrictive or qualified endorsement on any Mortgage Note or
Assignment of Mortgage or the examination or failure to examine any Mortgage
File. Upon discovery by either the Company or the Purchaser of a breach of any
of the foregoing representations and warranties which materially and adversely
affects the value of the Mortgage Loans or the interest of the Purchaser, or
which materially and adversely affects the interests of Purchaser in the related
Mortgage Loan in the case of a representation and warranty relating to a
particular Mortgage Loan (in the case of any of the foregoing, a "Breach"), the
party discovering such Breach shall give prompt written notice to the other.


-30-





Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice
to the Company of any Breach of a representation or warranty, the Company shall
use its best efforts promptly to cure such Breach in all material respects and,
if such Breach cannot be cured, the Company shall, at the Purchaser's option and
subject to Section 3.04, repurchase such Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price.
In the event that a Breach shall involve any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 3.01, and such Breach cannot be cured within 60 days of the
earlier of either discovery by or notice to the Company of such Breach, all of
the Mortgage Loans shall, at the Purchaser's option and subject to Section 3.04,
be repurchased by the Company at the Repurchase Price. However, if the Breach
shall involve a representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.02 and the
Company discovers or receives notice of any such Breach within 120 days of the
related Closing Date, the Company shall, at the Purchaser's option and provided
that the Company has a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, rather than
repurchase the Mortgage Loan as provided above, remove such Mortgage Loan (a
"Deleted Mortgage Loan") and substitute in its place a Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loan or Loans, provided that any such substitution shall be effected
not later than 120 days after the related Closing Date. If the Company has no
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, it shall repurchase the deficient Mortgage
Loan. Any repurchase of a Mortgage Loan or Loans pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.03 shall be accomplished by deposit in the
Custodial Account of the amount of the Repurchase Price for distribution to
Purchaser on the next scheduled Remittance Date, after deducting therefrom any
amount received in respect of such repurchased Mortgage Loan or Loans and being
held in the Custodial Account for future distribution.


At the time of repurchase or substitution, the Purchaser and
the Company shall arrange for the reassignment of the Deleted Mortgage Loan to
the Company and the delivery to the Company of any documents held by the
Custodian relating to the Deleted Mortgage Loan. In the event of a repurchase or
substitution, the Company shall, simultaneously with such reassignment, give
written notice to the Purchaser that such repurchase or substitution has taken
place, amend the related Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the withdrawal of the
Deleted Mortgage Loan from this Agreement, and, in the case of substitution,
identify a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan and amend the related Mortgage
Loan Schedule to reflect the addition of such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan
to this Agreement. In connection with any such substitution, the Company shall
be deemed to have made as to such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement except that all such
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed made
as of the date of such substitution. The Company shall effect such substitution
by delivering to the Custodian for such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan the
documents required by Section 2.03, with the Mortgage Note endorsed as required
by Section 2.03. No substitution will be made in any calendar month after the
Determination Date for such month. The Company shall deposit in the Custodial
Account the Monthly Payment less the Servicing Fee due on such Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans in the month following the date of such
substitution. Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loans in the month of substitution shall be retained by the Company. For the
month of substitution, distributions to Purchaser shall include the Monthly
Payment due on any Deleted Mortgage Loan in the month of substitution, and the
Company shall thereafter be entitled to retain all amounts subsequently received
by the Company in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan.


-31-





For any month in which the Company substitutes a Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, the Company shall
determine the amount (if any) by which the aggregate principal balance of all
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans as of the date of substitution is less than
the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of all Deleted Mortgage Loans (after
application of scheduled principal payments due in the month of substitution).
The amount of such shortfall shall be distributed by the Company in the month of
substitution pursuant to Section 5.01. Accordingly, on the date of such
substitution, the Company shall deposit from its own funds into the Custodial
Account an amount equal to the amount of such shortfall.


In addition to such repurchase or substitution obligation, the
Company shall indemnify the Purchaser and hold it harmless against any losses,
damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and
related costs, judgments, and other costs and expenses resulting from any claim,
demand, defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting from, a
Breach of the Company representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Company set
forth in this Section 3.03 to cure, substitute for or repurchase a defective
Mortgage Loan and to indemnify the Purchaser as provided in this Section 3.03
constitute the sole remedies of the Purchaser respecting a Breach of the
foregoing representations and warranties.


Any cause of action against the Company relating to or arising
out of the Breach of any representations and warranties made in Sections 3.01
and 3.02 shall accrue as to any Mortgage Loan upon (i) discovery of such Breach
by the Purchaser or notice thereof by the Company to the Purchaser, (ii)
failures by the Company to cure such Breach or repurchase such Mortgage Loan as
specified above, and (iii) demand upon the Company by the Purchaser for
compliance with this Agreement.


(b) With respect to any Mortgage Loan, if the related
Mortgagor has not made the Mortgage Loan's first or second Monthly Payment due
to the Purchaser after the related Closing Date within 30 days of its first Due
Date (a "First Payment Default"), the Company shall promptly repurchase such
Mortgage Loan from the Purchaser in accordance with Section 3.03(a) hereof.
Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser of the occurrence of a First Payment
Default.


Section 3.04 Restrictions and Requirements Applicable in the
Event that a Mortgage Loan is Acquired by a

REMIC.


In the event that any Mortgage Loan is held by a REMIC,
notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the following
provisions shall be applicable to such Mortgage Loan:


(A) Repurchase of Mortgage Loans.


With respect to any Mortgage Loan that is not in default or as
to which no default is imminent, no repurchase or substitution pursuant to
Subsection 3.03, 3.05 or 7.02 shall be made, unless, if so required by the
applicable REMIC Documents the Company has obtained an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such repurchase will not (i) result in the imposition of taxes on
"prohibited transactions" of such REMIC (as defined in Section 860F of the Code)
or otherwise subject the REMIC to tax, or (ii) cause the REMIC to fail to
qualify as a REMIC at any time.


-32-





(B) General Servicing Obligations.


The Company shall sell any REO Property within three years
after its acquisition by the REMIC unless (i) the Company applies for an
extension of such three-year period from the Internal Revenue Service pursuant
to the REMIC Provisions and Code Section 856(e)(3), in which event such REO
Property shall be sold within the applicable extension period, or (ii) the
Company obtains for the Purchaser an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to the
Purchaser and the Company, to the effect that the holding by the REMIC of such
REO Property subsequent to such three year period will not result in the
imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" as defined in Section 860F of
the Code or cause the REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the REMIC
Provisions or comparable provisions of relevant state laws at any time. The
Company shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO Property for the
Purchaser solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale in a manner
which does not cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure
property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) or result in the receipt by
the REMIC of any "income from non-permitted assets" within the meaning of

Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code or any "net income from foreclosure property"
which is subject to taxation under Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code. Pursuant to
its efforts to sell such REO Property, the Company shall either itself or
through an agent selected by the Company protect and conserve such REO Property
in the same manner and to such extent as is customary in the locality where such
REO Property is located and may, incident to its conservation and protection of
the interests of the Purchaser, rent the same, or any part thereof, as the
Company deems to be in the best interest of the Company and the Purchaser for
the period prior to the sale of such REO Property; provided, however, that any
rent received or accrued with respect to such REO Property qualifies as "rents
from real property" as defined in Section 856(d) of the Code.


(C) Additional Covenants.


In addition to the provision set forth in this Section 3.04,
if a REMIC election is made with respect to the arrangement under which any of
the Mortgage Loans or REO Properties are held, then, with respect to such
Mortgage Loans and/or REO Properties, and notwithstanding the terms of this
Agreement, the Company shall not take any action, cause the REMIC to take any
action or fail to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the
REMIC Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger
the status of the REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax
upon the REMIC (including but not limited to the tax on "prohibited
transactions" as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on
"contributions" to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code) unless the
Company has received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking
to take such action) to the effect that the contemplated action will not
endanger such REMIC status or result in the imposition of any such tax.


Subject to Section 7.01 of this Agreement, if a REMIC election
is made with respect to the arrangement under which any Mortgage Loans or REO
Properties are held, the Company shall amend this Agreement at the Purchaser's
expense such that it will meet all Rating Agency requirements.


-33-





Section 3.05 Review of Mortgage Loans.


To the extent provided for in the related Purchase Price and
Terms Letter, the Purchaser shall have the post-Closing Date right to review the
Mortgage Files and obtain BPOs on the Mortgaged Properties relating to the
Mortgage Loans to be purchased on the related Closing Date. In addition,
Purchaser shall have the right to reject any Mortgage Loan which in the
Purchaser's reasonable determination (i) fails to conform to Company's
Underwriting Guidelines, provided that with respect to Mortgage Loans which do
not conform with the Underwriting Guidelines, the Purchaser will review the
credit/risk profile of such Mortgage Loan to determine, in the Purchaser's sole
discretion, if there may be compensating factors present that would warrant the
acceptance of such Mortgage Loan, (ii) were underwritten without verification of
Mortgagor's income and assets (if so required under the applicable documentation
program) and there is no credit report and FICO Score on file, (iii) the value
of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to any BPO is less than 85% of the lesser of
(A) the original appraised value of the Mortgaged Property or (B) the purchase
price of the Mortgaged Property as of the date of origination or (iv) the
Purchaser does not deem the Mortgage Loan to be an acceptable credit risk. In
the event that the Purchaser so rejects any Mortgage Loan, the Company shall
repurchase the rejected Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price in the manner
prescribed in Section 3.03 upon receipt of notice from the Purchaser of the
rejection of such Mortgage Loan. Any rejected Mortgage Loan shall be removed
from the terms of this Agreement. The Company shall make available files
required by Purchaser in order to complete its review, including all CRA/HMDA
required data fields. To the extent that the Purchaser's review discloses that
the Mortgage Loans do not conform to the Underwriting Guidelines or the terms
set forth in the related Purchase Price and Terms Letter, the Purchaser may in
its sole discretion increase its due diligence review and obtain additional
BPO's or other property evaluations.



ARTICLE IV




ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS



Section 4.01 Company to Act as Servicer.


The Company, as an independent contractor, shall service and
administer the Mortgage Loans and shall have full power and authority, acting
alone, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which the Company may deem necessary or desirable, consistent
with the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted Servicing Practices.


-34-





Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Company may
waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the
postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant
indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Company's reasonable and prudent
determination such waiver, modification, postponement or indulgence is not
materially adverse to the Purchaser, provided, however, that (a) the Company
shall not make any future advances with respect to a Mortgage Loan and (unless
the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Mortgage Loan or such default
is, in the judgment of the Company, imminent and the Company has obtained the
prior written consent of the Purchaser) the Company shall not permit any
modification of any material term of any Mortgage Loan including any
modifications that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive the
payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the outstanding principal
balance (except for actual payments of principal) or change the final maturity
date on such Mortgage Loan and (b) the Company may not waive any prepayment
penalty unless such waiver would reduce the loss severity of a Mortgage Loan,
and (c) the Company may not waive any prepayment penalty for the refinancing of
a Mortgage Loan. In the event of any such modification which permits the
deferral of interest or principal payments on any Mortgage Loan, the Company
shall, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Remittance Date in any
month in which any such principal or interest payment has been deferred, deposit
in the Custodial Account from its own funds, in accordance with Section 5.03,
the difference between (a) such month's principal and one month's interest at
the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid principal balance of such
Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by the Mortgagor. The Company shall be
entitled to reimbursement for such advances to the same extent as for all other
advances made pursuant to Section 5.03. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered,
to execute and deliver on behalf of itself and the Purchasers, all instruments
of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and
all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with
respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If reasonably required by the Company, the
Purchaser shall furnish the Company with any powers of attorney and other
documents necessary or appropriate to enable the Company to carry out its
servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement.


In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Company
shall employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same
care that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering
mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted
Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the requirements
of this Agreement, and the Purchaser's reliance on the Company.


Section 4.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans.


In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan and
not postponed pursuant to Section 4.01 is not paid when the same becomes due and
payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails to perform any other covenant or
obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period, the Company shall take such action as (1) the Company
would take under similar circumstances with respect to a similar mortgage loan
held for its own account for investment, (2) shall be consistent with Accepted
Servicing Practices, (3) the Company shall determine prudently to be in the best
interest of Purchaser, and (4) is consistent with any related PMI Policy. In the
event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not postponed pursuant to

Section 4.01 and remains delinquent for a period of 90 days or any other default
continues for a period of 90 days beyond the expiration of any grace or cure
period, the Company shall commence foreclosure proceedings, provided that, prior
to commencing foreclosure proceedings, the Company shall notify the Purchaser in
writing of the Company's intention to do so, and the Company shall not commence
foreclosure proceedings if the Purchaser objects to such action within 10
Business Days of receiving such notice and following such objection, the Company
shall have no obligation to make Monthly Advances with respect to such Mortgage
Loan. In such connection, the Company shall from its own funds make all
necessary and proper Servicing Advances, provided, however, that the Company
shall not be required to expend its own funds in connection with any foreclosure
or towards the restoration or preservation of any Mortgaged Property, unless it
shall determine (a) that such preservation, restoration and/or foreclosure will
increase the proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Purchaser after
reimbursement to itself for such expenses and (b) that such expenses will be
recoverable by it either through Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall
have priority for purposes of withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to

Section 4.05) or through Insurance Proceeds (respecting which it shall have
similar priority).


-35-





Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, in
the event the Company has reasonable cause to believe that a Mortgaged Property
is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, or if the Purchaser
otherwise requests an environmental inspection or review of such Mortgaged
Property to be conducted by a qualified inspector. Upon completion of the
inspection, the Company shall promptly provide the Purchaser with a written
report of the environmental inspection.


After reviewing the environmental inspection report, the
Purchaser shall determine how the Company shall proceed with respect to the
Mortgaged Property. In the event (a) the environmental inspection report
indicates that the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic
substances or wastes and (b) the Purchaser directs the Company to proceed with
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Company shall be
reimbursed for all reasonable costs associated with such foreclosure or
acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure and any related environmental clean
up costs, as applicable, from the related Liquidation Proceeds, or if the
Liquidation Proceeds are insufficient to fully reimburse the Company, the
Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed from amounts in the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof. In the event the Purchaser directs the Company
not to proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
the Company shall be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances made with respect to
the related Mortgaged Property from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section
4.05 hereof.


Section 4.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.


Continuously from the date hereof until the principal and
interest on all Mortgage Loans are paid in full, the Company shall proceed
diligently to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans when the
same shall become due and payable and shall ascertain and estimate Escrow
Payments and all other charges that will become due and payable with respect to
the Mortgage Loan and the Mortgaged Property, to the end that the installments
payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to pay such charges as and when
they become due and payable.


Section 4.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial
Account.


The Company shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its own
funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial
Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled "IndyMac Bank,
FSB in trust for the Purchaser of Conventional Residential Conventional
Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, Group No. 2003-1 and
various Mortgagors". The Custodial Account shall be established with a Qualified
Depository acceptable to the Purchaser. Any funds deposited in the Custodial
Account shall at all times be fully insured to the full extent permitted under
applicable law. Funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be drawn on by the
Company in accordance with Section 4.05. The creation of any Custodial Account
shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit D-1 hereto, in the
case of an account established with the Company, or by a letter agreement in the
form of Exhibit D-2 hereto, in the case of an account held by a depository other
than the Company. A copy of such certification or letter agreement shall be
furnished to the Purchaser and, upon request, to any subsequent Purchaser.


-36-





The Company shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily
basis, and retain therein, the following collections received by the Company and
payments made by the Company after the related Cut-off Date, other than payments
of principal and interest due on or before the related Cut-off Date, or received
by the Company prior to the related Cut-off Date but allocable to a period
subsequent thereto:


(i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage
Loans, including all Principal Prepayments;


(ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;


(iii) all Liquidation Proceeds;


(iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to be
deposited pursuant to Section 4.10 (other than proceeds to be held in
the Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the
Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with

Section 4.14), Section 4.11 and Section 4.15;


(v) all Condemnation Proceeds which are not applied to the
restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the
Mortgagor in accordance with Section 4.14;


(vi) any amount required to be deposited in the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 4.01, 4.09, 5.03, 6.01 or 6.02;


(vii) any amounts payable in connection with the repurchase of
any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 3.03, 3.05 or 3.06 and all
amounts required to be deposited by the Company in connection with a
shortfall in principal amount of any Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan
pursuant to Section 3.03;


(viii) with respect to each Principal Prepayment in full or in
part, the Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, if any, for the month
of distribution. Such deposit shall be made from the Company's own
funds, without reimbursement therefor up to a maximum amount per month

Property and all REO Disposition Proceeds pursuant to Section 4.16.


The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial
Account shall be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of late payment
charges and assumption fees, to the extent permitted by Section 6.01, need not

Company's right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to the

Account except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 5.01, the Company is
not obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Company may use such
withdrawn funds only for the purposes described in this Section 4.05.


Section 4.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account.


The Company shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and
apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and
maintain one or more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand
accounts, titled, "IndyMac Bank, FSB, in trust for the Purchaser of Conventional
Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, Group No. 2003-1, and
various Mortgagors". The Escrow Accounts shall be established with a Qualified
Depository, in a manner which shall provide maximum available insurance
thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow Account may be drawn on by the Company
in accordance with Section 4.07. The creation of any Escrow Account shall be
evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit E-1 hereto, in the case of
an account established with the Company, or by a letter agreement in the form of
Exhibit E-2 hereto, in the case of an account held by a depository other than
the Company. A copy of such certification shall be furnished to the Purchaser
and, upon request, to any subsequent Purchaser.


The Company shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts on
a daily basis, and retain therein:


(i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage
Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as
required under the terms of this Agreement; and


(ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or
repair of any Mortgaged Property.


The Company shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account
only to effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth
in Section 4.07. The Company shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on
funds deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than
interest on escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the
extent required by law, the Company shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the
Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or
that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.


-39-





Section 4.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.


Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by
the Company only:


(i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes,
assessments, water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium
charges, fire and hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting
Escrow Payments for the related Mortgage;


(ii) to reimburse the Company for any Servicing Advances made
by the Company pursuant to Section 4.08 with respect to a related
Mortgage Loan, but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage
Loan which represent late collections of Escrow Payments thereunder;


(iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in
excess of the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage
Loan;


(iv) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application to

Account;


(vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the
termination of this Agreement; and


(viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.


Section 4.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.


With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Company shall maintain
accurate records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
water rates, sewer rents, and other charges which are or may become a lien upon
the Mortgaged Property and the status of PMI Policy premiums and fire and hazard
insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to time, all bills for the
payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and shall effect payment
thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination date, employing for such
purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account which shall have been
estimated and accumulated by the Company in amounts sufficient for such
purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. To the extent that a
Mortgage does not provide for Escrow Payments, the Company shall determine that
any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they first become due.
The Company assumes full responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills
and shall effect timely payment of all such charges irrespective of each
Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the
Escrow Payments, and the Company shall make advances from its own funds to
effect such payments; provided, that the Seller shall not be required to make
any Nonrecoverable Advance. In the event that the Seller determines that any
advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Seller shall promptly deliver to
the Purchaser notification of such determination, accompanies by an officer's
certificate of the Seller setting forth the reason such advance is determined to
be nonrecoverable. Upon liquidations of a Mortgage Loan, if the Liquidation
Proceeds are insufficient to reimburse the Seller for any Nonrecoverable
Advances made, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for such shortfall.


-40-





Section 4.09 Protection of Accounts.


The Company may transfer the Custodial Account or the Escrow
Account to a different Qualified Depository from time to time. Such transfer
shall be made only upon obtaining the consent of the Purchaser, which consent
shall not be withheld unreasonably.


The Company shall bear any expenses, losses or damages
sustained by the Purchaser because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow
Account are not demand deposit accounts.


Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow
Account may at the option of the Company be invested in Eligible Investments;
provided that in the event that amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or
the Escrow Account exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the "Insured
Amount") the Company shall be obligated to invest the excess amount over the
Insured Amount in Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such excess
amount becomes present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account. Any such
Eligible Investment shall mature no later than the Business Day prior to the
Remittance Date next following the date of such Eligible Investment, provided,
however, that if such Eligible Investment is an obligation of a Qualified
Depository (other than the Company) that maintains the Custodial Account or the
Escrow Account, then such Eligible Investment may mature on such Remittance
Date. Any such Eligible Investment shall be made in the name of the Company in
trust for the benefit of the Purchaser. All income on or gain realized from any
such Eligible Investment shall be for the benefit of the Company and may be
withdrawn at any time by the Company. Any losses incurred in respect of any such
investment shall be deposited in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by
the Company out of its own funds immediately as realized.


Section 4.10 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.


The Company shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage
Loan hazard insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are
insured by a Qualified Insurer against loss by fire, hazards of extended
coverage and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged
Property is located, in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i)
the replacement value of the improvements securing such Mortgage Loan and (ii)
the greater of (a) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and

(b) an amount such that the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the
Mortgagor or the loss payee from becoming a co-insurer.


-41-





If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related
Mortgaged Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by
the Flood Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such
flood insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a Qualified Insurer in an amount representing coverage equal
to the lesser of (i) the minimum amount required, under the terms of coverage,
to compensate for any damage or loss on a replacement cost basis (or the unpaid
balance of the mortgage if replacement cost coverage is not available for the
type of building insured) and (ii) the maximum amount of insurance which is
available under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any
time during the term of the Mortgage Loan, the Company determines in accordance
with applicable law and pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged
Property is located in a special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood
insurance or is covered in an amount less than the amount required by the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, the Company shall notify the
related Mortgagor that the Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage,
and if said Mortgagor fails to obtain the required flood insurance coverage
within forty-five (45) days after such notification, the Company shall
immediately force place the required flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.


If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project,
the Company shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association,
including hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained
in accordance with then current Fannie Mae requirements, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Company promptly of any change
in the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have
a material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.


The Company shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged
Property earthquake or such other or additional insurance as may be required
pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in
force and as shall require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the
requirements of any private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to
conform with Accepted Servicing Practices.


In the event that any Purchaser or the Company shall determine
that the Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards
and risks not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the
Mortgagor pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, the Company shall communicate
and consult with the Mortgagor with respect to the need for such insurance and
bring to the Mortgagor's attention the desirability of protection of the
Mortgaged Property.


All policies required hereunder shall name the Company as loss
payee and shall be endorsed with standard or union mortgagee clauses, without
contribution, which shall provide for at least 30 days prior written notice of
any cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage.


-42-





The Company shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom
of choice in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however,
that the Company shall only accept any such insurance policies from Qualified
Insurers licensed to do business in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged
Property is located. The Company shall determine that such policies provide
sufficient risk coverage and amounts, that they insure the property owner, and
that they properly describe the property address. The Company shall furnish to
the Mortgagor a formal notice of expiration of any such insurance in sufficient
time for the Mortgagor to arrange for renewal coverage by the expiration date.


Pursuant to Section 4.04, any amounts collected by the Company
under any such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow
Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged
Property, or property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be
released to the Mortgagor, in accordance with the Company's normal servicing
procedures as specified in Section 4.14) shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 4.05.


Section 4.11 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance.


In the event that the Company shall obtain and maintain a
blanket policy insuring against losses arising from fire and hazards covered
under extended coverage on all of the Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such
policy provides coverage in an amount equal to the amount required pursuant to

Section 4.10 and otherwise complies with all other requirements of Section 4.10,
it shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth
in Section 4.10. Any amounts collected by the Company under any such policy
relating to a Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject
to withdrawal pursuant to Section 4.05. Such policy may contain a deductible
clause, in which case, in the event that there shall not have been maintained on
the related Mortgaged Property a policy complying with Section 4.10, and there
shall have been a loss which would have been covered by such policy, the Company
shall deposit in the Custodial Account at the time of such loss the amount not
otherwise payable under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause,
such amount to deposited from the Company's funds, without reimbursement
therefor. Upon request of any Purchaser, the Company shall cause to be delivered
to such Purchaser a certificate of insurance setting forth the related coverage.


Section 4.12 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance.


The Company shall maintain with responsible companies, at its
own expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance
Policy, with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting
in any capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or
papers relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Company Employees"). Any such Fidelity
Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the
Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Company against
losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Company Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the Company against
losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No
provision of this Section 4.12 requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Company from its duties
and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage under any
such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal to the corresponding
amounts required by Fannie Mae in the Fannie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities
Selling and Servicing Guide or by Freddie Mac in the Freddie Mac Sellers' &
Servicers' Guide. Upon the request of any Purchaser, the Company shall cause to
be delivered to such Purchaser a certified true copy of such fidelity bond and
insurance policy, or a certificate of insurance setting forth the related
coverage, and a statement from the surety and the insurer that such fidelity
bond and insurance policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified
without 30 days' prior written notice to the Purchaser.


-43-





Section 4.13 Inspections.


The Company shall inspect the Mortgaged Property as often as
deemed necessary by the Company to assure itself that the value of the Mortgaged
Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage Loan is more than 60
days delinquent, the Company immediately shall inspect the Mortgaged Property
and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with Accepted Servicing
Practices or as may be required by the primary mortgage guaranty insurer. The
Company shall keep a written report of each such inspection.


Section 4.14 Restoration of Mortgaged Property.


The Company need not obtain the approval of the Purchaser
prior to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the
Mortgagor to be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property
if such release is in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. At a
minimum, the Company shall comply with the following conditions in connection
with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds:


(i) the Company shall receive satisfactory independent
verification of completion of repairs and issuance of any required
approvals with respect thereto;


(ii) the Company shall take all steps necessary to preserve
the priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;


(iii) the Company shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is not
in default; and


(iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Company shall place
the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.


If the Purchaser is named as an additional loss payee, the
Company is hereby empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such
a claim in the name of the Purchaser.


-44-





Section 4.15 Maintenance of PMI Policy; Claims.


(a) With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Company shall,
without any cost to the Purchaser, maintain or cause the Mortgagor to maintain
in full force and effect a PMI Policy conforming to Fannie Mae requirements, and
shall pay or shall cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a timely
basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the event that
such PMI Policy shall be terminated, the Company shall obtain from another
Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage equal
to the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy. If the insurer shall
cease to be a Qualified Insurer, the Company shall determine whether recoveries
under the PMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial
condition of such insurer, it being understood that the Company shall in no
event have any responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under the
PMI Policy for such reason. If the Company determines that recoveries are so
jeopardized, it shall notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor, if required, and
obtain from another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance policy. The
Company shall not take any action which would result in noncoverage under any
applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the Company
would have been covered thereunder. In connection with any assumption or
substitution agreement entered into or to be entered into pursuant to Section
6.01, the Company shall promptly notify the insurer under the related PMI
Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of liability in accordance
with the terms of such PMI Policy and shall take all actions which may be
required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation of coverage under
such PMI Policy. If such PMI Policy is terminated as a result of such assumption
or substitution of liability, the Company shall obtain a replacement PMI Policy
as provided above.


(b) With respect to each Mortgage Loan the Company shall
maintain in full force and effect any LPMI Policy, and from time to time,
withdraw the premium with respect to such Mortgage Loans from the Custodial
Account in order to pay the premium thereon on a timely basis. In the event that
the interest payments made with respect to the Mortgage Loan are less than the
premium with respect to the LPMI Policy, the Company shall advance from its own
funds the amount of any such shortfall in the LPMI Policy premiums, in payment
of such premium. Any such advance shall be a Servicing Advance subject to
reimbursement pursuant to the provisions on Section 4.05. In the event that such
LPMI Policy shall be terminated, the Company shall obtain from another Qualified
Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage equal to the
remaining coverage of such terminated LPMI Policy, at substantially the same fee
level. If the insurer shall cease to be a Qualified Insurer, the Company shall
determine whether recoveries under the LPMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons
related to the financial condition of such insurer, it being understood that the
Company shall in no event have any responsibility or liability for any failure
to recover under the LPMI Policy for such reason. If the Company determines that
recoveries are so jeopardized, it shall notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor,
if required, and obtain from another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance
policy. The Company shall not take any action which would result in noncoverage
under any applicable LPMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the
Company would have been covered thereunder. In connection with any assumption or
substitution agreement entered into or to be entered into pursuant to Section
4.01, the Company shall promptly notify the insurer under the related LPMI
Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of liability in accordance
with the terms of such LPMI Policy and shall take all actions which may be
required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation of coverage under
such LPMI Policy. If such LPMI Policy is terminated as a result of such
assumption or substitution of liability, the Company shall obtain a replacement
LPMI Policy as provided above.


-45-





(c) Purchaser, in its sole discretion, at any time, may (i)
either obtain an additional LPMI Policy on any Mortgage Loan which already has
an LPMI Policy in place, or (ii) obtain a LPMI Policy for any Mortgage Loan
which does not already have a LPMI Policy in place. In any event, the Company
agrees to administer such LPMI Policies in accordance with the Agreement or any
Reconstitution Agreement.


(d) In connection with its activities as servicer, the Company
agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Purchaser, claims to
the insurer under any PMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the
terms of such PMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action as shall be
necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy respecting a defaulted
Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to Section 4.04, any amounts collected by the Company
under any PMI Policy shall be deposited in the Custodial Account, subject to
withdrawal pursuant to Section 4.05.


Section 4.16 Title, Management and Disposition of REO
Property.


In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired
in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of
sale shall be taken in the name of the Purchaser or as the Purchaser shall
direct.


The Company shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
REO Property for the Purchaser solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition
and sale. The Company, either itself or through an agent selected by the
Company, shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the
same manner that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed
property for its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in
the same locality as the REO Property is managed. The Company shall attempt to
sell the same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than
one year, except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as
the Company deems to be in the best interest of the Purchaser.


The Company shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO
Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event
within three years after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless (i)
(A) a REMIC election has not been made with respect to the arrangement under
which the Mortgage Loans and the REO Property are held, and (ii) the Company
determines, and gives an appropriate notice to the Purchaser to such effect,
that a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such REO
Property. If a period longer than one year is permitted under the foregoing
sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Company shall report
monthly to the Purchaser as to the progress being made in selling such REO
Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Purchaser, a purchase
money mortgage is taken in connection with such sale, such purchase money
mortgage shall name the Company as mortgagee, and such purchase money mortgage
shall not be held pursuant to this Agreement, but instead a separate
participation agreement among the Company and Purchaser shall be entered into
with respect to such purchase money mortgage.


The Company shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and
hazard insurance with extended coverage in amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.


-46-





The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
Company at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Company deems
to be in the best interests of the Purchaser. The proceeds of sale of the REO
Property shall be promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as
practical thereafter the expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Company
shall reimburse itself for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid
Servicing Fees and unreimbursed advances made pursuant to Section 5.03, and on
the Remittance Date immediately following the Principal Prepayment Period in
which such sale proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such sale
remaining in the Custodial Account shall be distributed to the Purchaser.


The Company shall withdraw the Custodial Account funds
necessary for the proper operation, management and maintenance of the REO
Property, including the cost of maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to

Section 4.10 and the fees of any managing agent of the Company or the Company
itself. The REO management fee shall be an amount that is reasonable and
customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located. The Company shall
make monthly distributions on each Remittance Date to the Purchasers of the net
cash flow from the REO Property (which shall equal the revenues from such REO
Property net of the expenses described in the Section 4.16 and of any reserves
reasonably required from time to time to be maintained to satisfy anticipated
liabilities for such expenses).


Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to
time, the Purchaser may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to
one or more REO Properties as provided by Section 11.02.


Section 4.17 Real Estate Owned Reports.


Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section
5.02, the Company shall furnish to the Purchaser on or before the Remittance
Date each month a statement with respect to any REO Property covering the
operation of such REO Property for the previous month and the Company's efforts
in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any rental of such REO
Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous month. That statement
shall be accompanied by such other information as the Purchaser shall reasonably
request.


Section 4.18 Liquidation Reports.


Upon the foreclosure sale of any Mortgaged Property or the
acquisition thereof by the Purchaser pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
the Company shall submit to the Purchaser a liquidation report with respect to
such Mortgaged Property.


Section 4.19 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of
Mortgaged Property.


Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Company shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.


-47-





Section 4.20 Notification of Adjustments.


With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Company shall adjust
the Mortgage Interest Rate on the related Interest Rate Adjustment Date in
compliance with the requirements of applicable law and the related Mortgage and
Mortgage Note. The Company shall execute and deliver any and all necessary
notices required under applicable law and the terms of the related Mortgage Note
and Mortgage regarding the Mortgage Interest Rate adjustments. The Company shall
promptly, upon written request therefor, deliver to the Purchaser such
notifications and any additional applicable data regarding such adjustments and
the methods used to calculate and implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery
by the Company or the receipt of notice from the Purchaser that the Company has
failed to adjust a Mortgage Interest Rate in accordance with the terms of the
related Mortgage Note, the Company shall immediately deposit in the Custodial
Account from its own funds the amount of any interest loss or deferral caused
the Purchaser thereby.


Section 4.21 Credit Reporting


For each Mortgage Loan, the Company shall accurately and fully
furnish, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing
regulations, accurate and complete information on its borrower credit files to

with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such
interest shall be remitted along with the distribution payable on the next

Section 5.02 Statements to Purchaser.


Not later than the 10th calendar day of the month (or if such
day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately following such 10th

with a trial balance report attached thereto, in the form of Exhibit F annexed

calendar year, the Company shall furnish to each Person who was a Purchaser at
any time during such calendar year an annual statement in accordance with the

Code as from time to time are in force.


At the Purchaser's expense, the Company shall provide any and
all information necessary for the preparation and filing of tax returns,

month, including Mortgage Loans permitting semi-annual amortization of
principal, shall be accounted for as described in this Section 5.04. Any payment
due on a day other than the first day of each month shall be considered due on
the first day of the month in which that payment is due as if such payment were
due on the first day of said month. For example, a payment due on August 15
shall be considered to be due on August 1 of said month. With respect to a
Mortgage Note permitting semi-annual amortization of principal, the Company

monthly amortization schedule. Any payment collected on a Mortgage Loan after
the related Cut-off Date shall be deposited in the Custodial Account. For

GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES



Section 6.01 Transfers of Mortgaged Property.


The Company shall use its best efforts to enforce any
"due-on-sale" provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny
assumption by the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to
be sold whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or
not the Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Company shall, to the
extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate
the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause applicable
thereto, provided, however, that the Company shall not exercise such rights if
prohibited by law from doing so or if the exercise of such rights would impair
or threaten to impair any recovery under the related PMI Policy.


If the Company reasonably believes it is unable under
applicable law to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Company shall enter
into (i) an assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such
property has been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under
the Mortgage Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in
the event the Company is unable under applicable law to require that the
original Mortgagor remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Company has the
prior consent of the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of
liability agreement with the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to
which the original Mortgagor is released from liability and the purchaser of the
Mortgaged Property is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the
Mortgage Note. If an assumption fee is collected by the Company for entering
into an assumption agreement, such fee will be retained by the Company as
additional servicing compensation. In connection with any such assumption,
neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne by the related Mortgage Note, the term
of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding principal amount of the Mortgage Loan
shall be changed.


-50-





To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the Company
shall inquire diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee,
and shall use the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of the proposed
transferee which are used by Fannie Mae with respect to underwriting mortgage
loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. If the credit of the proposed
transferee does not meet such underwriting criteria, the Company diligently
shall, to the extent permitted by the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and by
applicable law, accelerate the maturity of the Mortgage Loan.


Section 6.02 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage
Files.


Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt
by the Company of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a
manner customary for such purposes, the Company shall notify the Purchaser in
the Monthly Remittance Advice as provided in Section 5.02, and may request the
release of any Mortgage Loan Documents.


If the Company satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or
should the Company otherwise prejudice any rights the Purchaser may have under
the mortgage instruments, upon written demand of the Purchaser, the Company
shall repurchase the related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price by deposit
thereof in the Custodial Account within 2 Business Days of receipt of such
demand by the Purchaser. The Company shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors
and Omissions Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 4.12 insuring the
Company against any loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not
satisfied in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.


Section 6.03 Servicing Compensation.


As compensation for its services hereunder, the Company shall
be entitled to withdraw from the Custodial Account or to retain from interest
payments on the Mortgage Loans the amount of its Servicing Fee. The Servicing
Fee shall be payable monthly and shall be computed on the basis of the same
unpaid principal balance and for the period respecting which any related
interest payment on a Mortgage Loan is computed. The Servicing Fee shall be
payable only at the time of and with respect to those Mortgage Loans for which
payment is in fact made of the entire amount of the Monthly Payment. The
obligation of the Purchaser to pay the Servicing Fee is limited to, and payable
solely from, the interest portion of such Monthly Payments collected by the
Company.


Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption
fees, and late payment charges shall be retained by the Company to the extent
not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account. The Company shall be
required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing
activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement thereof except
as specifically provided for herein; provided , that the Seller shall not be
required to make any Nonrecoverable Advance. In the event that the Seller
determines that any advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Seller shall
promptly deliver to the Purchaser notification of such determination,
accompanied by an officer's certificate of the Seller setting forth the reason
such advance is determined to be nonrecoverable.

Section 6.04 Annual Statement as to Compliance.


The Company shall deliver to the Purchaser, on or before March
31 each year beginning March 31, 2004, an Officer's Certificate, stating that

(i) a review of the activities of the Company during the preceding calendar year
and of performance under this Agreement has been made under such officer's
supervision, and (ii) the Company has complied fully with the provisions of
Article II and Article IV, and (iii) to the best of such officer's knowledge,
based on such review, the Company has fulfilled all its obligations under this
Agreement throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the
fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such
officer and the nature and status thereof and the action being taken by the
Company to cure such default.


Section 6.05 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
Report.


On or before March 31st of each year beginning March 31, 2004,
the Company, at its expense, shall cause a firm of independent public
accountants which is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants to furnish a statement to each Purchaser to the effect that such
firm has examined certain documents and records relating to the servicing of the
Mortgage Loans and this Agreement and that such firm is of the opinion that the
provisions of Article II and Article IV have been complied with, and that, on
the basis of such examination conducted substantially in compliance with the
Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers, nothing has come to their
attention which would indicate that such servicing has not been conducted in
compliance therewith, except for (i) such exceptions as such firm shall believe
to be immaterial, and (ii) such other exceptions as shall be set forth in such
statement.


Section 6.06 Right to Examine Company Records.


The Purchaser shall have the right to examine and audit any
and all of the books, records, or other information of the Company, whether held
by the Company or by another on its behalf, with respect to or concerning this
Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, during business hours or at such other times as
may be reasonable under applicable circumstances, upon reasonable advance
notice.

PASS-THROUGH TRANSFER



Section 7.01 Removal of Mortgage Loans from Inclusion Under
this Agreement Upon a Pass-Through Transfer
on One or More Reconstitution Dates.


The Purchaser and the Company agree that with respect to some
or all of the Mortgage Loans, from time to time the Purchaser shall effect a
Whole Loan Transfer, a Pass-Through Transfer or an Agency Transfer, retaining
the Company as the servicer thereof, or as applicable the "seller/servicer". On
the related Reconstitution Date, the Mortgage Loans transferred shall cease to
be covered by this Agreement.


-52-





The Company shall cooperate with the Purchaser in connection
with any Transfer contemplated by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.01.
In that connection, the Company shall (a) execute any Reconstitution Agreement
within a reasonable period of time after receipt of any Reconstitution Agreement
which time shall be sufficient for the Company and Company's counsel to review
such Reconstitution Agreement, but such time shall not exceed ten (10) Business
Days after such receipt, and (b) provide to the trustee or a third party
purchaser, subject to any Reconstitution Agreement and/or the Purchaser: (i) any
and all information and appropriate verification of information which may be
reasonably available to the Company, whether through letters of its auditors
(the reasonable out-of-pocket cost of which shall be borne by the Purchaser) and
counsel or otherwise, as the Purchaser shall reasonably request; (ii) restate
each of the representations and warranties set forth in the Section 3.01 as of
the Closing Date, and (iii) such additional representations, warranties,
covenants, opinions of counsel, letters from auditors, and certificates of
public officials or officers of the Company as are reasonably believed necessary
by the trustee, such third party purchaser, any master servicer, any rating
agency or the Purchaser, as the case may be, in connection with such
transactions; provided, however, that these items shall not be more onerous than
such similar items set forth herein.


The Assignments of Mortgage are generally required to be
recorded by or on behalf of the Company in the appropriate offices for real
property records; provided however, the Company shall not cause to be recorded
any Assignment which relates to a Mortgage Loan in a jurisdiction where either
the Rating Agencies (in the case of Agency or Pass-Through Transfers) or
purchasers (in the case of Whole Loan Transfers) do not require recordation;
provided further, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of
certain events set forth in the pooling agreement (in the case of and Agency or
Pass-Through Transfer), each such assignment of Mortgage shall be recorded by
the master servicer or the trustee as set forth in the Reconstitution Agreement.
Any costs associated with the recording of such Assignments of Mortgage and
other relevant documents will be borne by the Company. In the event that
Purchaser sells any Mortgage Loans in a Whole Loan Transfer and the subsequent
purchaser requests recorded Assignments of Mortgage, the Company, shall at its
expense cause to be recorded any Assignments of Mortgage.


All Mortgage Loans not sold or transferred pursuant to a
Pass-Through Transfer and any Mortgage Loans repurchased by the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 7.02 hereof, shall be subject to this Agreement and shall
continue to be serviced in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and with
respect thereto this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.


The Purchaser shall pay the Seller's reasonable legal fees for
the review of any matters related to a Transfer or Reconstitution Agreement and
shall reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with entering into any Reconstitution Agreement.

contained in any Reconstitution Agreement or a request by Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac or the trustee, as the case may be, for the repurchase of any Mortgage Loan
transferred to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac pursuant to an Agency Transfer or to a
trustee pursuant to a Pass-Through Transfer, the Company shall promptly notify
the Purchaser of same and shall, at the direction of the Purchaser, use its best
efforts to cure and correct any such breach and to satisfy the requests or
concerns of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the trustee related to such deficiencies
of the related Mortgage Loans transferred to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the
trustee.


The Purchaser shall repurchase from the Company any Mortgage
Loan transferred to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac pursuant to an Agency Transfer or
to a trustee pursuant to a Pass-Through Transfer with respect to which the
Company has been required by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the trustee to
repurchase due to a breach of a representation or warranty made by the Purchaser
with respect to the Mortgage Loans, or the servicing thereof prior to the
transfer date to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the trustee in any Reconstitution
Agreement and not due to a breach of the Company's representations or
obligations thereunder or pursuant to this Agreement. The repurchase price to be
paid by the Purchaser to the Company shall equal that repurchase price paid by
the Company to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the third party purchaser plus all
reasonable costs and expenses borne by the Company in connection with the cure
of said breach of a representation or warranty made by the Purchaser and in
connection with the repurchase of such Mortgage Loan from Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, or the trustee, including, but not limited to, reasonable and necessary
attorneys' fees.


At the time of repurchase, the Custodian and the Company shall
arrange for the reassignment of the repurchased Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser
according to the Purchaser's instructions and the delivery to the Custodian of
any documents held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the trustee with respect to
the repurchased Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Reconstitution Agreement.
In the event of a repurchase, the Company shall, simultaneously with such
reassignment, give written notice to the Purchaser that such repurchase has
taken place, and amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the addition of the
repurchased Mortgage Loan to this Agreement. In connection with any such
addition, the Company and the Purchaser shall be deemed to have made as to such
repurchased Mortgage Loan the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement except that all such representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed made as of the Closing Date.

consolidation to which the Company shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to
the business of the Company, shall be the successor of the Company hereunder,

Section 9.04 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by

and subsequent Purchasers will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the

such determination permitting the resignation of the Company shall be evidenced
by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Purchaser which Opinion
of Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Purchaser. No such
resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the

(iii) failure by the Company to maintain a license to do
business in any jurisdiction where a Mortgage Property is located and

(iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory
authority having jurisdiction for the appointment of a conservator or
receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
including bankruptcy, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar
proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall
have been entered against the Company and such decree or order shall
have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60
days; or


(v) the Company shall consent to the appointment of a
conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of
or relating to the Company or of or relating to all or substantially
all of its property; or


(vi) the Company shall admit in writing its inability to pay
its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take
advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization

the Purchaser, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
of its property or assets or to assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or to delegate its duties hereunder or any
portion thereof in violation of Section 9.04.


In each and every such case, so long as an Event of Default
shall not have been remedied, in addition to whatsoever rights the Purchaser may
have at law or equity to damages, including injunctive relief and specific
performance, the Purchaser, by notice in writing to the Company, and subject to
the succeeding sentence, may terminate all the rights and obligations of the
Company under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds
thereof; provided that, the Company, within 60 days following receipt of such
notice from the Purchaser, shall have the right to deliver to the Purchaser, a
firm written commitment by a third party servicer (an "Acceptable Commitment"),
which commitment is in form and substance acceptable to the Purchaser in its
sole discretion, to purchase the servicing rights and assume the servicing
obligations hereunder and under any Reconstitution Agreement related to any of
the Mortgage Loans; provided further that such third party servicer (i) is
acceptable to the Purchaser in its sole discretion, and (ii) by replacing the
Company as servicer, will not cause a downgrade by any Rating Agency rating the
