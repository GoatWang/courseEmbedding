Beautify your home with the latest lawn and garden equipment from Sears 
Taking care of your garden or yard can be a tough task, but the right lawn and garden equipment can save on time and energy with great results. Whether you're looking to just cut the grass and clear weeds or clean up snow in the winter, Sears has all the supplies that you need to complete any task with confidence. You'll be able to stock your garden shed with high-quality mowers, chainsaws and much more. 
Choosing the right landscaping tools depends solely on your requirements. A lawn mower is a great way to keep your grass well kempt throughout the year. You can minimize physical labor with a standard or zero-turn tractor. This machine comfortably maneuvers around tight obstacles and can tackle large pieces of property. When your bushes or trees start to get unwieldy, a pole saw or trimmer can give shrubbery and branches a pristine look in a matter of moments. 
Aside from traditional gardening tools, you should also have enough supplies for the winter. Shovels are ideal for smaller properties, and the latest electric and gas snow blowers allow you to clear heavy snow and ice from large driveways with ease. No matter what task is at hand, different accessories can maintain and enhance your outdoor space. Enjoy a beautiful home with high quality lawn and garden equipment from Sears.

Quality Tools Help You Get the Job Done Quickly
Fill your toolbox with durable and quality tools and sets from Sears. From Craftsman power tools to manual hand tools, Sears gives you access to the tools you need for almost any job. Repair the bathroom plumbing with Empire and Imperial pipe and tube cutters, and keep the car running its best when you use Craftsman mechanics tool sets and auto specialty tools. From DIY jobs to professional contract work, you can find the tools you need at Sears.
For automotive work such as changing tires or replacing a battery, you need quality air tools and compressors. Craftsman and Ingersoll-Rand are just two name brands that feature high-quality impact wrenches for loosening and tightening lug nuts. In addition, choose from 10-piece 1/2-inch Craftsman Evolv deep impact socket sets for work in the garage. Whether you've suffered a flat tire while traveling or need a quality tool for auto repair work at the shop, find the tools you need to make light work of any repair job.
For woodworking or metal work, Craftsman and DeWalt drills give you the power you need to drill through almost any surface. Furthermore, corded and cordless drills are available depending on your particular need. For more freedom of movement on the jobsite, DeWalt features a heavy-duty cordless drill complete with keyless ratcheting and dual speeds. The Craftsman 3/8-inch reversible corded drill features the power you need but with a lightweight, ergonomic design for complete comfort as you work.
Whether it's a socket set or a compact drill, you need a place to store and organize your tools. With tool chest combos from Craftsman and International, you have plenty of storage space for everything in the workshop. Smaller toolboxes are ideal for transporting your tools from the garage to the jobsite, but Craftsman 42-inch tool storage towers offer high-quality alternatives to smaller boxes and chests. Select from five-drawer tool centers complete with drawer slides and wheels for easy transport throughout the workshop. Moreover, tool chest combos support up to 300 pounds or more, so you can store much heavier tools such as power saws and 100-piece mechanic sets.
From professional Craftsman tools to high-quality tool chests, you have access to everything you need for DIY or professional work. Shop Sears online or at the store for more affordable power tools and durable tool chests.

Humidification Systems






When you hire Sears HVAC installation experts to install* a whole house air conditioner, furnace, or other HVAC unit, we take these steps to ensure you get the right product for your home.
We determine your home’s HVAC needs
To make sure the unit you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load calculation estimate to determine the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that’s just right for your home–we don’t just replace it with the same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the unit isn’t too small or too large–both waste energy.
We use current air conditioner refrigerant technology
We only install air conditioners with R410A refrigerant. Unlike R-22 refrigerant–which is being phased out–R410A refrigerant doesn’t deplete the ozone layer. And R410A refrigerant makes air conditioners more efficient, increasing the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER). Statistics show that this refrigerant has lower warranty service rates, and lower compressor failure rates.
We discuss HVAC accessory options
Sears offers optional accessories that make your home more comfortable:


An air filtration system added to your heating and air conditioning system can help minimize pollutants in your home, such as pollen, bacteria, dander, dust and more. An electronic air cleaner can filter out up to 95% of the particulates that pass through your HVAC system.


A furnace humidifier increases the humidity in your home during the dry winter months. The added humidity is good for your skin and respiratory system. It also helps keep wood inside the house from shrinking. And because humidified air feels warmer, you can turn down the thermostat to save energy.


A programmable thermostat lets you set up different temperatures for different times of day and days of the week. Once set, the thermostat automatically keeps the house at a comfortable temperature while you’re at home and active, and at an energy-saving temperature when you’re away or asleep.


We look at things that affect your HVAC system
To make sure your new HVAC system does the best job it can do, we go beyond just installing a new heating or cooling unit. We also check the condition of the ductwork and your home’s insulation, and make recommendations based on what we find.
*Installation includes standard labor to existing ductwork, electric/gas lines also removal of old equipment. Excludes: Permits, additional ductwork, electrical or codes upgrades and asbestos removal.

Frequently Asked Questions















WHAT SYMPTOMS IS GAS-X INDICATED FOR?
Gas-X relieves the pressure, abdominal bloating, and discomfort commonly referred to as gas.






HOW FAST WILL I FEEL BETTER?
Everyone’s biochemistry is a little different, so speed of gas relief will vary by person. But in general, Gas-X works in minutes. If you have prolonged discomfort though, it’s best to consult with your doctor, just in case.






WHAT CAUSES GAS AND BLOATING?
We have a whole page dedicated to this interesting topic, including some fun facts. Learn more about what causes gas here.






HOW DOES GAS-X RELIEVE GAS?
Gas-X works with your body to help relieve gas. Gas-X uses simethicone – the #1 doctor recommended OTC ingredient for fast gas relief – to break up gas bubbles in your stomach and intestines. Once this trapped gas is broken down, your body can then deal with the gas naturally.






WHAT ARE THE DIRECTIONS FOR USING GAS-X?
That depends on which Gas-X product you prefer to use. Click on this link to choose the product you’re interested in, then view that product’s Drug Fact PDF for usage instructions.






WHY DO I FEEL BLOATED WHEN I HAVE GAS?
Think of your stomach and intestines like a balloon. When they get filled up with more and more gas they expand, which makes you feel bloated.






CAN I TAKE GAS-X?
Yes. Simethicone, the active ingredient in Gas-X, works fast, without being absorbed into the bloodstream. Still, please use Gas-X products only as directed.






CAN GAS-X BE USED IF PREGNANT OR NURSING?
When pregnant or nursing, ask your doctor before taking any medication.






CAN ANTACIDS HELP RELIEVE GAS?
No. While some symptoms of gas can mimic heartburn - like discomfort after eating - antacids don’t relieve gas. They have a different active ingredient (example: calcium carbonate) that neutralizes the stomach acids coming into contact with your esophagus, rather than the buildup of gas in your digestive tract.

What Is Gas & Bloating?
If you suffer from gas and bloating (and their unfortunate symptoms), you're not alone.
What do 7 billion people have in common? They all suffer from gas, bloating, and their odious side effects. 1 (Yeah, we’re talkin’ flatulence.) No joke: these are very common problems, and they’re totally normal.





















What is gas?
Gas is a by-product of your body breaking down food for energy. But not all foods break down fully. Leftover carbohydrates stuck in your digestive tract can lead to gas. Gas can also be a result of eating too quickly, and swallowing too much air. It happens more than you think! And when you swallow a lot of air, you tend to feel bloated.1




































What is bloating?
Funny that you ask. Bloating is caused by the buildup of gas in your stomach, colon, or intestines. And these organs can stretch, so they’ll expand when they’re filled with too much air, causing you to feel overly full and uncomfortable. It’s not a fun scene.1





















There are two ways to pass gas and ease bloating:





















Burps are how you expel gas from your stomach.
It’s a natural reflex to air being swallowed while eating or drinking too quickly. The gas you burp out after a meal is mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide. Taking your time while eating, and avoiding straws while drinking, can reduce the amount of air you swallow, and in turn, your gas.2

The gas you burp out after a meal is mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide. Taking your time while eating, and avoiding straws while drinking, can reduce the amount of air you swallow, and in turn, your gas.2




































This is when the gas
 in your intestines
 is expelled through your rectum.
These gases are a little more complex: they’re a blend of nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, methane, and less than 1% hydrogen sulfide. But it’s that 1% that gives gas its complex pungency.

Frequently Asked Questions















WHAT SYMPTOMS IS GAS-X INDICATED FOR?
Gas-X relieves the pressure, abdominal bloating, and discomfort commonly referred to as gas.






HOW FAST WILL I FEEL BETTER?
Everyone’s biochemistry is a little different, so speed of gas relief will vary by person. But in general, Gas-X works in minutes. If you have prolonged discomfort though, it’s best to consult with your doctor, just in case.






WHAT CAUSES GAS AND BLOATING?
We have a whole page dedicated to this interesting topic, including some fun facts. Learn more about what causes gas here.






HOW DOES GAS-X RELIEVE GAS?
Gas-X works with your body to help relieve gas. Gas-X uses simethicone – the #1 doctor recommended OTC ingredient for fast gas relief – to break up gas bubbles in your stomach and intestines. Once this trapped gas is broken down, your body can then deal with the gas naturally.






WHAT ARE THE DIRECTIONS FOR USING GAS-X?
That depends on which Gas-X product you prefer to use. Click on this link to choose the product you’re interested in, then view that product’s Drug Fact PDF for usage instructions.






WHY DO I FEEL BLOATED WHEN I HAVE GAS?
Think of your stomach and intestines like a balloon. When they get filled up with more and more gas they expand, which makes you feel bloated.






CAN I TAKE GAS-X?
Yes. Simethicone, the active ingredient in Gas-X, works fast, without being absorbed into the bloodstream. Still, please use Gas-X products only as directed.






CAN GAS-X BE USED IF PREGNANT OR NURSING?
When pregnant or nursing, ask your doctor before taking any medication.






CAN ANTACIDS HELP RELIEVE GAS?
No. While some symptoms of gas can mimic heartburn - like discomfort after eating - antacids don’t relieve gas. They have a different active ingredient (example: calcium carbonate) that neutralizes the stomach acids coming into contact with your esophagus, rather than the buildup of gas in your digestive tract.

What Is Gas & Bloating?
If you suffer from gas and bloating (and their unfortunate symptoms), you're not alone.
What do 7 billion people have in common? They all suffer from gas, bloating, and their odious side effects. 1 (Yeah, we’re talkin’ flatulence.) No joke: these are very common problems, and they’re totally normal.





















What is gas?
Gas is a by-product of your body breaking down food for energy. But not all foods break down fully. Leftover carbohydrates stuck in your digestive tract can lead to gas. Gas can also be a result of eating too quickly, and swallowing too much air. It happens more than you think! And when you swallow a lot of air, you tend to feel bloated.1




































What is bloating?
Funny that you ask. Bloating is caused by the buildup of gas in your stomach, colon, or intestines. And these organs can stretch, so they’ll expand when they’re filled with too much air, causing you to feel overly full and uncomfortable. It’s not a fun scene.1





















There are two ways to pass gas and ease bloating:





















Burps are how you expel gas from your stomach.
It’s a natural reflex to air being swallowed while eating or drinking too quickly. The gas you burp out after a meal is mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide. Taking your time while eating, and avoiding straws while drinking, can reduce the amount of air you swallow, and in turn, your gas.2

This is when the gas
 in your intestines
 is expelled through your rectum.
These gases are a little more complex: they’re a blend of nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, methane, and less than 1% hydrogen sulfide. But it’s that 1% that gives gas its complex pungency.
