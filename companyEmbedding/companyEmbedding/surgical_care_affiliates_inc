Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (SCA), is one of the largest providers of Outpatient Surgery in the United States. Based in Deerfield, Illinois, the company has a network of more than 200 ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) located in 35 states performing 1 million procedures a year.[4]
SCA creates partnerships between health plans, physician groups, and health systems, to acquire, develop and optimize surgical facilities.[5] SCA's affiliated Physicians provide a range of surgical services, including orthopedics, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, pain management, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, or ENT), urology, spine, cardiology, and gynecology, as well as other general surgery procedures.[6]
SCA’s partners include large surgeon groups (e.g., OrthoCarolina, Illinois Bone and Joint, the CORE Institute, DISC, Jewett Orthopedics); large multi-speciality groups (e.g., Monarch Healthcare, DaVita Healthcare Partners, Austin Regional Clinic); and large health systems (e.g, Advocate Healthcare, Texas Health Resources, MemorialCare Health System).

On January 9, 2017, SCA and Optum (part of UnitedHealth Group) (NYSE: UNH) announced the two companies would combine.[8] The agreement calls for the acquisition of SCA’s outstanding common stock for $57.00 per share. In this agreement, SCA will become part of the OptumCare platform, with Hayek and the SCA leadership team continuing forward as part of SCA and the larger OptumCare platform. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2017.[9]

History[edit]
Origins
Surgical Care Affiliates was founded in 1982 by Joel Gordon in Nashville, Tennessee. Gordon had previously founded General Care Corp (NYSE: GCE) in 1969, a hospital company that was sold to Hospital Corporation of America (“HCA”) in 1980.[10]
Subsequent to selling General Care Corp to HCA, Gordon partnered with Andrew “Woody” Miller, an HCA executive,[11] and Jack Massey, a co-founder of HCA and American venture capitalist, to launch SCA.[12] SCA raised capital by listing shares on the New York Stock Exchange and used the proceeds to acquire existing surgery centers and build new surgery centers, mostly in the southeast.[13] From 1982 to 1995, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities, with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time.[14]

Early Growth
From 1982 to 1985, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time. HealthSouth acquired SCA in October 1995.[15] The acquisition made HealthSouth the largest provider of outpatient surgery in the nation with a total of 126 surgery centers.[16] HealthSouth acquired other surgery center companies, including ASC Network Corp and National Surgery Centers, and independent facilities during this period.[17] In March 2007, HealthSouth announced that it would sell its surgery center division to TPG Capital (TPG), a large private equity firm.[18]
SCA Today[edit]
In June 2007, TPG Capital acquired the assets of HealthSouth’s surgery division, effectively forming SCA as a new, stand-alone company.[19] The company was named Surgical Care Affiliates, in recognition of the original SCA.[20]
Current chairman and chief executive officer, Andrew Hayek, was hired in May 2008 as president and chief executive officer.[21] Hayek had previously been president of a division of DaVita Healthcare Partners and had been president and chief operating officer of Alliance Healthcare Services.[22]

SCA has grown significantly since 2009, including:[23]

Growing its portfolio to 205 facilities as of December 31, 2016
Achieving a 13% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EBITDA-NCI (“Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization less Non-Controlling Interests”, a common industry profit metric) growth from 2014 through 2016.[24]
Generating $2.1 billion in system wide revenue in 2016.


In 2016, SCA announced its inaugural Physician Advisory Board to provide feedback and direction on SCA's innovation and growth initiatives.
Partnerships[edit]
Texas Health Resources
In October 2012, SCA partnered with Texas Health Resources leadership to design and execute on a surgical strategy in the Dallas / Fort Worth market. Together with community surgeons, the partnership has grown from two facilities to 13 facilities.[25]
Monarch Healthcare
SCA is partnered with Monarch HealthCare, Orange County’s largest association of physicians in private practice.[26] In 2011, Monarch HealthCare was acquired by Optum, UnitedHealth’s health services division.[27] In February 2013, SCA entered into a joint venture partnership with MemorialCare Medical Foundation and Monarch HealthCare to optimize surgery in Southern California; the partnership now has 9 ASCs.[28]
Advocate Healthcare
In 2015, Advocate Health Care and SCA entered a joint venture to acquire and develop a surgery center network. Advocate Health Care was the largest fully integrated health care delivery system in the state of Illinois; the partnership currently has 11 ASCs, with more in development.[29]
SwiftPath
In May 2016, SCA made an investment in SwiftPath, LLC, which develops evidence-based, rapid recovery protocols that enable surgeons to perform hip and knee replacements in an outpatient setting.[30] The SwiftPath platform includes patient engagement and education, patient selection criteria, and peer-reviewed surgical techniques.[31] SCA currently has 43 outpatient facilities performing total joint replacements.[32]
Recognition[edit]
In 2015, SCA was named one of Becker’s ASC Review’s “Best Places to Work in Healthcare”http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/150-great-places-to-work-in-healthcare-2015/surgical-care-affiliates-15.html .
Medical Missions[edit]
SCA Medical Missions is a non-profit organization that supports week-long surgical medical mission trips to Honduras for US-based physicians, nurses, clinical and non-clinical personnel to provide free surgical care to people who cannot afford or access care. The program partnered with the Holy Family Surgery Center, an ambulatory surgery center located near Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on the grounds of a 2,000 acre orphanage (part of the Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos network) with more than 500 children.[33]

History[edit]
Origins
Surgical Care Affiliates was founded in 1982 by Joel Gordon in Nashville, Tennessee. Gordon had previously founded General Care Corp (NYSE: GCE) in 1969, a hospital company that was sold to Hospital Corporation of America (“HCA”) in 1980.[10]
Subsequent to selling General Care Corp to HCA, Gordon partnered with Andrew “Woody” Miller, an HCA executive,[11] and Jack Massey, a co-founder of HCA and American venture capitalist, to launch SCA.[12] SCA raised capital by listing shares on the New York Stock Exchange and used the proceeds to acquire existing surgery centers and build new surgery centers, mostly in the southeast.[13] From 1982 to 1995, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities, with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time.[14]

Early Growth
From 1982 to 1985, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time. HealthSouth acquired SCA in October 1995.[15] The acquisition made HealthSouth the largest provider of outpatient surgery in the nation with a total of 126 surgery centers.[16] HealthSouth acquired other surgery center companies, including ASC Network Corp and National Surgery Centers, and independent facilities during this period.[17] In March 2007, HealthSouth announced that it would sell its surgery center division to TPG Capital (TPG), a large private equity firm.[18]

Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (SCA), is one of the largest providers of Outpatient Surgery in the United States. Based in Deerfield, Illinois, the company has a network of more than 200 ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) located in 35 states performing 1 million procedures a year.[4]
SCA creates partnerships between health plans, physician groups, and health systems, to acquire, develop and optimize surgical facilities.[5] SCA's affiliated Physicians provide a range of surgical services, including orthopedics, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, pain management, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, or ENT), urology, spine, cardiology, and gynecology, as well as other general surgery procedures.[6]
SCA’s partners include large surgeon groups (e.g., OrthoCarolina, Illinois Bone and Joint, the CORE Institute, DISC, Jewett Orthopedics); large multi-speciality groups (e.g., Monarch Healthcare, DaVita Healthcare Partners, Austin Regional Clinic); and large health systems (e.g, Advocate Healthcare, Texas Health Resources, MemorialCare Health System).

On January 9, 2017, SCA and Optum (part of UnitedHealth Group) (NYSE: UNH) announced the two companies would combine.[8] The agreement calls for the acquisition of SCA’s outstanding common stock for $57.00 per share. In this agreement, SCA will become part of the OptumCare platform, with Hayek and the SCA leadership team continuing forward as part of SCA and the larger OptumCare platform. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2017.[9]

History[edit]
Origins
Surgical Care Affiliates was founded in 1982 by Joel Gordon in Nashville, Tennessee. Gordon had previously founded General Care Corp (NYSE: GCE) in 1969, a hospital company that was sold to Hospital Corporation of America (“HCA”) in 1980.[10]
Subsequent to selling General Care Corp to HCA, Gordon partnered with Andrew “Woody” Miller, an HCA executive,[11] and Jack Massey, a co-founder of HCA and American venture capitalist, to launch SCA.[12] SCA raised capital by listing shares on the New York Stock Exchange and used the proceeds to acquire existing surgery centers and build new surgery centers, mostly in the southeast.[13] From 1982 to 1995, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities, with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time.[14]

Early Growth
From 1982 to 1985, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time. HealthSouth acquired SCA in October 1995.[15] The acquisition made HealthSouth the largest provider of outpatient surgery in the nation with a total of 126 surgery centers.[16] HealthSouth acquired other surgery center companies, including ASC Network Corp and National Surgery Centers, and independent facilities during this period.[17] In March 2007, HealthSouth announced that it would sell its surgery center division to TPG Capital (TPG), a large private equity firm.[18]
SCA Today[edit]
In June 2007, TPG Capital acquired the assets of HealthSouth’s surgery division, effectively forming SCA as a new, stand-alone company.[19] The company was named Surgical Care Affiliates, in recognition of the original SCA.[20]
Current chairman and chief executive officer, Andrew Hayek, was hired in May 2008 as president and chief executive officer.[21] Hayek had previously been president of a division of DaVita Healthcare Partners and had been president and chief operating officer of Alliance Healthcare Services.[22]

SCA has grown significantly since 2009, including:[23]

Growing its portfolio to 205 facilities as of December 31, 2016
Achieving a 13% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EBITDA-NCI (“Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization less Non-Controlling Interests”, a common industry profit metric) growth from 2014 through 2016.[24]
Generating $2.1 billion in system wide revenue in 2016.


In 2016, SCA announced its inaugural Physician Advisory Board to provide feedback and direction on SCA's innovation and growth initiatives.
Partnerships[edit]
Texas Health Resources
In October 2012, SCA partnered with Texas Health Resources leadership to design and execute on a surgical strategy in the Dallas / Fort Worth market. Together with community surgeons, the partnership has grown from two facilities to 13 facilities.[25]
Monarch Healthcare
SCA is partnered with Monarch HealthCare, Orange County’s largest association of physicians in private practice.[26] In 2011, Monarch HealthCare was acquired by Optum, UnitedHealth’s health services division.[27] In February 2013, SCA entered into a joint venture partnership with MemorialCare Medical Foundation and Monarch HealthCare to optimize surgery in Southern California; the partnership now has 9 ASCs.[28]
Advocate Healthcare
In 2015, Advocate Health Care and SCA entered a joint venture to acquire and develop a surgery center network. Advocate Health Care was the largest fully integrated health care delivery system in the state of Illinois; the partnership currently has 11 ASCs, with more in development.[29]
SwiftPath
In May 2016, SCA made an investment in SwiftPath, LLC, which develops evidence-based, rapid recovery protocols that enable surgeons to perform hip and knee replacements in an outpatient setting.[30] The SwiftPath platform includes patient engagement and education, patient selection criteria, and peer-reviewed surgical techniques.[31] SCA currently has 43 outpatient facilities performing total joint replacements.[32]
Recognition[edit]
In 2015, SCA was named one of Becker’s ASC Review’s “Best Places to Work in Healthcare”http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/150-great-places-to-work-in-healthcare-2015/surgical-care-affiliates-15.html .
Medical Missions[edit]
SCA Medical Missions is a non-profit organization that supports week-long surgical medical mission trips to Honduras for US-based physicians, nurses, clinical and non-clinical personnel to provide free surgical care to people who cannot afford or access care. The program partnered with the Holy Family Surgery Center, an ambulatory surgery center located near Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on the grounds of a 2,000 acre orphanage (part of the Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos network) with more than 500 children.[33]

Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (SCA), is one of the largest providers of Outpatient Surgery in the United States. Based in Deerfield, Illinois, the company has a network of more than 200 ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) located in 35 states performing 1 million procedures a year.[4]
SCA creates partnerships between health plans, physician groups, and health systems, to acquire, develop and optimize surgical facilities.[5] SCA's affiliated Physicians provide a range of surgical services, including orthopedics, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, pain management, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, or ENT), urology, spine, cardiology, and gynecology, as well as other general surgery procedures.[6]
SCA’s partners include large surgeon groups (e.g., OrthoCarolina, Illinois Bone and Joint, the CORE Institute, DISC, Jewett Orthopedics); large multi-speciality groups (e.g., Monarch Healthcare, DaVita Healthcare Partners, Austin Regional Clinic); and large health systems (e.g, Advocate Healthcare, Texas Health Resources, MemorialCare Health System).
SCA is a publicly traded company and its shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "SCAI".[7]
On January 9, 2017, SCA and Optum (part of UnitedHealth Group) (NYSE: UNH) announced the two companies would combine.[8] The agreement calls for the acquisition of SCA’s outstanding common stock for $57.00 per share. In this agreement, SCA will become part of the OptumCare platform, with Hayek and the SCA leadership team continuing forward as part of SCA and the larger OptumCare platform. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2017.[9]

History[edit]
Origins
Surgical Care Affiliates was founded in 1982 by Joel Gordon in Nashville, Tennessee. Gordon had previously founded General Care Corp (NYSE: GCE) in 1969, a hospital company that was sold to Hospital Corporation of America (“HCA”) in 1980.[10]
Subsequent to selling General Care Corp to HCA, Gordon partnered with Andrew “Woody” Miller, an HCA executive,[11] and Jack Massey, a co-founder of HCA and American venture capitalist, to launch SCA.[12] SCA raised capital by listing shares on the New York Stock Exchange and used the proceeds to acquire existing surgery centers and build new surgery centers, mostly in the southeast.[13] From 1982 to 1995, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities, with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time.[14]

Early Growth
From 1982 to 1985, SCA grew to approximately 67 facilities with Ken Melkus serving as the CEO for most of that time. HealthSouth acquired SCA in October 1995.[15] The acquisition made HealthSouth the largest provider of outpatient surgery in the nation with a total of 126 surgery centers.[16] HealthSouth acquired other surgery center companies, including ASC Network Corp and National Surgery Centers, and independent facilities during this period.[17] In March 2007, HealthSouth announced that it would sell its surgery center division to TPG Capital (TPG), a large private equity firm.[18]
SCA Today[edit]
In June 2007, TPG Capital acquired the assets of HealthSouth’s surgery division, effectively forming SCA as a new, stand-alone company.[19] The company was named Surgical Care Affiliates, in recognition of the original SCA.[20]
Current chairman and chief executive officer, Andrew Hayek, was hired in May 2008 as president and chief executive officer.[21] Hayek had previously been president of a division of DaVita Healthcare Partners and had been president and chief operating officer of Alliance Healthcare Services.[22]

SCA has grown significantly since 2009, including:[23]

Growing its portfolio to 205 facilities as of December 31, 2016
Achieving a 13% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EBITDA-NCI (“Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization less Non-Controlling Interests”, a common industry profit metric) growth from 2014 through 2016.[24]
Generating $2.1 billion in system wide revenue in 2016.


In 2016, SCA announced its inaugural Physician Advisory Board to provide feedback and direction on SCA's innovation and growth initiatives.
Partnerships[edit]
Texas Health Resources
In October 2012, SCA partnered with Texas Health Resources leadership to design and execute on a surgical strategy in the Dallas / Fort Worth market. Together with community surgeons, the partnership has grown from two facilities to 13 facilities.[25]
Monarch Healthcare
SCA is partnered with Monarch HealthCare, Orange County’s largest association of physicians in private practice.[26] In 2011, Monarch HealthCare was acquired by Optum, UnitedHealth’s health services division.[27] In February 2013, SCA entered into a joint venture partnership with MemorialCare Medical Foundation and Monarch HealthCare to optimize surgery in Southern California; the partnership now has 9 ASCs.[28]
Advocate Healthcare
In 2015, Advocate Health Care and SCA entered a joint venture to acquire and develop a surgery center network. Advocate Health Care was the largest fully integrated health care delivery system in the state of Illinois; the partnership currently has 11 ASCs, with more in development.[29]
SwiftPath
In May 2016, SCA made an investment in SwiftPath, LLC, which develops evidence-based, rapid recovery protocols that enable surgeons to perform hip and knee replacements in an outpatient setting.[30] The SwiftPath platform includes patient engagement and education, patient selection criteria, and peer-reviewed surgical techniques.[31] SCA currently has 43 outpatient facilities performing total joint replacements.[32]
Recognition[edit]
In 2015, SCA was named one of Becker’s ASC Review’s “Best Places to Work in Healthcare”http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/150-great-places-to-work-in-healthcare-2015/surgical-care-affiliates-15.html .
Medical Missions[edit]
SCA Medical Missions is a non-profit organization that supports week-long surgical medical mission trips to Honduras for US-based physicians, nurses, clinical and non-clinical personnel to provide free surgical care to people who cannot afford or access care. The program partnered with the Holy Family Surgery Center, an ambulatory surgery center located near Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on the grounds of a 2,000 acre orphanage (part of the Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos network) with more than 500 children.[33]

Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA), OptumCare to Combine

Creates comprehensive ambulatory care services platform, including primary care, urgent care and surgical care services
Combination broadens ability of the companies to improve patient experience, and quality and cost of care
Companies to align strategy to support value-based payment models and a multi-payer approach
Builds on companies’ existing joint ventures, strong relationship and complementary capabilities

Wakefield, Mass., and Deerfield, Ill. (Jan. 9, 2017) — Optum, a leading health services company and part of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), and Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCAI), a leading ambulatory surgery center (ASC) and surgical hospital provider, are combining. The agreement calls for the acquisition of SCA’s outstanding common stock for $57.00 per share.
The combination of SCA with OptumCare, Optum’s primary and urgent care delivery services business working with more than 80 health plans, will position the combined organization as a comprehensive provider of ambulatory care services, while continuing expansion of SCA’s network of ASCs and surgical hospitals in partnership with leading health systems, medical groups and health payers. The combination builds upon the two companies’ successful ASC collaborations and expands OptumCare’s capabilities in outpatient surgical procedures.
“Joining with OptumCare will enable us to better support and empower independent physicians, helping them provide high-quality care for their patients while making health care more affordable.  The combination of SCA and OptumCare is another step forward toward our vision of becoming the partner of choice for surgeons,” said Andrew Hayek, chairman and chief executive officer of SCA. “We already have a strong relationship with OptumCare, so we have seen firsthand that our cultures and strategies are aligned and complementary.”
Larry C. Renfro, vice chairman of UnitedHealth Group and Optum chief executive officer, said: “Combining SCA and OptumCare will enable us to continue the transition to high-quality, high-value ambulatory surgical care, partnering with the full range of health systems, medical groups and health plans.  We have an incredibly high regard for SCA’s leadership and people, so we look forward to working with them and our payer partners to implement care models that reward independent surgeons and specialists for quality and care efficiency.”
System-wide, SCA and its affiliates serve approximately 1 million patients per year in more than 30 states.  The company is a leader in partnering strategically with many health plans, medical groups and health systems to align with physicians through value-based payment models that reward quality, patient experience and cost-efficiency.
With the combination, SCA will become part of the OptumCare platform, which serves millions of consumers annually through 20,000 affiliated physicians and hundreds of care facilities. Hayek and the SCA leadership team will continue forward as part of SCA and the larger OptumCare platform. The companies will offer compelling quality and value to patients and payers and support independent doctors’ practices as eligible surgical cases (e.g., total joint replacements) continue to migrate to the ASC and surgical hospital environments.
The agreement calls for the acquisition of SCA’s outstanding common stock for a fixed price of $57.00 per share, to be funded between 51 percent and 80 percent with UnitedHealth Group common stock, with the final percentage to be determined at UnitedHealth Group’s option and the remainder in cash. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2017, subject to the tender of a majority of SCA’s shares, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to be neutral to UnitedHealth Group’s outlook for adjusted net earnings per share in 2017 and modestly accretive in 2018.
“Over the past eight years, we have had the great pleasure of partnering with SCA as the business has transformed into a leader in the health care services sector,” said Lead Independent Director of SCA and Managing Partner of TPG Capital Todd B. Sisitsky. “We believe this combination will create significant value for SCA's patients and physician partners, and we look forward to the combined company’s future success.” Affiliates of TPG Capital, owning approximately 30 percent of the common stock of SCA, have agreed to tender their shares as part of the offer.

      Statements


      This communication may contain statements that constitute 
      “forward-looking statements,” including, for example, information 
      related to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (“UnitedHealth Group”), 
      Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc. (“SCA”) and the proposed acquisition of 
      SCA by UnitedHealth Group. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” 
      “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and 
      similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally 
      are not historical in nature. Such statements reflect the current 
      analysis of existing information and involve substantial risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      those expressed or implied by such statements. The following factors, 
      among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
      described in these forward-looking statements: the possibility that 
      various conditions to the consummation of the UnitedHealth Group 
      exchange offer and mergers may not be satisfied or waived, including the 
      receipt of regulatory clearances related to the mergers; uncertainty as 
      to how many shares of SCA common stock will be tendered into the 
      UnitedHealth Group exchange offer; the risk that the UnitedHealth Group 
      exchange offer and mergers will not close within the anticipated time 
      periods, or at all; the failure to complete or receive the anticipated 
      benefits from UnitedHealth Group’s acquisition of SCA; the possibility 
      that the parties may be unable to successfully integrate SCA’s 
      operations into those of UnitedHealth Group; such integration may be 
      more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; revenues 
      following the transaction may be lower than expected; operating costs, 
      customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, 
      difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, 
      clients, suppliers or physicians) may be greater than expected following 
      the transaction; the retention of certain key employees at SCA may not 
      be achieved; the parties may be unable to meet expectations regarding 
      the timing, completion and accounting and tax treatments of the 
      transactions; UnitedHealth Group and SCA are subject to intense 
      competition; factors that affect UnitedHealth Group’s ability to 
      generate sufficient funds to maintain its quarterly dividend payment 
      cycle; the effects of local and national economic, credit and capital 
      market conditions; and the other risks and uncertainties relating to 
      UnitedHealth Group and SCA described in their respective Annual Reports 
      on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and in their 
      subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form
