History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]

Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]

Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co Ltd[edit]
A software development unit that has created, among others, Tencent Traveler and later versions of QQ IM,[128] as well as some mobile software.[129] This subsidiary is located at the Southern District of Hi-Tech Park, Shenzhen.[128] It also holds a number of patents related to instant messaging and massively multiplayer online game gaming.[130]
Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]
2011-2014: Early investments[edit]
On February 18, 2011, Tencent acquired a majority equity interest (92.78%)[53] in Riot Games, developer of League of Legends, for about USD 230 million.

On the 16th December 2015, Riot Games sold its remaining equity to Tencent Holdings.[54][55] Tencent acquired a minority stake in Epic Games, developer of franchises like Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, in June 2012.[56] Tencent in 2013 increased its stake in Kingsoft Network Technology, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation, to 18%.

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]
Game development[edit]
Starting in 2016, Tencent developed a video gaming console dubbed TGP (Tencent Gaming Platform) Box. The TGP BOX is called the Blade. It is an Intel- powered console running Windows 10 and a TGP Box mode. So far, the TGP console has imported many Tencent games, such as League of Legends, FIFA Online 3, NBA 2K, Monster Hunter, Need for Speed, etc. Tencent hoped to bring third-party developed games.[citation needed]
Branching out from messaging products, Tencent's first game was QQ Tang (QQ堂) in 2004. This was soon followed QQ YinSu (QQ音速) in 2006 and QQ SanGuo(QQ三国) in 2007.[citation needed] In 2011, Tencent started hosting the game League of Legends. Tencent's mobile game Honor of Kings was the most downloaded app in the world on the IOS App Store in the first quarter of 2017.[84]
Virtual goods[edit]
Tencent sells virtual goods[85] for use in their MMOs,[86] its IM client, social networking sites,[87] and for mobile phones.[88] Income from the sale of virtual goods was a large proportion of Tencent's revenue in 2009.[25]
Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]
Locations[edit]
Tencent's headquarters are located in the Southern Hi-Tech Park District (Chinese: 新科技园 xīnkējìyuán) in Nanshan District, Shenzhen.[92][93] Other sites include a 48,000 square meter compound that houses an R&D center in the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone,[94] a data and R&D center in Tianjin's Binhai Service Outsourcing Industry Park that is expected to be finished by June 2013,[95] and also some 17,646 square meters of Shanghai office space purchased through a subsidiary, Tencent Cyber (Tianjin), and located in the Shanghai Modern Technology Services Community Zone.[96]

It is the most popular social mobile application in China and some overseas Chinese communities, for instance, Malaysia.

A software development unit that has created, among others, Tencent Traveler and later versions of QQ IM,[128] as well as some mobile software.[129] This subsidiary is located at the Southern District of Hi-Tech Park, Shenzhen.[128] It also holds a number of patents related to instant messaging and massively multiplayer online game gaming.[130]
Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]
2011-2014: Early investments[edit]
On February 18, 2011, Tencent acquired a majority equity interest (92.78%)[53] in Riot Games, developer of League of Legends, for about USD 230 million.

On the 16th December 2015, Riot Games sold its remaining equity to Tencent Holdings.[54][55] Tencent acquired a minority stake in Epic Games, developer of franchises like Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, in June 2012.[56] Tencent in 2013 increased its stake in Kingsoft Network Technology, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation, to 18%.

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]
Game development[edit]
Starting in 2016, Tencent developed a video gaming console dubbed TGP (Tencent Gaming Platform) Box. The TGP BOX is called the Blade. It is an Intel- powered console running Windows 10 and a TGP Box mode. So far, the TGP console has imported many Tencent games, such as League of Legends, FIFA Online 3, NBA 2K, Monster Hunter, Need for Speed, etc. Tencent hoped to bring third-party developed games.[citation needed]
Branching out from messaging products, Tencent's first game was QQ Tang (QQ堂) in 2004. This was soon followed QQ YinSu (QQ音速) in 2006 and QQ SanGuo(QQ三国) in 2007.[citation needed] In 2011, Tencent started hosting the game League of Legends. Tencent's mobile game Honor of Kings was the most downloaded app in the world on the IOS App Store in the first quarter of 2017.[84]
Virtual goods[edit]
Tencent sells virtual goods[85] for use in their MMOs,[86] its IM client, social networking sites,[87] and for mobile phones.[88] Income from the sale of virtual goods was a large proportion of Tencent's revenue in 2009.[25]
Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]
Locations[edit]
Tencent's headquarters are located in the Southern Hi-Tech Park District (Chinese: 新科技园 xīnkējìyuán) in Nanshan District, Shenzhen.[92][93] Other sites include a 48,000 square meter compound that houses an R&D center in the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone,[94] a data and R&D center in Tianjin's Binhai Service Outsourcing Industry Park that is expected to be finished by June 2013,[95] and also some 17,646 square meters of Shanghai office space purchased through a subsidiary, Tencent Cyber (Tianjin), and located in the Shanghai Modern Technology Services Community Zone.[96]

Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]
2011-2014: Early investments[edit]
On February 18, 2011, Tencent acquired a majority equity interest (92.78%)[53] in Riot Games, developer of League of Legends, for about USD 230 million.

On the 16th December 2015, Riot Games sold its remaining equity to Tencent Holdings.[54][55] Tencent acquired a minority stake in Epic Games, developer of franchises like Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, in June 2012.[56] Tencent in 2013 increased its stake in Kingsoft Network Technology, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation, to 18%.

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]
Game development[edit]
Starting in 2016, Tencent developed a video gaming console dubbed TGP (Tencent Gaming Platform) Box. The TGP BOX is called the Blade.

Virtual goods[edit]
Tencent sells virtual goods[85] for use in their MMOs,[86] its IM client, social networking sites,[87] and for mobile phones.[88] Income from the sale of virtual goods was a large proportion of Tencent's revenue in 2009.[25]
Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]
Locations[edit]
Tencent's headquarters are located in the Southern Hi-Tech Park District (Chinese: 新科技园 xīnkējìyuán) in Nanshan District, Shenzhen.[92][93] Other sites include a 48,000 square meter compound that houses an R&D center in the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone,[94] a data and R&D center in Tianjin's Binhai Service Outsourcing Industry Park that is expected to be finished by June 2013,[95] and also some 17,646 square meters of Shanghai office space purchased through a subsidiary, Tencent Cyber (Tianjin), and located in the Shanghai Modern Technology Services Community Zone.[96]

Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]
2011-2014: Early investments[edit]
On February 18, 2011, Tencent acquired a majority equity interest (92.78%)[53] in Riot Games, developer of League of Legends, for about USD 230 million.

On the 16th December 2015, Riot Games sold its remaining equity to Tencent Holdings.[54][55] Tencent acquired a minority stake in Epic Games, developer of franchises like Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, in June 2012.[56] Tencent in 2013 increased its stake in Kingsoft Network Technology, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation, to 18%.

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]
Game development[edit]
Starting in 2016, Tencent developed a video gaming console dubbed TGP (Tencent Gaming Platform) Box. The TGP BOX is called the Blade.

Virtual goods[edit]
Tencent sells virtual goods[85] for use in their MMOs,[86] its IM client, social networking sites,[87] and for mobile phones.[88] Income from the sale of virtual goods was a large proportion of Tencent's revenue in 2009.[25]
Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]
Locations[edit]

Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]
2011-2014: Early investments[edit]
On February 18, 2011, Tencent acquired a majority equity interest (92.78%)[53] in Riot Games, developer of League of Legends, for about USD 230 million.

On the 16th December 2015, Riot Games sold its remaining equity to Tencent Holdings.[54][55] Tencent acquired a minority stake in Epic Games, developer of franchises like Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, in June 2012.[56] Tencent in 2013 increased its stake in Kingsoft Network Technology, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation, to 18%.

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]
Game development[edit]
Starting in 2016, Tencent developed a video gaming console dubbed TGP (Tencent Gaming Platform) Box. The TGP BOX is called the Blade.

Virtual goods[edit]
Tencent sells virtual goods[85] for use in their MMOs,[86] its IM client, social networking sites,[87] and for mobile phones.[88] Income from the sale of virtual goods was a large proportion of Tencent's revenue in 2009.[25]
Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]
Locations[edit]

Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

Even though currently Tencent is relatively fair valued, the healthy ecosystem Tencent has built over years would pave a steady path for further growth. Company Background and Industry Overview Tencent Holdings Limited (SEHK 0700), a leading provider of Internet value added services in China, is the biggest gaming company (by revenue) in the world. Its main products and services cover social network, web portal, media, e-commerce, mobile games and online games. In 2016, with a 48% increase in total revenue ($21.903 billion), Tencent became the 10th largest publicly traded company in the world. Furthermore, Tencent holds a significant amount of stake in other giant companies: 15% stake of JD.com ((NASDAQ:JD), one of largest B2C online retailers in China), 5% stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and 12% in Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), the third-largest gaming company in the world. Tencent's major competitor is Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Alibaba is focusing on B2B and B2C services through its Taobao and Alipay. Alibaba tried to transform its Alipay into a personal finance platform. However, without social networking functions support, people are reluctant to switch from Tencent's WeChat payment to Alipay. Until today, Alipay is mainly functioning as a third party transaction payment portal, instead of an all-in-one APP like WeChat. On the other hand, as a search engine provider, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is collecting traffic data, trying to present a new picture of intelligent search for users and developers through big data, cloud computing, deep learning and other core technologies. Technically speaking, Baidu will not have any direct competition with Tencent on many core businesses such as gaming and social network APP. Further, in the short term, no other new entrants would have the technology innovation or financial scale to challenge Tencent. Hence, it is safe to conclude that Tencent would hold its competitive advantage for a quite long time period.
 Investment Thesis I am going long Tencent for three reasons: the healthy ecosystem created by its social network app, the robustly growing gaming division and other diversified but lucrative products and services. The healthy ecosystem created by its social network APP Tencent's own social network app QQ instant messager and WeChat have created unparalleled competitive advantages for Tencent. Unlike Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that has been confined to a communication platform geared towards advertisers, Tencent's WeChat platform evolves into a combination of a news publisher, a social network app and a portal used for online-to-offline commerce transactions. There are 889 million Monthly Active Users (MAU) on WeChat right now; over 300 million of users make payments such as hospital bills and transportation fees through WeChat, which explained a lot why payment-related revenue increased by 275% to $543 million in 2016. Currently, there are over 200,000 businesses accepting WeChat offline payment in-store, and the number is still growing at an exponential rate. According to a PwC research, more than 70% of WeChat users tend to spend more than 100 RMB per month on WeChat, 61% of WeChat users open WeChat more than 10 times per day, and 61.3% of users check Moments each time they open WeChat. All these healthy numbers indicate a greater future growth for Tencent. Robustly Growing Gaming Division Tencent is dominant in Chinese gaming industry, accounting for half of the industrial revenue. Tencent's gaming empire is mainly composed of two parts: PC gaming and mobile gaming. In PC games, Tencent owns three most popular games -League of Legends, Dungeon and Fighter, and Crossfire. The multi-player online battle PC game, League of Legends (LOL) alone, has consistently been the world's top-grossing PC game since 2014. LOL has generated more than $1 billion in 2014, $1.63 billion in 2015 and $1.9 billion in 2016. Given the popularity of PC game and increasing professional eSport game worldwide, the strong momentum is more than likely to continue. The other two games have a similar trend. With little doubt to say, Tencent could continually monetize its advantages while further strengthening its research and development ability to deliver new popular PC games.
 By acquiring Supercell (the producer of "Clash of Clan"), Tencent is also making a major bet on the future of mobile gaming industry. On IOS system portal, along with several games in the pipeline, Tencent has six of the top ten highest grossing games in China. According to IDC's research, China mobile games generated $7.3 billion of revenue in 2016. The market is projected to reach $11.1 billion of revenue by 2019. With current 39% market penetration rate and 5% market growth rate, it is reasonable to assume that Tencent could at least maintain its current position in mobile gaming, which is around $6.28 billion. Therefore, with such solid driving-force, Tencent's mobile gaming division should also have foreseeable decent revenue in the near future. Other Diversified but Lucrative Products and Services Tencent is marching into the entertainment industry as well. Two of its significant products/services are QQ music and Tencent Video. QQ music is one of leading online music platforms providing legitimated music to Chinese users. It has more than 400 million of active users, doubled from last year, accounting for 15% of Chinese online music market. To further integrate QQ music with Chinese digital music industry, Tencent has formed an exclusive strategic partnership with many music publishers, which only allows QQ/WeChat users to have access to certain music. The other lucrative product/service is Tencent Video, an online video streaming website fully owned by Tencent. In November 2016, it had over 20 million of subscribers, which more than tripled year-to-year basis. Inspired by the great success of Netflix original show, Tencent has invested a variety of resources into developing its original TV series; many of those original shows are played over 100 million times online. Coupled with huge viewer traffic and media exposure, Tencent all-around diversified product/service would definitely boost Tencent's future revenue. IV. Conclusion: China's three biggest IT companies (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) have diverged their development path towards different directions. Tencent, with its unparalleled huge user base, healthy ecosystem and cutting-edge R&D team, would firmly march to its next milestone. No short-term direct competition enables Tencent to allocate more capital and resource on long-term return, the recent investment in start-up companies is a great example of Tencent's vision and goal.
 It is not unfathomable that Tencent could soon arm itself with one of America's big-name services. The Chinese giant might acquire Activision Blizzard or Snap (NYSE:SNAP) as the stepping stone to full engagement in the North America market. With its best talent, loyal user base and abundant cash on hand, maybe only sky is the limit for Tencent.

Tencent Now China’s Top Company in Private Economy Triumph

                Rare case of private company overtaking state-owned enterprise
            



                China’s largest company rises on mobile gaming, ad growth
            













Tencent Becomes China's Top Company




Tencent Holdings Ltd. has surpassed China Mobile Ltd. to become the country’s most valuable corporation, underscoring the growing importance of a vibrant private economy over lumbering state-owned enterprise.Tencent rose 4.2 percent to HK$210.20 in Hong Kong on Monday, reaching a market value of HK$1.99 trillion ($256.6 billion), edging past China Mobile’s HK$1.97 trillion and putting the tech company in the ranks of the world’s 10 largest public companies, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Tencent’s shares have jumped four-fold in as many years by building a lead in mobile gaming and online advertising, surpassing a roughly 20 percent advance in the Hang Seng Index. The company’s rise exemplifies the new realities of the world’s second largest economy, where smokestack industries prepare to lay off workers while younger companies such as e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. make inroads into everything from finance to media. Private businesses, marginalized for decades by a state sector that enjoyed easy funding from government-owned banks, now play a pivotal role in hiring and innovation, and the best performers are spearheading China’s shift toward a consumption-led economy.




“China’s economic restructuring is happening faster than many have expected,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist for Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. Services accounted for more than half of output last year for the first time, while consumption made up more than 70 percent of the expansion in the first half of this year. The rise of companies such as Tencent shows China can unlock still more of its growth potential by giving more market access to private companies and rolling back state monopolies, he said.A view of Tencent's future headquarters in Shenzhen.

Since 2006, the title of China’s most valuable company has been held mainly by government-controlled industrial heavyweights such as China Mobile, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. or PetroChina Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tencent arch-foe Alibaba also briefly held the title just after its 2014 debut.Chinese internet sector stocks have been buoyed by the strategic importance the country now places on the sector. State-backed funds and enterprises are championing some of the biggest private investment rounds in companies such as Ant Financial and Didi Chuxing. President Xi Jinping, recognizing the sector’s importance to both political and economic control, has designated its top entrepreneurs key targets for party outreach.

It wasn’t always like this. For years, China’s private companies operated in the long shadow of the gargantuan state sector, deprived of capital and support. Early entrepreneurs founded nationwide brands from Wahaha mineral water to Haier appliances, paving the way for today’s captains of industry like Alibaba’s Jack Ma and Tencent’s own Ma Huateng. Hungry to expand, they sought out overseas money: Alibaba gained investment from SoftBank Group Corp. and Yahoo! Inc.; Tencent won the backing of Naspers Ltd., a South African media company; Baidu Inc.’s early investors included IDG Capital Partners, according to Crunchbase.




Along with Alibaba, Tencent has now advanced to the vanguard of the private sector. Its strategy of driving revenue growth via advertising and gaming through messaging applications WeChat and QQ have brought more than 1 billion users into the fold. The company has beaten revenue and earnings estimates in all but one of the past six quarters.The company has designs to build a Disney-like entertainment empire. It’s splurging on content from anime to Hollywood movies to generate ad sales, which rose 60 percent in the June quarter. Popular titles including Cross Fire and Naruto Mobile helped Tencent more than double smartphone gaming revenue to 9.6 billion yuan in the period.“When it comes to intellectual property, you have to serve the chicken many ways,” Tencent’s Ma, China’s third-richest man, said of his aspirations during a rare press conference earlier this year. “It should be viewed as cross-platform entertainment and be developed from multiple dimensions.”(A previous version of this story was corrected to show market value in trillions, not billions)— With assistance by Miao Han

Tencent Holdings Limited (Chinese: 腾讯控股有限公司; pinyin: Téngxùn Kònggǔ Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī; literally: "Soaring information"; SEHK: 700) is a Chinese investment holding company whose subsidiaries provide media, entertainment, payment systems, internet and mobile phone value-added services and operate online advertising services in China.[22] Its headquarters are in Nanshan District, Shenzhen.
Tencent is one of the largest Internet companies, as well as the largest gaming company in the world.[23] Its many services include social network, web portals, e-commerce, mobile games and multiplayer online games.[24] Offerings in China include the well-known instant messenger Tencent QQ and one of the largest web portals, QQ.com.[25] Mobile chat service WeChat has helped bolster Tencent's continued expansion into smartphone services.
Tencent has been credited as one of the world's most innovative companies by numerous media and firms such as Boston Consulting Group, rising rapidly in its Innovative Rankings.[26][27][28]
In April 13, 2015, the market value of Tencent exceeded US$200 billion for the first time, hitting US$206 billion.[29] On September 8, 2015, Tencent became the largest Internet company in Asia by value after Alibaba Group Holding Limited suffered a major drop ($141 billion over 10 months) in its share value.[30]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]
Game development[edit]
Starting in 2016, Tencent developed a video gaming console dubbed TGP (Tencent Gaming Platform) Box. The TGP BOX is called the Blade.

Virtual goods[edit]
Tencent sells virtual goods[85] for use in their MMOs,[86] its IM client, social networking sites,[87] and for mobile phones.[88] Income from the sale of virtual goods was a large proportion of Tencent's revenue in 2009.[25]
Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]
Locations[edit]
Tencent's headquarters are located in the Southern Hi-Tech Park District (Chinese: 新科技园 xīnkējìyuán) in Nanshan District, Shenzhen.[92][93] Other sites include a 48,000 square meter compound that houses an R&D center in the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone,[94] a data and R&D center in Tianjin's Binhai Service Outsourcing Industry Park that is expected to be finished by June 2013,[95] and also some 17,646 square meters of Shanghai office space purchased through a subsidiary, Tencent Cyber (Tianjin), and located in the Shanghai Modern Technology Services Community Zone.[96]

Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]

Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]

Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

History[edit]
1998-2010: Founding, growth[edit]
Tencent was founded by Ma Huateng, Zhang Zhidong, Xu Chenye, Chen Yidan and Zeng Liqing in November 1998[43] as Tencent Inc.[44] Incorporated in the Cayman Islands,[45] initial funding was provided to it by venture capitalists.[22] In February 1999, Tencent's iconic messenger product OICQ released.[46] Shortly after, Tencent had its name changed to QQ; this was said to be due to a lawsuit threat from ICQ and its owner AOL.[43][47] The company remained unprofitable for the first three years.[43] South African media company Naspers purchased a 46% share of Tencent in 2001. (As of 2014, it owns 34%.[48]) Tencent Holding Ltd was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 16 June 2004,[44] and it was added as a Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock in 2008.[49] The company originally derived income solely from advertising and premium users of QQ, who pay monthly fees to receive added extras.[43] But by 2005, charging for use of QQ mobile, its cellular value-added service, and licensing its iconic penguin character, which could be found on snack food[50] and clothing,[43] had also become income generators.[43] By 2008, Tencent was seeing profit growth from the sale of virtual goods.[51] While Tencent's services have included online gaming since 2004, around 2007–2008 it rapidly increased its offerings by licensing games.[52] While least two, CrossFire and Dungeon Fighter Online, were originally produced by South Korean game developers, Tencent now makes its own games.[52]
2011-2014: Early investments[edit]
On February 18, 2011, Tencent acquired a majority equity interest (92.78%)[53] in Riot Games, developer of League of Legends, for about USD 230 million.

On the 16th December 2015, Riot Games sold its remaining equity to Tencent Holdings.[54][55] Tencent acquired a minority stake in Epic Games, developer of franchises like Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, in June 2012.[56] Tencent in 2013 increased its stake in Kingsoft Network Technology, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation, to 18%.

In June 2017, Tencent began discussions to acquire Angry Birds creators Rovio Entertainment.[39][40]
Game development[edit]
Starting in 2016, Tencent developed a video gaming console dubbed TGP (Tencent Gaming Platform) Box. The TGP BOX is called the Blade. It is an Intel- powered console running Windows 10 and a TGP Box mode. So far, the TGP console has imported many Tencent games, such as League of Legends, FIFA Online 3, NBA 2K, Monster Hunter, Need for Speed, etc. Tencent hoped to bring third-party developed games.[citation needed]
Branching out from messaging products, Tencent's first game was QQ Tang (QQ堂) in 2004. This was soon followed QQ YinSu (QQ音速) in 2006 and QQ SanGuo(QQ三国) in 2007.[citation needed] In 2011, Tencent started hosting the game League of Legends. Tencent's mobile game Honor of Kings was the most downloaded app in the world on the IOS App Store in the first quarter of 2017.[84]
Virtual goods[edit]
Tencent sells virtual goods[85] for use in their MMOs,[86] its IM client, social networking sites,[87] and for mobile phones.[88] Income from the sale of virtual goods was a large proportion of Tencent's revenue in 2009.[25]
Tencent's online currency, Q Coins, can be used to purchase virtual goods.[89] These range from the offbeat, such as virtual pets[90] and the virtual clothing, jewelry, and cosmetics needed to customize online-game avatars,[91] to the more mundane, such as more storage space, wallpapers, bigger photo albums,[87] and ring tones.[88]
Locations[edit]
Tencent's headquarters are located in the Southern Hi-Tech Park District (Chinese: 新科技园 xīnkējìyuán) in Nanshan District, Shenzhen.[92][93] Other sites include a 48,000 square meter compound that houses an R&D center in the Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone,[94] a data and R&D center in Tianjin's Binhai Service Outsourcing Industry Park that is expected to be finished by June 2013,[95] and also some 17,646 square meters of Shanghai office space purchased through a subsidiary, Tencent Cyber (Tianjin), and located in the Shanghai Modern Technology Services Community Zone.[96]

A software development unit that has created, among others, Tencent Traveler and later versions of QQ IM,[128] as well as some mobile software.[129] This subsidiary is located at the Southern District of Hi-Tech Park, Shenzhen.[128] It also holds a number of patents related to instant messaging and massively multiplayer online game gaming.[130]
Controversy[edit]
Copying claims[edit]
Many of Tencent's software and services are remarkably similar to those of competitors. The founder and chairman, Huateng "Pony Ma" Ma, famously said, "[To] copy is not evil." A former CEO and President of SINA.com, Wang Zhidong, said, "Pony Ma is a notorious king of copying." Jack Ma of Alibaba Group stated, "the problem in Tencent is no innovation; all things are copies."[131]
As of 2009, the company held 400 patents.[132]
Anti-malware software cheating allegations[edit]
In 2015, security testing firms AV-Comparatives, AV-TEST and Virus Bulletin jointly decided to remove Tencent from their software whitelists. The Tencent products supplied for testing were found to contain optimizations that made the software appear less exploitable when benchmarked but actually provided greater scope for delivering exploits.[133] Additionally, software settings were detrimental to end-users protection if used. Qihoo was later also accused of cheating, while Tencent was accused of actively gaming the anti-malware tests.[134][135]
Critics on King of Glory[edit]
People's Daily publishes article King of Glory: entertaining the public or framing the life and King of Glory: enhancing the restriction and monitoring on social games is in emergency on 3 and 4 July 2017 respectively. This causes Tencent's stake price falls 5% on the day.[136]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
