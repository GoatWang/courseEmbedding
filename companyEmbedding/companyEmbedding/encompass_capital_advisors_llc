Background Information:


Encompass Capital Advisors LLC »
Encompass Capital Advisors' (ECA) investment advisory services generally focus on investments, both long and short, in the equity and equity-linked securities of US companies and abroad. They invest in energy and energy-related markets with emphasis on the oil & gas, coal, and alternative energy sectors, including natural gas, crude and refined oil products, steel and other metals, chemicals, power, coal and alternative energy. Their funds may also invest in derivatives, commodities, including futures, debt securities, including convertible debt securities, and other investments. In addition, the funds may invest a portion of their assets in illiquid investments, such as real estate-related assets (including leases and royalties), PIPEs, container freight derivatives and private equity investments.ECA primarily focuses on fundamental long/short equity strategies. The firm uses both fundamental top-down and bottom-up analysis to develop a deep, fundamental view of individual companies and sectors. They attempt to identify relative values within a sector by selecting the under- and out-performers, and will take long and short positions to express these views. To identify under- and out-performers, ECA relies on fundamental, quantitative and/or statistical analysis. The firm employs risk management and other systems to provide quantitative insights that allow proactive management of the portfolio across all aspects of the investment process.
