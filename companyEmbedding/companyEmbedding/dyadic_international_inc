                        Dyadic Story
                    


Dyadic International, Inc. (OTC Pink: DYAI) is a global biotechnology company located in Jupiter, Florida with its main research and development operations located in The Netherlands.
Dyadic is focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of enzymes and other proteins for the bioenergy, biochemical, industrial enzyme and biopharmaceutical industries.
State-of-the-art platform
Dyadic utilizes an integrated technology platform based on its patented and proprietary C1 fungus which enables the development and large scale manufacture of low cost enzymes and other proteins for diverse market opportunities. The C1 platform technology can also be used to screen for the discovery of novel genes and proteins.
Dyadic’s technologies overcome the inadequacy of existing gene discovery and product development techniques which have limited capabilities to efficiently access the full spectrum of earth’s biodiversity. Dyadic’s unique technology increases the likelihood that each time a useful gene is discovered, it can also be expressed and then mass-produced.
Dyadic actively pursues licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities to leverage the value of these technologies by providing its partners and collaborators with the benefits of manufacturing and/or utilizing the enzymes which these technologies help produce.
Serving diverse industries
Dyadic currently sells more than 55 liquid and dry enzyme products to more than 150 industrial customers in approximately 50 countries for a broad range of industries including biofuels, bio-based chemicals, biopharmaceuticals, animal health and nutrition, pulp & paper, textiles, food and beverage, and nutraceuticals.





                        Mission and Strategy
                    


Mission
Dyadic uses its proprietary C1 platform technology to discover and develop novel genes and other biological products from eukaryotic organisms found in the full spectrum of the earth’s biodiversity. Once useful genes are isolated, Dyadic uses its integrated platform to manufacture specific proteins, doing so more rapidly and efficiently — and with a much higher rate of success than existing gene discovery systems.
Strategy
Dyadic leverages its proprietary technology platform to discover novel genes and biological products for use by its strategic partners, and to further its own R&D efforts.
Dyadic seeks strategic alliances with major leaders in the agricultural, bioenergy, industrial enzyme, chemical and biopharmaceutical industries that have in-house genomic capabilities. Dyadic will also collaborate with companies whose genomic capabilities are limited, discovering and expressing biological materials for these strategic partners.
In addition, Dyadic, using these proprietary systems, will continue to commercialize enzymes for use in targeted markets, including the animal nutrition, detergent, ethanol, pulp and paper, biopharmaceutical, starch and textile industries.
Dyadic expects to generate revenue from its product sales, revenue generated from research and development services and funding as well as revenue generated from licensing and other strategic collaborations in the form of milestone and royalty payments.

Services
Dyadic scientists have developed the patented fungal microorganism Chrysosporium lucknowense – or C1 – to rapidly discover and express genes, and to manufacture those novel gene products using C1 as the host organism from beginning to end. By utilizing a single organism for all steps of the process, Dyadic’s integrated platform eliminates many of the bottlenecks inherent in other technologies currently used to bring gene products to market.
 
C1 is superior to other gene discovery systems because its integrated technology significantly increases the probability of success. Once a useful gene is detected, it is expressed and then has a high likelihood of being overexpressed to result in a commercially viable product, reducing costs and greatly saving time and resources. By comparison, existing expression systems often require the use of a new host organism for product development and/or production purposes once a desired gene has been discovered and isolated.

Gene Discovery
The Fungal HTRS System from Dyadic, enables rapid gene discovery from all biodiversity (including eukaryotes) using the C1 host organism.
Host Optimization
The C1 platform allows for optimization of the host production organism and manufacturing process.
Proteins expressed using the C1 Expression System provide the foundation for proper glycosylation.
Large Scale Manufacturing
The C1 organism has been used for biomolecule production in 150,000 liter fermenters since 1996.

    Strain and Fermentation Process Development (More at Strain & Process Development)
    Biological Products Manufacturing (More at Manufacturing Services)
 
High Throughput Robotic Screening
Dyadic’s groundbreaking gene discovery platform – the C1 Fungal High-Throughput Robotic Screening (HTRS) system – is the only technology that utilizes high-throughput robotic screening with a non-yeast eukaryotic host, Chrysosporium lucknowense or C1. As a result of this breakthrough, Dyadic has innovated the only gene discovery platform by which eukaryotic genes – the genes of complex living organisms – can be discovered via functional expression utilizing existing high throughput robotic screening equipment.
Bacteria – which are often used in the ultra high-throughput screening of prokaryotes and other simple life forms – are unable to express eukaryotic genes efficiently, due to their inability to splice introns or eliminate the sugar residue in gene products.
C1, however, is a eukaryotic organism, with the innate ability to process the introns found in fungi, plants, animals and humans, thus converting genomic DNA into functional proteins. Unlike other gene expression platforms which are typically limited by their use of prokaryotes, Dyadic’s integrated C1 technology enables researchers to access DNA from the entire gene pool, providing access to the earth’s entire spectrum of biodiversity.
 
By some estimates, eukaryotes account for over 90% of the species on the planet. By using C1, this untapped resource can be mined for useful genes and gene products, for use by the biopharmaceutical, diagnostic, health and beauty aids, agriculture, food and beverage, chemicals and fibers, animal health and feed, and pulp and paper industries.
 
The C1 strain developed by Dyadic researchers has a distinct morphology compared to other filamentous fungi found in the wild, which can be extremely viscous and highly matted organisms. However, evolution in the laboratory led to a strain of C1 with a distinctly non-filamentous morphology (see images below). This results in growth properties characterized by low viscosity and a lack of matting, allowing C1 to be cultivated in the low volume cultures necessary to conduct high-throughput robotic screening.
Dyadic is also developing functional biomolecule libraries for use by other companies – under suitable business arrangements – to screen for products of commercial value. When desired by a business partner, Dyadic will also screen microorganisms and other natural sources for novel eukaryotic genes and proteins of commercial value.
 
Gene Overexpression & Optimization
Dyadic has developed and continues to develop innovative tools for gene expression via its proprietary fungal host, Chrysosporium lucknowense, or C1. This host organism is Dyadic’s premier system for the overexpression of genes and the production of proteins that until now have been difficult to express and produce in other systems.
 
Dyadic’s C1 overcomes the limitations of other host systems – such as bacteria and yeast – commonly used by industry for expressing genes from natural sources.  Unlike bacteria and yeast, C1 efficiently splices introns, and its glycosylation - or sugar structures - are similar to those observed in mammals.
 
Dyadic’s integrated C1 technology is primed for optimization of the host production organism as well as the manufacturing process. This creates a number of proven, differentiating advantages over current gene expression systems, including:
 
- Extremely efficient protein production and secretion Protein yields from C1 are unprecedented in the industry.
 
- A variety of both inducible and constitutive promoters Dyadic’s integrated gene expression system provides a variety of genetic switches to choose from, thus increasing the likelihood of successful expression.
 
- Varying host genetic backgrounds Host strains with varying genetic backgrounds are currently in development, to ensure successful gene expression for each project’s objective. Whether the goal is to produce large amounts of protein inexpensively, or to produce a single protein in pure form, C1 has a host system that will be well suited for either target.
 
- Favorable growth conditions  C1 can grow and express proteins over a wide range of pH and temperature, allowing for gene expression under conditions optimal for the activity and stability of a wide range of targets. A particular advantage of C1 over other fungal expression systems is its ability to produce proteins at neutral pH, allowing for the production of proteins of physiological and biopharmaceutical interest.
Dyadic continues to develop and refine its gene expression technologies, achieving milestones and technology breakthroughs. Among the recent milestones is the high-level expression of a human gene for a biopharmaceutical product candidate; and the demonstration of a core glycosylation structure that is more “human-like” than those of yeasts and other fungi.
Dyadic believes that the unique properties of C1 will make it the premier system for the expression of genes essential to numerous industries.
 
Strain Improvement and Process Development
Dyadic’s research teams have the proven ability to bring biological products to market in minimal time. This is largely due to the pairing of strain and fermentation development processes, so that information from one naturally leads to improvements in the other. When combined with the use of hyper-producing C1 strains possessing excellent promoters, expression cassettes, and transformation techniques, these processes contribute to economically viable levels of protein production achieved in a short time.
 
The success of this approach is evident in Dyadic’s first major research program – the discovery and development of neutral cellulases in Chrysosporium lucknowense, or C1. Within one year, the wild strain of fungus discovered in the soil of eastern Russia was brought to commercial reality by Dyadic researchers. This achievement was followed by another significant advance when the same researchers tripled C1’s enzyme levels the next year.
 
It is this integrated approach to discovery and innovation that gives Dyadic the edge to develop groundbreaking new products from the earth’s vast gene pool, bringing nature to the marketplace.
 
Manufacturing Services
 
Fermentation processes utilize microorganisms to produce commercial products for such diverse industries, as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food ingredients, industrial and specialty enzymes, diagnostics and bioinsecticides and pesticides. Dyadic has broad experience and extensive know-how to optimize and scale up fermentation processes, ranging from biological process development and optimization to commercial scale production.
 
Dyadic’s vast expertise – paired with its manufacturing capabilities and readily available capacities from small to very large (up to 150,000 liter) fermenters- offer competitive costs while providing access to a continual supply of the biological products, both today and in the future.
 
Our services are fully integrated from the development of new or existing bioprocesses at the lab-scale to pilot-scale, to large-scale commercial production of economically viable bio-products. Utilizing these services from Dyadic allows others to use valuable resources to focus on core competencies – product discovery, development, marketing and distribution, not on large capital expenditures.
 
Dyadic’s groundbreaking technology also enables the company to provide integrated genomics solutions from gene discovery to manufacturing process. C1 is the only integrated system equipped to go from robotic gene discovery to commercial manufacturing within the same organism, thereby significantly increasing the chance of commercializing newly discovered gene products while dramatically shortening the time to commercialization.
