Investment Successes
We Have a History of Strong ROI's
We're proud of our previous investments and believe that they deserve to be highlighted to better showcase the extent and nature of our investment behavior. Here are some selected success stories:




 





 





 







 





 



Gemcor
Scenario
Founded in 1937 by Thomas Speller Sr., Gemcor invented the automated fastening process to support aircraft production during World War II. Gemcor’s Drivmatic® process quickly became an industry standard for automated aircraft assembly.
However, in the early 2000s, given global terrorism and resulting industry cyclicality as well as limited historical investment in its business, Gemcor’s financial position significantly eroded.  The management team sought partners to revitalize and recapitalize the business, to reposition it on solid footing. Chronology
In June 2004, Rand partnered with another investor, along with the local Erie County Industrial Development Agency and the senior management team, to recapitalize Gemcor.  Rand invested $625,000 for a 31% equity stake and provided $250,000 of debt capital.  In 2009, Rand provided a $500,000 subordinated promissory note and in 2012, Rand provided an additional $1 million subordinated promissory note.
Along the way, Rand worked with the senior management team to reorganize the company, change its business practices and invest in needed equipment to improve efficiency.
Armed with a stronger business model and favorable industry outlook, the company successfully emerged.  Over time, Gemcor has applied its proprietary electric drivmatic riveting process to produce highly engineered, high precision, cutting edge machines. Since Gemcor’s inception over 75 years ago, over 2200 Gemcor systems have been shipped worldwide as the company continues to be the favored, more reliable solution leading the aerospace industry in automated fastening. Outcome
Revenue increased by more than 5x over 12 years while in Rand’s portfolio, to approximately $35 million.  During that period, the workforce grew from 29 to 95.
In March 2016, Gemcor was sold to Ascent Aerospace, a leading integrator of aircraft assembly line solutions.  Rand realized total proceeds of approximately $15 million, representing a return on its invested capital of approximately 11x and an internal rate of return of approximately 64%.
BinOptics
Scenario
BinOptics was founded in the technology incubator of Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York.  The company sought capital to support its development and marketing of specialty semiconductor lasers.  BinOptics evolved to be a leading merchant
    provider of indium phosphide lasers for data centers, mobile backhaul, silicon photonics and access networks.    Chronology
In November 2011, Rand made its initial investment of approximately $700,000 in BinOptics Series 2 convertible preferred shares, immediately followed by an additional equity investment of approximately $490,000 in December 2011 for more of the same class
    of shares.  To support further growth, in December 2012, Rand participated in a follow-on capital raise and provided approximately $609,000 for additional shares from the same class, resulting in a total investment of approximately $1.8 million
    which equated to a 4% ownership interest.
The BinOptics product offering quickly and successfully penetrated the marketplace. Outcome
In December 2014, M/A-COM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., a leading supplier of high-performance RF, microwave, millimeterwave and phototonic products acquired BinOptics.  Rand realized total proceeds of approximately $10.1 million, representing
    a return on its invested capital of approximately 5.5x and an internal rate of return of over 75%.
Liazon
Scenario
Liazon was founded in 2007 by healthcare and insurance veterans, who realized that the technological revolution that had fundamentally altered our lives in so many ways could change how we choose, and use, health insurance and other employee benefits,
    for the better.  They formed Bright Choices ® which gathers products from leading national carriers and provides an online store where consumers can shop from among diverse benefit arrays. Chronology
Rand initially invested $500,000 by providing subordinated debt with warrants as a bridge loan in November 2010.  As a participant in the company’s next equity financing, which included full repayment of the bridge loan, Rand reinvested $820,000
    in April 2011, participating with three other investment partners.  To support the company’s growth, Rand once again participated in a further equity capital raise, providing $275,000 in April 2012.  Rand’s equity investment
    was approximately $1.1 million for a 3% position.
To make the employee benefits selection process simple and effective, the Liazon team built in technology and education so that people can make informed decisions relative to their benefits choices and needs.  The results have launched an industry
    revolution. Outcome
Revenue increased by more than 2.5x over three years while in Rand’s portfolio, to approximately $6 million.  During that period, the workforce grew from 27 to 101.
In December 2013, Liazon was acquired by Towers Watson, now Willis Towers Watson, a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth, Rand realized total proceeds of approximately
    $6.6 million, representing a return on its invested capital of approximately 4x and an internal rate of return of approximately 97%.
Synacor
Scenario
Founded in 1998, Synacor was formed to enable cable, satellite, telecom and consumer electronics companies to deliver TV Everywhere, digital entertainment, services and apps to their end-consumers, strengthening those relatioships while monetizing the
    engagement.  Chronology
Rand’s initial investment was in November 2002, providing  $350,000 of subordinated debt with warrants to recapitalize the company.  It was followed by a $400,000 equity investment in October 2004 and an additional $158,000 equity investment
    in October 2006 (net of debt repayment).  In November 2007, Rand exercised its warrants, with an additional investment of $350,000.  Rand’s total equity investment was approximately $908,000 for a 4% position.
The company has evolved to become a trusted technology development, multiplatform services and revenue partner. Outcome
Revenue increased by more than 60x over 13 years while in Rand’s portfolio, to approximately $110 million.  During that period, the workforce grew from 25 to 315.
In February 2012, Synacor shares began trading on the Nasdaq by executing an Initial Public Offering (IPO).  Rand sold some of its shares into the IPO and opportunistically sold its remaining shares over time, completing its exit in June 2015. 
    Rand realized approximately $4.1 million of proceeds upon the sale of its equity stake, realizing a return on its invested capital of approximately 3x and an internal rate of return of approximately 16%.
Innov-X Systems, Inc.
Scenario
In 2001, Don Sackett founded Innov-X Systems, Inc., located in Woburn, Massachusetts, with several of his former co-workers by raising $800,000 in start-up capital from family, friends and angel investors. Mr. Sackett had a vision for manufacturing a specialty line of handheld XRF (X-Ray Fluorescent) alloy metals analyzers, around a Compaq, pocket-PC platform. The founding management team believed they had a winning strategy, which utilized off the shelf components and a safer technology (their competitor's units were primarily based on radioactive isotopes) while utilizing proprietary software algorithms, which allowed the units to be more easily calibrated, used and upgradeable in the future.
Though the founding management team originally planned to sell online x-ray equipment for manufacturing applications, they soon learned that the consumer "marketplace" demands for the product were for handheld-type units. Innov-X began selling its first hand-held units in 2002. However, the early demand for the product caused a need for growth capital for the business.
In 2003, the company began to seek out this capital to fund the growth. A Buffalo, New York-based consultant was working with the entrepreneur for some time and an introduction to Rand was made. Rand visited the company and attended an industry trade show to learn more about this emerging market sector.
Over the next six to nine months, Rand SBIC helped to identify another institutional investor to partner with Rand SBIC for the investment opportunity and was able to negotiate an investment term sheet that was acceptable to both Innov-X and the investors group. Chronology
In 2004 and 2005, Rand SBIC funded a total of $600,000 of investment capital into Innov-X, in the form of a five-year term subordinated debenture, with warrants for an equity position in the company. Rand SBIC's co-investor provided the same amount of funding. Rand was also appointed to the Innov-X Board of Directors.
The company continued to experience growth in demand for its products, and in doing so, experienced issues faced by many high growth companies, including production capacity, staffing, marketing, quality, identifying new markets for products, expanding internationally and the need for additional senior management. The Board of Directors, including the investors, helped the management team with many of these issues, though it was the entrepreneurial drive of the CEO/Founder that was the driving force for the success of the company through these many challenges. Mr. Sackett continued to lead the company to record sales and profitability levels. In addition, during this time, Innov-X kept close communication and a working relationship with Key Bank, who provided constant financial support to the growing business.
In 2006, new international regulations regarding testing of noxious metals in electronics resulted in unprecedented sales and demand for Innov-X's novel handheld instruments. This growth attracted the interest of a large Boston-based investment fund, Summit Partners. Outcome
In December 2006, a minority position of the company was sold to Summit in the form of Preferred Equity, for a total investment of $27 million. Rand SBIC's debentures were repaid and thus realized a gain of $2.2 million from a partial sale of its equity holdings. As part of the Summit financing, Rand re-invested over $1 million back into the company, as a participant in the new financing.
In total, Rand made an equity investment of $1.7 million through three investments, acquiring an equity ownership of approximately 9%.
Innov-X experienced record revenue and grew from 17 employees to approximately 150 over less than eight years while in Rand’s portfolio.  In August 2010, Rand sold its investment in Innov-X, realizing total proceeds of nearly $5.4 million, representing a return on its invested capital of approximately 4.3x and an internal rate of return of approximately 82%.

BUFFALO, NY -- (Marketwired) -- 07/20/17 -- Rand Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: RAND) ("Rand"), a venture capital company which invests in growth businesses with unique product, service or technology concepts, announced that it recently invested $3 million, partnering with Advantage Capital and Coastal Enterprises in a $6.6 million capital raise and refinancing package for GENICON, Inc. As part of the capital transaction, $2 million of previously outstanding promissory notes payable to Rand were converted into a new term loan, and Rand infused an additional $1 million. GENICON is recognized as an emerging leader in the design, production and distribution of patented surgical instrumentation focused exclusively on laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery. This capital transaction increases Rand's total investment in GENICON to $4 million, consisting of $1 million of Series B Preferred Shares acquired in 2015 and the new $3 million term loan. GENICON now represents the largest investment in the Rand portfolio.Gary W. Haberland, Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of GENICON, commented, "We have been diligently developing new products to serve the growing needs of our global marketplace. This includes two recently introduced products: 1) the aquas powerflow is a battery powered suction irrigation product which we believe will revolutionize surgical irrigation, and 2) the a li-gator disposable clip applier ergonomically facilitates wound closure using titanium clips. We appreciate the support of our investors who have provided us capital to fund tooling for such new product lines as well as expand our production capacity, vertically integrating certain product lines to further enhance our quality and reduce our costs."Daniel P. Penberthy, Rand's Executive Vice President, added, "GENICON is one of the rising stars within our portfolio. With its innovative approach to providing healthcare surgical solutions, the company continues to grow at a double digit pace. With each step in GENICON's growth curve, Rand was pleased to support the business with the needed capital to continue to develop new products and execute on its marketing, manufacturing and sales efforts. Rand has now made six investments in GENICON which have assisted the company in developing a full suite of unique and highly differentiated medical device products that are currently distributed to the surgical community that spans more than 44 countries around the world. We appreciate the opportunity to invest alongside Advantage Capital and Coastal Enterprises as GENICON grows and matures."ABOUT GENICONFounded in 1998 and based in Orlando, FL, GENICON is recognized as an emerging leader in the design, production, and distribution of patented surgical instrumentation focused exclusively on laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery.

	About








About
Providing Venture Capital for Over 45 YearsRand Capital is a Business Development Company (BDC) that focuses its equity investments in early or expansion stage companies or can structure its debenture investments for mature companies.  Rand looks for strong leadership who is bringing to market new or unique products, technologies or services that have a high potential for growth.
BDCs are publically traded closed-end funds that enable investors to participate in high yielding private market investing while maintaining daily liquidity.  What makes us stand out from other BDCs is that our primary focus is to achieve long-term capital appreciation on equity investments, while maintaining current cash flow from debt and dividend-paying equity.
We typically partner with other investors and lead transactions in the vicinity of our home geography of Upstate New York.  We frequently participate on the Boards of Directors of companies within our investment portfolio or otherwise advise their management teams. To understand Rand is to understand our strategy for investing and to understand our underlying portfolio companies.What Makes Us UniqueWhat makes us stand out from other companies is that we are essentially a fund with investments in small, private companies with a unique product or service.  We are different from most other BDCs, given our heavy weighting on equity appreciation.Our ResultsOur Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) was established in 2002.  Since then, until December, 31 2016, we exited 27 investments and achieved a 3.0x cash multiple on our investments in those companies, achieving a 25.0% internal rate of return. 
In the past five years ending December 31, 2016, we exited 12 investments and achieved a 4.0x cash multiple on our investments in those companies, achieving a 32.3% internal rate of return.
Having skin in the game (~15% insider ownership), coupled with years of venture capital experience is a powerful combination.
