Geoff Bybng






  
            I am only commenting on the Buddhist section.  Mr O'Donell does very slightly better than most Christian authors in dealing with Buddhism.  He also makes the usual mistakes.  He states that Buddhism could almost accept an impersonal God, and that Dharma can mean Life Force.  These are nonsenses.  The word dharma can mean either 'Way' or 'Truth', or - a completely separate meaning 'phenonemon'. The concept of impersonal God is the same word as for soul 'Atman'.  The Buddhist doctrine is Anatman, which clearly means no soul and no God, and the Buddha says this many times in the texts.  In fact, an omnipotent God is just as impossible in a Buddhist universe as in a scientific one.  The doctrine of emptiness does not mean underlying truth: it means that there is no underlying truth, and it very clearly says so.My only other gripe with this quite good book is that it is not a general book.  It is, specifically, a Christian take on world religions, as the text frequently makes clear.  It is being marketed under false pretensions.

Publisher's Description▼▲
A trusted pastor and author shows how the Old Testament books pave the way for Christ.


Publisher Description▼▲
At the end of Luke's gospel two disciples, as they walked toward the village of Emmaus, met a man who explained to them how the whole of the Old Testament spoke of Jesus. When he left them they asked one another, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked?" In Their Hearts Burned, author Kevin O'Donnell explains how each of the Old Testament books looks forward to Jesus.


Kevin O'Donnell is an Anglican minister and prolific author who was a religious education teacher both before and after theological training at St. Stephen's House, Oxford. Before returning to parish ministry in 1999, he was chaplain at Heathfield School, Ascot.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.



From our Membership Agreement
"Lulu is a place where people of all ages, backgrounds, experience, and professions can publish, sell, or buy creative content such as novels, memoirs, poetry, cookbooks, technical manuals, articles, photography books, children's books, calendars, and a host of other content that defies easy categorization. We help people distribute information and art spanning a wide range of subject matter while providing a safe, friendly, respectful, and serious site for all content creators. Since our community serves a broad range of ages, we do not encourage content that could make a majority of our users uncomfortable."
If you are sure that this product is in violation of acceptable content as defined in the agreement or that it does not meet our guidelines for General Access, please fill out the form below. It will then be reviewed by Lulu Staff to determine the next course of action.

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

Your notification has been sent
Lulu Staff has been notified of a possible violation of the terms of our Membership Agreement. Our agents will determine if the content reported is inappropriate or not based on the guidelines provided and will then take action where needed.
