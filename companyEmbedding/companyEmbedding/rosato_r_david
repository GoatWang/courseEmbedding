Item Description: Springer-Verlag New York Inc., United States, 2012. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. This third edition has been written to thoroughly update the coverage of injection molding in the World of Plastics. There have been changes, including extensive additions, to over 50 of the content of the second edition. Many examples are provided of processing different plastics and relating the results to critiCal factors, which range from product design to meeting performance requirements to reducing costs to zero-defect targets. Changes have not been made that concern what is basic to injection molding. However, more basic information has been added concerning present and future developments, resulting in the book being more useful for a long time to come. Detailed explanations and interpretation of individual subjects (more than 1500) are provided, using a total of 914 figures and 209 tables. Throughout the book there is extensive information on problems and solutions as well as extensive cross- referencing on its many different subjects. This book represents the ENCYCLOPEDIA on IM, as is evident from its extensive and detailed text that follows from its lengthy Table of CONTENTS and INDEX with over 5200 entries.The worldwide industry encompasses many hundreds of useful plastic-related computer programs. This book lists these programs (ranging from operational training to product design to molding to marketing) and explains them briefly, but no program or series of programs can provide the details obtained and the extent of information contained in this single sourcebook. Softcover reprint of the original 3rd ed. 2000.  Bookseller Inventory # LIE9781461370772

This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. In this 3rd Edition of the Reinforced Plastics Handbook the authors have continued the approach of the late John Murphy, author of the first and second editions.The book provides a compendium of information on every aspect of materials, processes, designs and construction.Fiber-reinforced plastics are a class of materials in which the basic properties of plastics are given mechanical reinforcement by the addition of fibrous materials. The wide choice of plastics resin matrices and the correspondingly wide choice of reinforcing materials mean that the permutations are virtually unlimited. But the optimum properties of resin and reinforcement cannot be obtained unless there is an effective bond between the two, and this is the continuing objective of reinforced plastics production, design and processing.
