We were a disposable society. But as we learned the implications on our earth and future generations, the move to "go green" grew. The government helped mandate the movement with guidelines and regulations. But with the explosion in technology, our electronics became obsolete at an alarming rate, and no one quite knew what to do with them.  At Maven, we'll recycle your electronics responsibily, helping you meet both governmental regulations and your own personal sense of doing the right thing -- with the assurance that your data and privacy are completely protected in the process.   What to Recycle Computers Laptops Monitors Televisions Networking Devices CD/DVD/VHS/Blue-Ray Players MP3 Players iPods Stereos Cell Phones PDAs Answering Machines Power Supplies Microwaves Wire & Cabling View a complete list on our Recycling Answers page.    Why Recycle Sustaining Our Environment The viability of our communities rely heavily on individual choices. Recycling is the responsible response to the exponential growth of technology; improper disposal of obsolete and end-of-life equipment threatens our water, earth, and air. By reducing the amount of equipment that is discarded into landfills, we can reduce the amount of hazardous toxins that seep into our water tables and soil. Proper recycling also limits the practice of burning waste, a practice that releases hazardous toxins into the air we breathe. Improving the Quality of Our Lives By working with Maven to recycle your investments, you will be saving money, protecting the world we live in, and promoting a safe, healthy lifestyle – factors which will immediately contribute to a better quality of life and the viability of our communities.

Right after delivery she began coughing up blood, at first the doctors suspected pneumonia, as it turns out it was not pneumonia at all but stage 3 of a rare cancer of the placenta called choriocarcinoma; which filled her lungs with tumors.  The baby girls are doing well; Jenna is being slowly brought out of a medically induced coma, while undergoing chemo as well as undergoing a treatment for her lungs called ECMO.  This treatment is a pump that circulates the blood through an artificial lung and without this treatment her condition would be 100% fatal.

 

Jenna’s husband is U.S. Army Sgt. Brandon Hinman, and while his military insurance covers all medical costs, there are still the daily, weekly and monthly costs associated with travel and food.  The Hinman's are looking at a long road towards recovery and all funds raised will go to offset these incalculable costs for the Hinman family.

 Cash donations will gratefully be accepted for the Hinman family .41Electronics Recycling success in Albany!1A recap of our recycling event in Albany (April 2011)全部帖子Maven Technologies 分享了帖子 · 2月28日 · Maven Technologies · 2月28日 · Maven Technologies is hiring  Please submit resumes and salary requirements to dsullivan@maventech.com, along with the position for which you are applying.
