Thirteen years later the EU amended the TPD to incorporate vaping products, regardless of their lack of tobacco content. The vaping industry had been put on notice.May 20, 2016 was chosen as the deadline for each of the EU member states to enact the new rules of the TPD directive into national law, with the discretion to exceed those minimum requirements. In 2016 and 2017 most, though not all EU countries, have implemented national TPD-related legislation.  Now here we are in 2017 and TPD compliance is a reality for Nicopure Labs.With a sizeable business in the EU, especially in France, the UK, and the Netherlands, we at Nicopure consider it both our duty and our mission to support and service retailers, distributors, and vape consumers throughout Europe. Compliance with the TPD provides Nicopure with the opportunity to connect with our overseas business partners and consumers to build a stronger relationship of trust.To that end, we have sent compliance certification statements to all our valued business partners in the EU, assuring them thatthe Nicopure Labs LLC products are compliant with TPD specifications (notably bottle size and labeling), andthe products we currently manufacture and export to the European Union were notified through the online EU notification portal before the November 20, 2016 deadline and are therefore compliant.Meeting the requirements of the revised TPD was not a simple task. It took many months and the efforts of multiple teams worldwide to achieve. But Nicopure is proud to say we’ve registered in the following EU member states (product offerings and nicotine strengths may vary by country), successfully navigating the applicable individual, often complex compliance requirements of these countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.At the end of the day, TPD compliance is beneficial for both consumers and vape product manufacturers, especially major ones like our company. Indeed, we’re touting many of the benefits that will result from its implementation.It’s hard to argue with the TPD’s requirement to disclose e-liquid ingredients to the various member states. Hard, that is, unless you have something in your e-liquids that you’d rather not be known. Providing ingredients information instills greater consumer confidence that you’re offering a good quality product.For Nicopure, quality ingredients are what distinguishes our products from other manufacturers. TPD enables us to validate for the European market what we’ve said about our products since day one.Another TPD requirement is that each product must include a leaflet with instructions on how to use it safely and correctly. Again, it’s hard to argue with what seems like a common-sense guideline that keeps consumers informed.EU countries also require manufacturers to include health warnings that generally cover 30 percent of each product’s packaging. Though this requirement has some disputable elements, health warnings certainly provide valuable information. As Nicopure sees it, they are an important means of communicating with consumers.While TPD could be viewed as restrictive and requiring a significant amount of investment from vape manufacturers, it is far less onerous than the Deeming Rule the FDA has implemented in our own country, the United States of America. We remain eager to work with the various governments and regulatory bodies of the EU to make TPD’s implementation as smooth and beneficial to our customers as possible.Click here to view our TPD-Compliance Resource Center.
