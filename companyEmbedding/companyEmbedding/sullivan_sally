Sally Sullivan





































I have been sewing snowballs and stuffed animals for about a year. I give them to The Women’s & Children’s Hospital, Baptist Children’s Home, & Providence Hospital. I’m retired and I own an embroidery machine, so when I can’t sleep I love to sew. I, really don’t count the toys I make, I have gone through about three of the 10 pound boxes of Poly-fil Brand fiberfill so far.
