NRG Energy confirms South Central Generating LLC debt acceleration








11/21/2002









































MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Nov. 21, 2002 -- NRG South Central Generating LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc., Thursday received a notice of acceleration from the bond trustee, on behalf of bondholders, for its 8.962 percent senior secured series A-1 bonds due 2016 and its 9.479 percent senior secured series B-1 bonds due 2024.The notice of acceleration renders the approximately $750 million in debt, which is nonrecourse to NRG Energy, immediately due and payable.Based on discussions with the bondholders, it is NRG's understanding that the bond trustee issued the acceleration notice to preserve certain rights, and NRG continues negotiations with bondholders."We will continue to work with our lenders toward an overall restructuring of NRG's debt," said Richard C. Kelly, NRG president and chief operating officer. "We do not believe that the NRG South Central Generating bondholders' action will negatively affect the course of those discussions."NRG South Central Generating defaulted on the bonds when it did not make approximately $47 million in combined principal and interest payments, due September 15, on the two bond issuances and did not make the required payments before the 15-day grace period expired.NRG Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, develops and operates power-generating facilities. Its operations include competitive energy production and cogeneration facilities, thermal energy production and energy resource recovery facilities.[Native Advertisement]Xcel Energy is a major U.S. electricity and natural gas company with regulated operations in 12 Western and Midwestern states. The company provides a comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services to 3.2 million electricity customers and 1.7 million natural gas customers through its regulated operating companies. In terms of customers, it is the fourth-largest combination natural gas and electricity company in the United States. Company headquarters are located in Minneapolis.Source: NRG Energy, Inc.

NRG SOUTH CENTRAL GENERATING LLC - 10-K - 20030414 - BUSINESS














	Item 1 







	Business









	General



	     

	NRG South Central Generating LLC (NRG South
	Central), is a Delaware limited liability company formed in
	2000. NRG South Central owns approximately 2,500 MW of net
	electric generating capacity as of December 31, 2002
	through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Louisiana Generating LLC
	(Louisiana Generating), NRG New Roads Holdings LLC, NRG
	Sterlington Power LLC (NRG Sterlington), Big Cajun I
	Peaking Power LLC (Big Cajun 1 Peaking), NRG Bayou Cove LLC
	and NRG Bayou Peaking Power LLC (together, NRG Bayou Cove). NRG
	South Centrals headquarters and principal executive
	offices are located at 901 Marquette Avenue, Suite 2300,
	Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402. NRG South Centrals phone
	number is (612) 373-5300.


	     

	NRG South Central is an indirect wholly-owned
	subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG Energy). NRG Energy is an
	energy company, primarily engaged in the ownership and operation
	of power generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity
	and related products in the United States and internationally.
	NRG Energy is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc.
	(Xcel Energy). Xcel Energy directly owns six utility
	subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in
	12 states. Xcel Energy also owns or has interest in a
	number of non-regulated businesses, the largest of which is NRG
	Energy.


	     

	Due to a number of reasons, including the overall
	down-turn in the energy industry, NRG Energys financial
	condition has deteriorated significantly. As a direct
	consequence, in 2002 NRG Energy entered into discussions with
	its creditors in anticipation of a comprehensive restructuring.
	NRG Energy is working toward this goal by selective divestiture
	of non-core assets, consolidation of management, reorganization
	and redirection of power marketing philosophy and activities and
	an overall financial restructuring that will improve liquidity
	and reduce debt. In connection with its restructuring efforts,
	it is likely that NRG Energy (and certain of its subsidiaries)
	will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. If NRG
	Energy seeks protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
	Code, it is likely that NRG Energy would also seek such
	protection for certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, which may
	include NRG South Central. For more information about NRG
	Energys restructuring process, refer to the Form 10-K
	filed by NRG Energy on March 31, 2003.


	     

	As a part of the comprehensive restructuring, NRG
	Energys financial and legal restructuring advisors have
	been assisting the management of NRG South Central in the
	preparation of a comprehensive financial and operational
	restructuring for NRG South Central. NRG South Central and its
	advisors have been meeting regularly to discuss restructuring
	issues relating to NRG South Central with an ad hoc committee of
	its bondholders (the NRG South Central Bondholder Committee).
	NRG South Central, its management and its financial and legal
	advisors have engaged in discussions with the NRG Project
	Bondholder Committee regarding the terms and conditions of a
	restructuring of the debt of NRG South Central.


	     

	NRG South Central, NRG Energy and Xcel Energy
	file periodic reports and other documents with the Securities
	and Exchange Commission. The public may read and copy the
	materials filed with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference
	Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. The
	public may also obtain information on the operation of the
	Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In
	addition, electronic copies of these periodic filings are
	available through the Commissions web site at www.sec.gov.




	Liquidity Issues



	 















	Liquidity Issues of NRG Energy and it
	Subsidiaries  Current Status and Chain of
	Events







	     

	In December 2001, Moodys Investor Service
	(Moodys) placed NRG Energys long-term senior
	unsecured debt rating on review for possible downgrade. In
	response, Xcel Energy and NRG Energy put into effect a plan to
	preserve NRG Energys investment grade rating and improve
	its financial condition. This plan

	Table of Contents





	included financial support to NRG Energy from
	Xcel Energy; marketing certain NRG Energy assets for sale;
	canceling and deferring capital spending; and reducing corporate
	expenses.



	     

	In response to a possible downgrade, during 2002,
	Xcel Energy contributed $500 million to NRG Energy, and NRG
	Energy and its subsidiaries sold assets and businesses that
	provided NRG Energy in excess of $286 million in cash and
	eliminated approximately $432.0 million in debt. NRG Energy
	also cancelled or deferred construction of approximately
	3,900 MW of new generation projects. On July 26, 2002,
	Standard & Poors (S&P) downgraded NRG
	Energys senior unsecured bonds to below investment grade,
	and three days later Moodys also downgraded NRG
	Energys senior unsecured debt rating to below investment
	grade. Since July 2002, NRG Energy senior unsecured debt, as
	well as the secured NRG Northeast Generating LLC bonds and the
	secured NRG South Central Generating LLC bonds and Secured LSP
	Energy (Batesville) bonds were downgraded multiple times. After
	NRG Energy failed to make payments due under certain unsecured
	bond obligations on September 16, 2002, both Moodys
	and S&P lowered their ratings on NRG Energys and its
	subsidiaries unsecured bonds once again. Currently, NRG
	Energys unsecured bonds carry a rating of between CCC and
	D at S&P and between Ca and C at Moodys, depending on
	the specific debt issue.


	     

	As a result of the downgrade of NRG Energys
	credit rating, declining power prices, increasing fuel prices,
	the overall down-turn in the energy industry, and the overall
	down-turn in the economy, NRG Energy has experienced severe
	financial difficulties. These difficulties have caused NRG
	Energy to, among other things, miss scheduled principal and
	interest payments due to its corporate lenders and bondholders,
	prepay for fuel and other related delivery and transportation
	services and provide performance collateral in certain
	instances. NRG Energy has also recorded asset impairment charges
	of approximately $3.1 billion, related to various operating
	projects as well as for projects that were under construction
	which NRG Energy has stopped funding.


	     

	NRG Energy and its subsidiaries (including NRG
	South Central) have failed to timely make several interest
	and/or principal payments on its indebtedness. These missed
	payments have resulted in cross-defaults of numerous other
	non-recourse and limited recourse debt instruments of NRG Energy
	and have caused the acceleration of multiple debt instruments of
	NRG Energy, rendering such debt immediately due and payable. For
	more specific information regarding NRG Energys liquidity
	issues, refer to Liquidity Issues in Item 1 of
	Form 10-K filed by NRG Energy on March 31, 2003.


	     

	In addition to the payment defaults described
	above, prior to the downgrades many corporate guarantees and
	commitments of NRG Energy and its subsidiaries required that
	they be supported or replaced with letter of credit or cash
	collateral within 5 to 30 days of a ratings downgrade below
	Baa3 or BBB- by Moodys or Standard & Poors,
	respectively. As a result of the downgrades on July 26 and
	July 29, NRG Energy received demands to post collateral
	aggregating approximately $1.1 billion. NRG Energy is
	presently working with various secured project lender groups
	with respect to the issue of posting collateral and is working
	toward establishing a comprehensive plan of restructuring.


	     

	In August 2002, NRG Energy retained financial and
	legal restructuring advisors to assist its management in the
	preparation of such comprehensive financial and operational
	restructuring. NRG Energy and its advisors have been meeting
	regularly to discuss restructuring issues with an ad hoc
	committee of its bondholders and a steering committee of its
	bank lenders (the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees). In November
	2002, NRG Energy and Xcel Energy presented a comprehensive plan
	of restructuring to the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees. The
	restructuring plan has served as a basis for continuing
	negotiations between the Ad Hoc Creditors Committees, NRG Energy
	and Xcel Energy related to a consensual plan of reorganization
	for NRG Energy. If a comprehensive plan of restructuring is
	ultimately agreed to, it is highly probable that such a plan
	would be implemented through the commencement of a voluntary
	Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. If NRG Energy seeks
	protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, it is
	likely that NRG Energy would also seek such protection for
	certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, which may include NRG South
	Central. For more specific information regarding NRG
	Energys restructuring efforts, refer to Liquidity
	Issues in Item 1 of Form 10-K filed by NRG
	Energy on March 31, 2003.

	On November 22, 2002, five former NRG Energy
	executives filed an involuntary Chapter 11 petition against
	NRG Energy in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
	Minnesota. Under provisions of federal law, NRG Energy has the
	full authority to continue to operate its business as if the
	involuntary petition had not been filed unless and until a court
	hearing on the validity of the involuntary petition is resolved
	adversely to NRG Energy. On December 16, 2002, NRG Energy
	responded to the involuntary petition, contesting the
	petitioners claims and filing a motion to dismiss the
	case. On February 19, 2003, NRG Energy announced that it
	had reached a settlement with the petitioners. The U.S.
	Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota will hear NRG
	Energys motion to approve the settlement and dismiss the
	involuntary petition. Two of NRG Energys creditors have
	objected to the motion to dismiss. There can be no assurance
	that the court will dismiss the involuntary petition. The
	Bankruptcy Court has discretion in the review and approval of
	the settlement agreement. There is a risk that the Bankruptcy
	Court may, among other things, reject the settlement agreement
	or enter an order for relief under Chapter 11.


	     

	On March 26, 2003, Xcel Energy announced
	that its board of directors had approved a tentative settlement
	agreement with holders of most of NRG Energys long-term
	notes and the steering committee representing NRGs bank
	lenders. The settlement is subject to certain conditions,
	including the approval of at least a majority in dollar amount
	of the NRG Energy bank lenders and long-term noteholders and
	definitive documentation. There can be no assurance that such
	approvals will be obtained. The terms of the settlement call for
	Xcel Energy to make payments to NRG Energy over the next
	13 months totaling up to $752 million for the benefit
	of NRG Energys creditors in consideration for their waiver
	of any existing and potential claims against Xcel Energy. Under
	the settlement, Xcel Energy will make the following payments:
	(i) $350 million at or shortly following the
	consummation of a restructuring of NRG Energys debt. It is
	expected this payment would be made prior to year-end 2003;
	(ii) $50 million on January 1, 2004. At Xcel
	Energys option, it may fill this requirement with either
	cash or Xcel Energy common stock or any combination thereof; and
	(iii) $352 million in April 2004.




	     

	NRG South
	Central Indebtedness and Liquidity Issues




	     

	On March 30, 2000, NRG South Central issued
	$800 million of senior secured bonds in two tranches. The
	first tranche was for $500 million with a coupon of 8.962%
	and a maturity of 2016. The second tranche was for
	$300 million with a coupon of 9.479% and a maturity of
	2024. Interest on the bonds is payable in arrears on each
	March 15 and September 15. Principal payments are made
	semi-annually. The proceeds of the bonds were used to finance
	NRG South Centrals acquisition of the Cajun
	generating facilities on March 31, 2000. On
	December 13, 2000, NRG South Central commenced an exchange
	offer of these bonds for registered bonds that contain similar
	terms and conditions. The exchange offer closed on
	January 19, 2001 with all bonds being exchanged. As of
	December 31, 2002 there remains $750.8 million of
	outstanding senior secured bonds, which are classified as
	current. NRG South Central Generating LLC secured bonds
	currently carry a rating of D at S&P and Caa1 at
	Moodys.


	     

	The debt agreements of NRG South Central
	generally restrict its ability to pay dividends, make
	distributions or otherwise transfer funds to NRG Energy under
	certain circumstances such as failure to maintain a required
	minimum debt service ratio. As of December 31, 2002, NRG
	South Central did not meet the minimum debt service coverage
	ratios, and therefore is restricted from making payments to NRG
	Energy.


	     

	NRG South Central Generating is also precluded
	from making payments to NRG Energy due to unfunded debt service
	reserve accounts. Prior to the NRG Energy downgrades (see
	above), the debt service reserve accounts were funded with
	letters of guarantee from NRG Energy. Following the downgrade,
	these accounts were required to be funded with cash from NRG
	Energy within five to thirty days. The accounts were not funded
	with cash from NRG Energy within the respective cure period, and
	an event of default occurred, thereby giving the lenders the
	right to accelerate the project financings. As a result of this
	default, the long-term portion of the debt has been reclassified
	as a current liability, as it is potentially callable within the
	next twelve months. NRG South Central has approximately
	$46.0 million of unfunded debt service reserve commitments
	as of March 31, 2003.

	NRG South Central Generating Assets



	 















	Big Cajun Assets







	     

	The Cajun Facilities, located in New Roads,
	Louisiana, consist of two plants referred to as Big Cajun I
	and Big Cajun II. As of December 31, 2002, the
	aggregate net capable capacity of the Cajun facilities was 1,709
	MW.


	 














	Big Cajun I.






	     

	Big Cajun I, Units 1 and 2, both of
	which are 100% owned by Louisiana Generating, are natural
	gas-fired generating facilities with a net capable capacity of
	110 MW each. Big Cajun I is used for
	intermediate/peaking load seasonal operation and typically runs
	from May through September. As currently configured, Big
	Cajun I produces approximately 1% of the annual electric
	output (as measured in kWh) from the Cajun facilities.


	 














	Big Cajun II.






	     

	Big Cajun II, Units 1, 2 and 3, are coal-fired
	generating facilities. Units 1 and 2 are 100% owned by
	Louisiana Generating and have a net capable capacity of 580 and
	575 MW, respectively. Unit 3 has a net capable
	capacity of 575 MW, of which 58% is owned by Louisiana
	Generating. Entergy Gulf States owns the remaining portion. Big
	Cajun II is a base load facility and runs throughout the
	year. As currently configured, Big Cajun II produces
	approximately 99% of the annual electric output (as measured in
	kWh) from the Cajun facilities.

	Big Cajun I Peaking






	     

	During June, 2001 construction concluded with
	respect to an approximately 238 MW expansion of the Cajun
	facilities. NRG South Central formed Big Cajun I Peaking
	Power, a wholly owned subsidiary, to develop, construct and own
	the expansion project. The energy and capacity generated by the
	expansion project is being marketed by NRG Power Marketing,
	a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy. Louisiana
	Generating purchases the capacity and is entitled to all energy
	from Big Cajun I Peaking. The assets of Big Cajun I
	Peaking have been pledged as collateral under the Peaker
	financing facility.


	 















	Other Generating Assets







	 














	NRG Sterlington






	     

	NRG Sterlington owns and operates an
	approximately 200 MW simple cycle gas peaking facility
	located in Sterlington, Louisiana. Louisiana Generating
	purchases the capacity and is entitled to all energy from NRG
	Sterlington. The assets of NRG Sterlington have been
	pledged as collateral under the Peaker financing facility.


	 














	NRG Bayou Cove






	     

	NRG Bayou Cove was formed to construct, own and
	operate an approximately 320 MW gas-fired peaking
	generating facility located in Jennings, Louisiana. The facility
	became commercially operational in August 2002. The assets of
	NRG Bayou Cove have been pledged as collateral under the
	Peaker financing facility.




	NRG South Central Subsidiaries and
	Operations



	     

	Through its subsidiaries, Louisiana Generating
	and Big Cajun I Peakers, NRG South Central owns the
	Big Cajun I and Big Cajun II generating facilities in
	New Roads, Louisiana (the Cajun facilities). The Cajun
	facilities consist of 100% ownership of four gas-fired
	intermediate/peaking power generation units which
	NRG Energy collectively refers to as Big Cajun I. Two
	of these units were completed and commenced commercial operation
	in June 2001. The Cajun facilities also include 100% interest in
	two coal-fired, base-load power generation units, and a 58%
	interest in a third coal-fired, base load unit, which NRG Energy
	refers to collectively as Big Cajun II. The Cajun facilities
	were acquired through a competitive bidding process following a
	Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Cajun Electric Power
	Cooperative, Inc., a non-profit Louisiana electric membership
	cooperative corporation. Cajun Electric sold wholesale energy
	and capacity generated by the Cajun facilities to its
	cooperative members for more than 20 years under long-term,
	all-requirements power supply agreements. NRG South Central
	sells most of the energy and capacity of the Cajun facilities to
	11 of Cajun Electrics former power cooperative members.
	Seven of these cooperatives have entered into 25-year power
	purchase agreements with NRG South Central, and four have
	entered into two to four year power purchase agreements. In
	addition, NRG South Central sells power under contract to two
	municipal power authorities and one investor-owned utility that
	were former customers of Cajun Electric.


	     

	In March 2000, NRG South Central formed
	NRG New Roads Holdings LLC (New Roads) to hold certain
	assets that were acquired in conjunction with the purchase of
	the Cajun facilities but which are not necessary for the
	operation of the Cajun facilities. NRG Sterlington Power
	LLC (Sterlington), which was acquired by NRG Energy and
	contributed to NRG South Central in August 2000, was formed for
	the purpose of developing, constructing, owning and operating an
	approximately 200 MW simple cycle gas peaking facility in
	Sterlington, Louisiana. Louisiana Generating purchases the
	capacity and is entitled to all energy from
	NRG Sterlington. In December 2000, NRG Sabine River
	Works LP and NRG Sabine River Works GP acquired,
	respectively, a 49% limited partnership interest and a 1%
	general partnership interest in SRW Cogeneration Limited
	Partnership (SRW Cogen), that owns and operates an approximately
	450 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration plant at the DuPont
	Companys Sabine River Works petrochemical facility near
	Orange, Texas. Subsidiaries of Conoco, Inc. owned the other 50%
	interest in SRW Cogen. Commercial operation of the plant
	commenced in November 2001. On November 5, 2002, the
	investment in SRW Cogen was sold to Conoco, Inc for a
	nominal amount and assumption of outstanding obligations.

	During September 2001, NRG Bayou Cove was
	established as a non-guarantor subsidiary of NRG South
	Central Generating. NRG Bayou Cove was formed to construct,
	own and operate approximately 320 MW gas-fired peaking
	generating facility located near Jennings, Louisiana. The
	facility became commercially operational in August 2002.


	     

	NRG Energys energy marketing
	subsidiary, NRG Power Marketing Inc. (NRG Power Marketing),
	provides a full range of energy management services for many of
	NRG Energys generation facilities. These services are
	provided under bilateral contracts or agency agreements pursuant
	to which NRG Power Marketing manages the sales and
	purchases of energy, capacity and ancillary services, procures
	the fuel (coal and natural gas) and associated transportation
	and manages the emission allowance credits for these facilities.
	NRG Power Marketing has continued to provide these services
	since NRG Energy lost its investment grade ratings in July
	2002, and because of NRG Energys credit and liquidity
	limitations, NRG Power Marketing has scaled back its
	activities. Since July 2002, NRG Power Marketing has
	focused primarily on procuring fuel for, and marketing the power
	from, NRG Energys North American generation
	facilities in the spot and short-term markets.




	Regulation



	 















	Environmental and Safety Laws and
	Regulations







	     

	NRG South Central is subject to a broad
	range of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws
	and regulations applicable to the development, ownership and
	operation of its projects. These laws and regulations impose
	requirements relating to discharges of substances to the air,
	water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous
	substances and wastes and the cleanup of properties affected by
	pollutants. These laws and regulations generally require that
	NRG South Central obtain a number of governmental permits
	and approvals before construction or operation of a power plant
	commences and, after completion, that its facilities operate in
	compliance with those permits and applicable legal requirements.
	NRG South Central could also be held responsible under
	these laws for the cleanup of pollutants released at its
	facilities or at off-site locations where it has sent wastes.


	     

	NRG South Central strives at all times to
	comply with the terms of all environmental and safety laws,
	regulations, permits and licenses and NRG South Central
	believes that all of its operating plants are in material
	compliance with applicable environmental and safety
	requirements. NRG South Central also does not expect that
	its liability under environmental laws for the cleanup of
	contamination at its plants or off-site waste disposal
	facilities will have a material effect on the results of its
	operations. NRG South Central cannot assure you, however,
	that in the future it will not incur material environmental
	liabilities, that it will obtain all necessary permits for its
	operations or that it will operate in full compliance with
	environmental and safety laws and regulations at all times. In
	addition, regulatory compliance for the construction of new
	facilities is a costly and time-consuming process. Intricate and
	rapidly changing environmental regulations may require major
	capital expenditures for permitting and create a risk of
	expensive delays or material impairment of project value if
	projects cannot function as planned due to changing regulatory
	requirements or local opposition. Environmental laws have become
	increasingly stringent over time, particularly with regard to
	the regulation of air emissions from NRG South
	Centrals plants, which requires regular major capital
	expenditures for power plant upgrades and modifications.
	Therefore, it is NRG South Centrals policy to
	integrate the consideration of potential environmental impacts
	into every decision it makes, and by doing so, strive to improve
	its competitive advantage by meeting or exceeding environmental
	and safety requirements pertaining to the management and
	operation of its assets. (See Item 7 
	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations  Environmental Matters).


	 















	Energy Regulation







	     

	Various federal and state laws pertaining to
	power generation and sales also affect NRG South Central.
	The Federal Power Act regulates the sale of electricity in the
	wholesale market. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
	(FERC) is an independent agency within The Department of
	Energy that regulates the transmission and wholesale sale of
	electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of The
	Federal



	8








	Table of Contents





	Power Act. FERC is also responsible for licensing
	and inspecting private, municipal and state-owned hydro electric
	projects. FERC determines whether a public utility qualifies for
	exempt wholesale generator status (EWG) under The Public
	Utility Holding Company Act, which was amended by The Energy
	Policy Act of 1992.



	     


	Federal Power Act.



	The Federal Power Act gives FERC
	exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of
	electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate
	commerce. FERC regulates the owners of facilities used for the
	wholesale sale of electricity and its transmission in interstate
	commerce as public utilities under the Federal Power
	Act. The Federal Power Act also gives FERC jurisdiction to
	review certain transactions and numerous other activities of
	public utilities (such as the granting of waivers of certain of
	the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that
	are imposed on public utilities with cost-based rate schedules).


	     

	Under the Federal Power Act, an entity that sells
	electricity in the wholesale market is a public utility, subject
	to FERCs jurisdiction. Public utilities are required to
	obtain FERCs acceptance of their rate schedules for
	wholesale sales of electricity. Because NRG South Centrals
	operating subsidiaries sell energy and capacity in the wholesale
	market, they are deemed to be public utilities for purposes of
	the Federal Power Act. In most cases, FERC has granted the NRG
	South Central operating companies the authority to sell
	electricity at market-based rates. In New England, New York, PJM
	(Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and parts of the
	Midwest) the Midwest and California, FERC has established
	Independent System Operators (ISOs) which file market based rate
	tariffs, subject to FERC Approval. These tariffs/market rules
	dictate how the wholesale markets are to operate and how
	entities with market based rates shall be compensated within
	those markets. The ISOs in these regions also control access to,
	pricing of and the operation of the transmission grid within
	their footprint. Outside of ISO controlled regions, NRG South
	Central is allowed to sell at market based rates as determined
	by willing buyers and sellers. Access to, pricing for and
	operation of the transmission grid in such regions is controlled
	by the local transmission owning utility according to their Pro
	Forma Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) filed with and
	approved by FERC.


	     

	Usually, FERCs orders which grant NRG South
	Central market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke
	or revise the market-based rate authority on a prospective basis
	if FERC subsequently determines that NRG South Central possesses
	excessive market power. If NRG South Central lost its
	market-based rate authority, NRG South Central may be required
	to obtain FERCs acceptance of a cost-of-service rate
	schedule and may become subject to the accounting,
	record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed only
	on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. It should be noted,
	however, that NRG South Central does have the right at any time
	to petition FERC to grant cost of service based rates pursuant
	to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.


	     


	Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA).



	The Public Utility Holding Company
	Act, known as PUHCA, provides that any entity that owns,
	controls or has the power to vote 10% or more of the outstanding
	voting securities of an electric utility company, or
	a holding company for an electric utility company, is subject to
	regulation under PUHCA.


	     

	Registered holding companies under PUHCA are
	required to limit their utility operations to a single,
	integrated utility system and divest any other operations that
	are not functionally related to the operation of the utility
	system. In addition, a company that is a subsidiary of a holding
	company registered under PUHCA is subject to financial and
	organizational regulation, including approval by the SEC of
	certain financings and transactions. Under the Energy Policy Act
	of 1992, however, FERC can determine that a company engaged
	exclusively in the business of owning or operating an eligible
	facility used for the generation of electric energy for sale at
	wholesale is an EWG. Accordingly, it is exempt from PUHCA
	requirements. In the case of facilities previously operated by
	regulated utilities, FERC can make an exempt wholesale generator
	determination only after the state utility commission finds that
	allowing the facility or facilities to be eligible for exempt
	wholesale generator status will benefit consumers, is in the
	public interest, and does not violate state law. Each of NRG
	South Centrals operating subsidiaries has been designated
	by FERC as an EWG or is otherwise exempt from PUHCA because it
	is a Qualifying Facility under the Public Utility Regulatory
	Policy Act of 1978.

	Table of Contents




	     

	NRG South Central does not expect to engage in
	any activities that will subject it to regulation under PUHCA.
	If NRG South Central were to lose its EWG status, it would
	become subject to regulation under PUHCA. It would be difficult
	for NRG South Central to comply with PUHCA absent a substantial
	restructuring.


	 














	State Energy Regulation






	     

	With the exception of the provision of utility
	services by certain utilities in New Orleans and certain
	municipal utilities, the Louisiana Public Service Commission, or
	LPSC, regulates all public utilities within Louisiana. The
	jurisdiction of the, Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC),
	over these public utilities generally includes authority to
	regulate the rates, services and securities of any entity
	furnishing electric service in the state. However, Louisiana law
	does not specifically address the status of entities providing
	electricity exclusively in the wholesale market. The LPSC has
	recognized that FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale rates.
	However, the 11 distribution cooperatives to which
	Louisiana Generating sells a majority of the energy and capacity
	generated by the Cajun facilities will continue to be regulated
	by the LPSC.


	     

	NRG South Centrals Louisiana Generating
	production facilities provide a substantial amount of their
	power production to four Louisiana power distribution
	cooperatives under multi-year Form C contracts.
	Those contracts are currently set to expire in 2004. NRG South
	Central has negotiated replacement contracts with the
	cooperatives having terms of five to ten years. Those
	replacements are subject to LPSC and FERC approval. The LPSC is
	currently evaluating those contracts. FERC action will follow
	LPSC action on these contracts. There can be no assurance that
	the LPSC or FERC will ultimately approve those contracts as
	negotiated or at all.




	Competition



	     

	The entire independent power industry in the
	United States is in turmoil. Many of NRG South Centrals
	competitors have announced plans to scale back their growth,
	sell assets, and restructure their finances. The results of the
	wholesale restructuring of the independent power industry are
	impossible to predict, but they may include consolidation within
	the industry, the sale or liquidation of certain competitors,
	the re-regulation of certain markets, and the long-term
	reduction in new investment into the industry. Under any
	scenario, however, NRG South Central anticipates that it will
	continue to face competition from numerous companies in the
	industry, some of which may have more extensive operating
	experience, larger staffs, and greater financial resources than
	NRG South Central presently possesses.


	     

	Many companies in the regulated utility industry,
	with which the independent power industry is closely linked, are
	also restructuring or reviewing their strategies. Several of
	these companies are discontinuing going forward with unregulated
	investments, seeking to divest of their unregulated subsidiaries
	or attempting to have their regulated subsidiaries acquire their
	unregulated subsidiaries. This may lead to an increased
	competition between the regulated utilities and the unregulated
	power producers within certain markets. In such instances, NRG
	South Central may compete with regulated utilities in the
	development of market designs and rulemaking.


	     

	FERC, however, is attempting to level the
	competitive playing field between regulated utilities and
	unregulated energy suppliers by providing open,
	non-discriminatory access to electricity markets and the
	transmission grid. In April 1996, FERC issued Orders 888 and 889
	that required all public utilities to file open
	access transmission tariffs that give wholesale
	generators, as well as other wholesale sellers and buyers of
	electricity, access to transmission facilities on a
	non-discriminatory basis. This led to the formation of the ISOs
	described above. On December 20, 1999, FERC issued
	Order 2000, encouraging the creation of Regional
	Transmission Organizations (RTOs). Finally, on July 31,
	2002, FERC issued its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding
	Standard Market Design. All three orders were intended to
	eliminate market discrimination by incumbent vertically
	integrated utilities and to provide for open access to the
	transmission grid.


	     

	The full effect of these changes on NRG South
	Central is uncertain at this time, because in many parts of the
	United States, it has not been determined how entities will
	attempt to comply with FERCs initiatives. At

	this time, five ISOs have been approved and are
	operational; New England (ISO-NE), New York (NYISO),
	Pennsylvania, NJ, Maryland, DE and parts of the midwest
	(collectively PJM), Central Midwest (MISO), South Central
	(SPP) and in California (CA ISO). Two of these ISOs, PJM
	and MISO, have been found to also qualify as RTOs. Three other
	entities have also requested that FERC approve their
	organizations as RTOs; WestConnect (Desert Southwest); RTO West
	(Pacific Northwest and Rockies) and Setrans (Southeast).



	     

	In the Southeast, Entergy and Southern Company
	continue to support their RTO, Setrans. The future of Setrans is
	uncertain given the recent loss of Santee Cooper.


	     

	Proposals have been introduced in Congress to
	repeal PURPA and PUHCA, and FERC has publicly indicated support
	for the PUHCA repeal effort. If the repeal of PURPA or PUHCA
	occurs, either separately or as part of legislation designed to
	encourage the broader introduction of wholesale and retail
	competition, the significant competitive advantages that
	independent power producers currently enjoy over certain
	regulated utility companies would be eliminated or sharply
	curtailed, and the ability of regulated utility companies to
	compete more directly with independent power companies would be
	increased. To the extent competitive pressures increase and the
	pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of
	a commodity business, the economics of domestic independent
	power generation projects may come under increasing pressure.
	Deregulation may not only continue to fuel the current trend
	toward consolidation among domestic utilities, but may also
	encourage the dis-aggregation of vertically-integrated utilities
	into separate generation, transmission and distribution
	businesses.


	     

	In addition, the independent system operators who
	oversee most of the wholesale power markets have in the past
	imposed, and may in the future continue to impose, price caps
	and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these
	markets. For example, the independent system operator for the
	New York power pool and the California independent system
	operator have imposed price caps. These types of price caps and
	other mechanisms in New York, California, the New England Power
	Pool and elsewhere may adversely impact the profitability of NRG
	Energys and NRG South Centrals generation facilities
	that sell energy into the wholesale power markets. Finally, the
	regulatory and legislative changes that have recently been
	enacted in a number of states in an effort to promote
	competition are novel and untested in many respects. These new
	approaches to the sale of electric power have very short
	operating histories, and it is not yet clear how they will
	operate in times of market stress or pressure, given the extreme
	volatility and lack of meaningful long-term price history in
	many of these markets and the imposition of price caps by
	independent system operators.




	Power Markets



	     

	NRG South Central sells energy and capacity
	generated primarily from the Cajun facilities to cooperative
	customers under mostly fixed-price long term agreements in the
	southeast power markets, primarily in Louisiana. In addition,
	through NRG Power Marketing, NRG South Central sells excess
	energy and capacity into neighboring regions.


	 















	Southeast Power Market







	     

	The southeast power market consists of Louisiana,
	Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, northwest
	Florida and east Texas. State public utilities commissions and
	state assemblies within the southeast power market have been
	slower than other parts of the country to restructure the
	electricity industry. Most states in the southeast power market,
	including Louisiana, have decided not to pursue retail
	competition immediately, deciding instead to observe the impact
	of direct retail access on other states that have taken a more
	aggressive approach towards restructuring. Texas is the only
	state in the southeast power market that is has implemented
	industry restructuring legislation.


	     

	The southeast power market is currently a
	bilateral market functioning without an independent
	system operator, a power pool or a price exchange. Therefore,
	all scheduling, coordination and market pricing are determined
	on a control area basis by each market entity rather than by a
	single pool market clearing house.

	Significant Customers



	     

	Cajun Electric was a rural electric generation
	and transmission cooperative formed in 1962 and was wholly-owned
	by its members, the distribution cooperatives. The distribution
	cooperatives purchased their electric energy requirements from
	Cajun Electric for more than 20 years under long-term, all
	requirements power supply agreements. Following NRG South
	Centrals acquisition of the Cajun facilities, all 11 of
	the distribution cooperatives continued to purchase their
	electric energy requirements from Louisiana Generating. For the
	years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, revenues derived
	from agreements with the distribution cooperatives accounted for
	approximately 72.6% and 70.9% of NRG South Centrals total
	revenues, respectively. In total, NRG South Central derived
	approximately 80.8% and 78.4% of its revenues for the years
	ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, from long-term,
	all-requirements power supply agreements with the distribution
	cooperatives and other wholesale customers.


	     

	During 2002, two customers accounted for 32.8% of
	NRG South Centrals gross revenues, Southwest Louisiana
	Electric Membership Corporation (16.9%) and Dixie Electric
	Membership Corporation (15.9%). During 2001, two customers
	accounted for 32.1% of NRG South Centrals gross revenues,
	Southwest Louisiana Electric Membership Corporation (16.4%) and
	Dixie Electric Membership Corporation (15.7%).




	Employees



	     

	As of December 31, 2002, Louisiana
	Generating had 197 union and 134 non-union employees. With
	respect to union employees, all such employees are covered by
	current labor agreements with either the United Steelworkers of
	America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
	These agreements were renewed in March 2001 and expire
	April 1, 2006. No significant labor stoppages or disputes
	have been experienced by NRG South Central. NRG South Central
	does not have any employees.




	Seasonality and Price Volatility



	     

	Annual and quarterly operating results can be
	significantly affected by weather and price volatility.
	Significant other events, such as the war in Iraq and the
	precipitous decline in natural gas inventories and productive
	capacity, have combined to increase fuel and power price
	volatility.




	Sources and Availability of Raw
	Materials



	     

	NRG South Centrals raw material
	requirements primarily include various forms of fossil fuel
	energy sources, including natural gas and coal. NRG South
	Central obtains its natural gas and coal from multiple sources
	and availability is generally not an issue, although localized
	shortages can and do occur. The prices of natural gas and coal
	are subject to macro- and micro-economic forces that can change
	dramatically in both the short term and the long term. For
	example, the prices of natural gas and oil have been
	particularly high during the winter of 2002-2003 due to weather
	volatility and geo-political uncertainty in the Middle East.
	Natural gas and coal represented approximately 54.4% of NRG
	South Centrals cost of operations during the year ended
	December 31, 2002.


	 















	Coal Supplier and
	Transporters







	     

	Louisiana Generating has a coal supply agreement
	with Triton Coal for a term of five years, which began in March
	2000. Triton Coal headquartered in Gillette, Wyoming, operates
	two coal mines in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.


	     

	Louisiana Generating has a coal transportation
	agreement with Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway and
	American Commercial Marine Services Company (ACMSC) for a
	term of five years, which began in March 2000. Burlington
	Northern and Santa Fe Railway, headquartered in Fort Worth,
	Texas, transport a variety of manufacturing, agricultural and
	natural resource commodities, chemicals, consumer and food
	products, and motor vehicles and automotive parts. ACMSC,
	headquartered in Jeffersonville, Indiana, is a general cargo
	stevedore and warehousing logistics specialist which operates a
	bulk dry cargo and liquid barge line, and terminal offering rail
	and truck trans-loading for a variety of commodities including
	steel, paper,



	12








	Table of Contents





	lumber and coal. ACMSC filed for Chapter 11
	bankruptcy protection in February 2003 and is currently
	operating as a debtor in possession under bankruptcy. Louisiana
	Generating cannot determine the impact of this bankruptcy on
	Louisiana Generating at this time.



	 















	Natural Gas Supply







	     

	The Cajun facilities include a 17.5 mile natural
	gas pipeline with interconnections to Bridgeline Gas
	Distribution LLC, Acadian Gas Pipeline System and Texas Eastern
	Transmission Corporation. Under the power sales agreement, NRG
	Power Marketing may acquire natural gas and gas transportation
	rights for NRG South Centrals benefit.

NRG Energy confirms South Central Generating LLC debt acceleration








11/22/2002


























Sponsored by












MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Nov. 22, 2002 -- NRG South Central Generating LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc., Thursday received a notice of acceleration from the bond trustee, on behalf of bondholders, for its 8.962 percent senior secured series A-1 bonds due 2016 and its 9.479 percent senior secured series B-1 bonds due 2024.The notice of acceleration renders the approximately $750 million in debt, which is nonrecourse to NRG Energy, immediately due and payable.Based on discussions with the bondholders, it is NRG's understanding that the bond trustee issued the acceleration notice to preserve certain rights, and NRG continues negotiations with bondholders."We will continue to work with our lenders toward an overall restructuring of NRG's debt," said Richard C. Kelly, NRG president and chief operating officer. "We do not believe that the NRG South Central Generating bondholders' action will negatively affect the course of those discussions."NRG South Central Generating defaulted on the bonds when it did not make approximately $47 million in combined principal and interest payments, due September 15, on the two bond issuances and did not make the required payments before the 15-day grace period expired.NRG Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy, develops and operates power-generating facilities. Its operations include competitive energy production and cogeneration facilities, thermal energy production and energy resource recovery facilities.[Native Advertisement]Xcel Energy is a major U.S. electricity and natural gas company with regulated operations in 12 Western and Midwestern states. The company provides a comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services to 3.2 million electricity customers and 1.7 million natural gas customers through its regulated operating companies. In terms of customers, it is the fourth-largest combination natural gas and electricity company in the United States. Company headquarters are located in Minneapolis.Source: NRG Energy, Inc.

NRG SOUTH CENTRAL GENERATING LLC - 10-K405 - 20020401 - PART_I













	Part I















	Item 1Business








	General






	        NRG South Central Generating LLC (NRG South Central or the Company), is a Delaware limited liability company, which, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
	Louisiana Generating LLC (Louisiana Generating), NRG New Roads Holdings LLC, NRG Sterlington Power LLC, Big Cajun I Peaking Power LLC (Big Cajun 1 Peakers), NRG Sabine River Works GP LLC, NRG Sabine
	River Works LP LLC, and NRG Bayou Cove LLC (NRG Bayou Cove), owns approximately 2,679 MW of net electric generating capacity as of December 31, 2001 (including projects under construction).




	        NRG
	South Central is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG Energy), a global energy company. Established in 1989, NRG Energy is primarily engaged in the
	acquisition, development, ownership and operation of power generation facilities and the sale of energy, capacity and related products. NRG Energy owns 100% of both NRG Central U.S. LLC and South
	Central Generation Holding LLC, each of which own a 50% membership interest in NRG South Central.




	        On
	June 5, 2000, NRG Energy completed its initial public offering. Prior to its initial public offering, NRG Energy was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern States Power Company
	(NSP). In August 2000, NSP and New Century Energies, Inc. completed their merger. The shares of NRG Energy class A common stock previously owned by NSP are now owned by Xcel
	Energy Inc. (Xcel Energy). As of December 31, 2001, Xcel owned an approximately 74% interest in NRG Energy's outstanding common and class A common stock, representing
	approximately 97% of the total voting power of NRG Energy's common and class A common stock. Xcel Energy directly owns six utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in
	twelve states. Xcel Energy also owns or has interest in a number of non-regulated businesses, the largest of which is NRG Energy.




	        Through
	its subsidiaries, Louisiana Generating and Big Cajun 1 Peakers, NRG South Central owns the Big Cajun I and Big Cajun II generating facilities in New Roads, Louisiana (the Cajun
	facilities). The Cajun facilities consist of 100% ownership of four gas-fired intermediate/peaking power generation units which NRG Energy collectively refers to as Big Cajun I. Two of
	these units were completed and commenced commercial operation in June 2001. The Cajun facilities also include 100% interest in two coal-fired, base-load power generation
	units, and a 58% interest in a third coal-fired, base load unit, which NRG Energy refers to collectively as Big Cajun II. The Cajun facilities were acquired through a competitive bidding
	process following a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc., a non-profit Louisiana electric membership cooperative corporation. Cajun Electric sold
	wholesale energy and capacity generated by the Cajun facilities to its cooperative members for more than 20 years under long-term, all-requirements power supply
	agreements. NRG South Central sells most of the energy and capacity of the Cajun facilities to 11 of Cajun Electric's former power cooperative members. Seven of these cooperatives have entered into
	25-year power purchase agreements with NRG South Central, and four have entered into two to four year power purchase agreements. In addition, NRG South Central sells power under contract
	to two municipal power authorities and one investor-owned utility that were former customers of Cajun Electric.




	        In
	March 2000, NRG South Central formed NRG New Roads Holdings LLC (New Roads) to hold certain assets that were acquired in conjunction with the purchase of the Cajun facilities
	but which are not necessary for the operation of the Cajun facilities. NRG Sterlington Power LLC (Sterlington), which was acquired by NRG Energy and contributed to NRG South Central in
	August 2000, was formed for the purpose of developing, constructing, owning and operating an approximately 202 MW simple cycle gas peaking facility in Sterlington, Louisiana. Louisiana
	Generating purchases the capacity and is entitled to all energy from NRG Sterlington. In December 2000, NRG Sabine River Works LP and NRG Sabine River Works GP acquired, respectively, a 49%
	limited partnership interest and a 1% general partnership interest in SRW Cogeneration Limited Partnership (SRW Cogen), that owns and




	1









	operates an approximately 420 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration plant at the DuPont Company's Sabine River Works petrochemical facility near Orange, Texas. Subsidiaries of
	Conoco, Inc. own the other 50% interest in SRW Cogeneration Limited Partnership. Commercial operation of the plant commenced in November 2001.




	        During
	September 2001, NRG Bayou Cove was established as a non-guarantor subsidiary of NRG South Central Generating. NRG Bayou Cove was formed to construct, own and operate
	approximately 320 MW gas-fired peaking generating facility located near Jennings, Louisiana. The facility is currently under construction and expected to be commercially operationally in
	October 2002.




	        NRG
	South Central's headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 901 Marquette Avenue, Suite 2300, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402. NRG South Central's phone number is
	(612) 373 - 5300.





	Xcel Energy Exchange Offer





	        In February 2002, Xcel Energy announced its intention to commence an exchange offer by which Xcel Energy would acquire all of the outstanding publicly held shares
	of NRG Energy. In its announcement, Xcel Energy stated its intention to close the transaction in April 2002, and stated that NRG Energy shareholders would receive 0.4846 shares of Xcel Energy common
	stock in a tax-free exchange for each outstanding share of NRG Energy common stock.




	        After
	completion of the merger, NRG Energy would be an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy. NRG Energy's debt and other obligations will continue to be the sole obligation
	of NRG Energy.




	        On
	March 13, 2002, Xcel Energy filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commenced an exchange offer. In its registration
	statement. Xcel Energy stated that, if the exchange offer and merger are completed, its plan for NRG Energy in 2002 include: infusing an additional $300 million of equity into NRG Energy in addition
	to an initial loan of $300 million recently made to NRG Energy; slowing NRG Energy's growth in megawatt capacity and the possible sale of $1.9 billion of existing generating assets; cancelling or
	deferring approximately $1.6 billion of planned projects; and beginning the process of selling unassigned turbines and deferring installment of additional unassigned turbines.




	        In
	addition, Xcel Energy stated in its registration statement that if the offer and merger are completed and its plans for NRG Energy are implemented, it expects to reduce NRG Energy's
	business development activities and administrative and general costs, with annual estimated cost savings of approximately $45 million, and to capture infrastructure savings by consolidating trading
	and marketing organizations, where appropriate.





	The Cajun Facilities





	        The Cajun Facilities, located in New Roads, Louisiana, consist of two plants referred to as Big Cajun I and Big Cajun II. As of December 31, 2001, the
	aggregate net capable capacity of the Cajun facilities was 1,709 MW.





	        Big Cajun I.



	    Big Cajun I, Units 1 and 2, both of which are 100% owned by Louisiana Generating, are natural
	gas-fired generating facilities with a net capable capacity of 110 MW each. Big Cajun I is used for intermediate/peaking load seasonal operation and typically runs from May through
	September. As currently configured, Big Cajun I produces approximately 1% of the annual electric output (as measured in kWh) from the Cajun facilities.





	        Big Cajun II.



	    Big Cajun II, Units 1, 2 and 3, are coal-fired generating facilities. Units 1 and 2 are 100% owned
	by Louisiana Generating and each have a net capable capacity of 580 and 575 MW,




	2








	respectively. Unit 3 has a net capable capacity of 575 MW, of which 58% is owned by Louisiana Generating. Entergy Gulf States owns the remaining portion. Big Cajun II is a base load facility and runs
	throughout the year. As currently configured, Big Cajun II produces approximately 99% of the annual electric output (as measured in kWh) from the Cajun facilities.




	        During
	June, 2001 construction concluded with respect to an approximately 238 MW expansion of the Cajun facilities. NRG South Central formed Big Cajun I Peaking Power, a wholly owned
	subsidiary, to develop, construct and own the expansion project. The energy and capacity generated by the expansion project is used to help meet NRG South Central's obligations under the existing
	power purchase agreements, with any excess power and capacity being marketed by NRG Power Marketing, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy.





	Other Facilities





	        NRG Sterlington owns and operates an approximately 202 MW simple cycle gas peaking facility located in Sterlington, Louisiana. Louisiana Generating purchases the
	capacity and is entitled to all energy from NRG Sterlington.




	        NRG
	Bayou Cove was formed to construct, own and operate an approximately 320 MW gas-fired peaking generating facility located in Jennings, Louisiana. The facility is
	currently under construction and expected to be commercially operational in October 2002.






	Regulation






	        NRG South Central is subject to a broad range of federal, state and local energy and environmental laws and regulations applicable to the development, ownership
	and operation of its projects. These laws and regulations generally require that a number of permits and approvals be obtained before construction or operation of a power plant commences and that,
	after completion, the facility operate in compliance with local requirements. NRG South Central strives to comply with the terms of all such laws, regulations, permits and licenses and believes that
	all of its operating plants are in material compliance with all such applicable requirements. No assurance can be given, however, that in the future all necessary permits and approvals will be
	obtained and all applicable statutes and regulations will be complied with. In addition, regulatory compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly and time-consuming
	process, and intricate and rapidly changing environmental regulations may require major expenditures for permitting and create the risk of expensive delays or material impairment of project value if
	projects cannot function as planned due to changing regulatory
	requirements or local opposition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that existing regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to NRG South
	Central which would have an adverse impact on its operations.





	        General.



	    NRG South Central and its subsidiaries, like most industrial enterprises, are subject to regulation with respect to
	the environmental impact of their operations, including air and water quality control, limitations on land use, disposal of wastes, aesthetics and other matters.





	        Federal Power Act.



	    The Federal Power Act gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) exclusive ratemaking
	jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, all public utilities subject to FERC's jurisdiction are
	required to file rate schedules with FERC prior to commencement of wholesale sales or transmission of electricity. Because Louisiana Generating sells energy and capacity in the wholesale market, it is
	deemed to be a public utility for purposes of the Federal Power Act and has been granted this authority by FERC. In its orders, FERC also granted waivers of certain of the accounting, record-keeping
	and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with cost-based rate schedules.




	3









	        In
	addition, FERC's orders, as is customary with market-based rate schedules, reserve the right to suspend, upon complaint, market-based rate authority on a prospective basis if it is
	subsequently determined that market power was exercised. If FERC were to suspend market-based rate authority, it would most likely be necessary to file, and obtain FERC acceptance of,
	cost-based rate schedules. In addition, the loss of market-based rate authority would likely subject NRG South Central to the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are
	imposed on public utilities with cost-based rate schedules.




	        



	Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA).



	A public utility company that is a subsidiary of a registered holding company under PUHCA is
	subject to financial and organizational regulation, including approval by the SEC of certain of its financing transactions. However, under the Energy Policy Act, a company engaged exclusively in the
	business of owning and/or operating a facility used for the generation of electric energy exclusively for sale at wholesale may be exempted from PUHCA regulation by means of its status as an Exempt
	Wholesale Generator (EWG), as defined under Section 32 of PUHCA. Louisiana Generating and all of NRG South Central's subsidiaries are EWGs, and have received confirmation from FERC of their EWG
	status.




	        If
	Louisiana Generating or any other of NRG South Central's subsidiairies were to lose their EWG status, they would be subject to regulation as a public utility company and certain of
	its affiliates would be subject to regulation under PUHCA as public utility holding companies. Absent a substantial restructuring of NRG South Central's business, it would be difficult to comply with
	PUHCA without a material adverse effect on its business.





	        State Law.



	    With the exception of the provision of utility services by certain utilities in New Orleans and certain municipal
	utilities, the Louisiana Public Service Commission, or LPSC, regulates all public utilities within Louisiana. The jurisdiction of the, Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC), over these public
	utilities generally includes authority to regulate the rates, services and securities of any entity furnishing electric service in the state. However, Louisiana law does not specifically address the
	status of entities providing electricity exclusively at wholesale. The LPSC has recognized that FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale rates. However, the 11 distribution cooperatives to which Louisiana
	Generating sells a majority of the energy and capacity generated by the Cajun facilities will continue to be regulated by the LPSC.






	Customers






	        Cajun Electric was a rural electric generation and transmission cooperative formed in 1962 and was wholly-owned by its members, the distribution cooperatives. The
	distribution cooperatives purchased their electric energy requirements from Cajun Electric for more than 20 years under long-term, all requirements power supply agreements.
	Following NRG South Central's acquisition of the Cajun facilities, all 11 of the distribution cooperatives continued to purchase their electric energy requirements from Louisiana Generating. For the
	year ended December 31, 2001, revenues derived from agreements with the distribution cooperatives accounted for approximately 70.9% of NRG South Central's total revenues. In total, NRG South
	Central derived approximately 78.4% of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 from long-term, all-requirements power supply agreements with the distribution cooperatives and other
	wholesale customers.




	        During
	the year-ended December 31, 2001, sales to two customers, Southwest Louisiana Electric Membership Corporation, and Dixie Electric Membership Corporation,
	accounted for approximately 16.4%, and 15.7% of NRG South Central's total revenues, respectively.




	        Customers
	of Sterlington and Big Cajun I Peakers are the same customers as Louisiana Generating. SRW supplies steam and power to E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and sells merchant
	power primarily in the Southeast Energy Reliability Council (SERC)/Entergy region through NRG Power Marketing.

	Power Markets






	        NRG South Central sells energy and capacity generated primarily by the Cajun facilities in the southeast power market, primarily in Louisiana. In addition,
	through NRG Power Marketing, NRG South Central sells excess energy and capacity into the SERC region or into other neighboring regions.





	Southeast Power Market





	        The southeast power market consists of Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, northwest Florida and east Texas. State public utilities
	commissions and state assemblies within the southeast power market have been slower than other parts of the country to restructure the electricity industry. Most states in the southeast power market,
	including Louisiana, have decided not to pursue retail competition immediately, deciding instead to observe the impact of direct retail access on other states that have taken a more aggressive
	approach towards restructuring. Texas is the only state in the southeast power market that is moving forward with industry restructuring legislation.




	        The
	southeast power market is currently a "bilateral market" functioning without an independent system operator, a power pool or a price exchange. Therefore, all scheduling, coordination
	and market pricing are determined on a control area basis by each market entity rather than by a single pool market clearing house.






	Employees






	        As of December 31, 2001, Louisiana Generating had 200 union and 139 non-union employees. With respect to union employees, all such employees
	are covered by current labor agreements with either the United Steelworkers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. These agreements were renewed in March 2001 and
	expire April 1, 2006. No significant labor stoppages or disputes have been experienced by NRG South Central. NRG South Central does not have any employees.






	Coal Supplier and Transporters






	        Louisiana Generating has a coal supply agreement with Triton Coal for a term of five years, which began in March 2000. Triton Coal headquartered in
	Gillette, Wyoming, operates two coal mines in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.




	        Louisiana
	Generating has a coal transportation agreement with Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway and American Commercial Terminal for a term of five years, which began in
	March 2000. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, transport a variety of manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource commodities, chemicals,
	consumer and food products, and motor vehicles and automotive parts. American Commercial Terminal, headquartered in Jeffersonville, Indiana, is a general cargo stevedore and warehousing logistics
	specialist which operates a terminal offering barge, rail and truck trans-loading for a variety of commodities including steel, paper, lumber and coal.






	Natural Gas Supply






	        The Cajun facilities include a 17.5 mile natural gas pipeline with interconnections to Bridgeline Gas Distribution LLC, Acadian Gas Pipeline System and Texas
	Eastern Transmission Corporation. Under the power sales agreement, NRG Power Marketing may acquire natural gas and gas transportation rights for NRG South Central's benefit.




	5

















	Environmental Matters






	        Approximately $35 Million over the next five years has been ear marked for the addition of NOX controls to Units 1-3 at Big Cajun II;
	$5-10 Million over the same time period is reserved for NOX controls on the steam boilers at Big Cajun I. These expenditures appear to be in response to a change in law and, therefore,
	recoverable via pass-through to the Co-operatives. Approximately $4-5 Million will be spent over the next two years to reduce particulate matter emissions during start-up of the Big
	Cajun II boilers and $3-5 Million for expanding the existing boiling ash pond at the Big Cajun II plant site. Neither of these capital expenditures is related to a change in law.






	Remediation






	        Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of any facility, including an electric
	generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate past releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products located at the facility, and may be held
	liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by the party in connection with any releases or threatened
	releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive




	Environmental
	Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or
	caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict and joint and several. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of any
	hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products could be substantial. NRG South Central believes, however, that the risk of material remediation liability in connection with its ownership and
	operation of the Cajun facilities is low because they were "Greenfield" facilities when constructed and had no history of large off-site shipments of hazardous waste from the facilities.
	During 2001 and 2000 there were no significant expenditures made for environmental remediation type costs and none are expected in the near future.

	Other Facilities






	        NRG New Roads Holdings LLC owns certain assets acquired in conjunction with the purchase of the Cajun facilities, including land, mineral rights and a 540 MW
	General Electric steam turbine generator.















	Item 3Legal Proceedings






	        On July 5, 2001, PG&E Energy Trading Power, L.P. (PGET), a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation, filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration
	Association stating a claim against SRW Cogeneration Limited Partnership (SRW). SRW is a Delaware limited partnership that owns and operates an approximately 420 MW natural gas-fired
	cogeneration plant at the DuPont Company's
	Sabine River Works petrochemcial facility near Orange, Texas. SRW is 50% owned by Sabine River Works LP and Sabine River Works GP. The remaining 50% of SRW is owned by subsidiaries of
	Conoco Inc.




	        PGET
	and SRW had entered into a Tolling Agreement under which PGET was to provide gas to SRW for use in generating electricity, a portion of which would be delivered to PGET. Under the
	Tolling Agreement, both parties provided a corporate guarantee for the performance of their respective obligations under the agreement. PGET's corporate guarantor was its ultimate parent, PG&E
	Corporation, whose credit rating dropped from the level required to be maintained under the terms of the Tolling Agreement, and SRW exercised its right to terminate the Tolling Agreement.




	        PGET
	is challenging that termination. In its arbitration petition, it is claiming damages for SRW's failure to deliver power to PGET pursuant to the Tolling Agreement and for SRW's
	failure to accept natural gas from PGET pursuant to the Tolling Agreement. PGET alleges that the amount in dispute is in excess of $100 million. SRW considers that it properly terminated the
	Tolling Agreement in full accordance with the Tolling Agreement's express and unambiguous terms, and that PGET is not entitled to the relief sought. SRW has counterclaimed for damages in excess of
	$100,000 and will continue vigorously to defend this claim.




	        There
	are no other material legal proceedings pending, to which NRG South Central or any of its subsidiaries are a party. There are no material legal proceedings to which an officer or
	director is a party or has a material interest adverse to NRG South Central or its subsidiaries.




	        There
	are no material administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality or civil rights statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies to
	which NRG South Central is or would be a party.
