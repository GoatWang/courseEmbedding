Reef Oil & Gas Partnerships Investment Losses | Blau & Malmfeldt Investigations



















REEF OIL & GAS INVESTMENT LOSSES




Have you suffered losses in a Reef Oil & Gas Partnership? 
      
      
 Blau & Malmfeldt is investigating the liability that broker dealer firms may have for selling limited partnership interests and promissory notes in various Reef Oil and Gas partnerships.  These partnerships include Reef SWD 2007-A LP, Reef 2010 Drilling Fund LP, Reef Oil & Gas Development Fund, Reef Oil & Gas Development Fund II, LP, Reef Oil & Gas Development Fund III, LP, Reef 2010 Drilling Fund, Reef Global Energy VI, LP, Reef 2011 Private Drilling Fund LP, among others. 
 In 2010, Reef SWD 2007-A LP ("Reef SWD") filed for bankruptcy protection, and in 2013 the bankruptcy proceeding was concluded.  Investors recieved only pennies on the dollar through the bankruptcy proceeding.  
 In December 2007 Reef SWD filed a notice of private securities offerings with the Securities & Exchange Commission through which it indicated that it intended to sell $11M of private partnership interests and that of the offering proceeds $1.65M would be reserved for sales commissions.  In other words, for each dollar raised, 15 cents was paid to Reef SWD's sponsor and to various brokerage firms.  The same appears to have been true for the other Reef Oil & Gas partnerships.  
 Many brokerage firms misled investors about the risks associated with oil and gas partnerships and concealed the sales commissions from them. These were always extremely risky investments, and brokerage firms often ignored their customers' welfare in pursuit of the huge commissions that they received on the sale of these investments. In addition, many brokerage firms improperly recommended that their customers concentrate their savings in oil and gas partnerships and other private placement securities. 
Reef Oil & Gas losses may be recoverable in arbitration. If you believe that you were misled about the risks of a Reef Oil & Gas investment, or if your broker recommended that you concentrate your savings in oil and gas investments, 
please contact us for a free consultation.

QUESTIONS

How can I invest in oil and natural gas?


There are many ways to invest in oil and gas including buying stock directly in an oil and gas company, oil and gas mutual funds, commodity trading, and investing directly with independent oil and gas companies like Reef Oil and Gas.




What are the advantages of investing in oil and gas?


Some advantages of investing in an oil and natural gas program are potential cash flow, capital gains from the sale of interest and possible tax efficiencies.




What is Reef's expertise in the industry?


Reef Oil and Gas Companies was formed in 1987 and has more than 25 years experience in the industry. Reef has a team of Geologists, Geophysicists, Reservoir Engineers, Production Engineers and Landmen, most of which are highly-trained industry veterans with more than 30 years average experience. Reef currently owns an interest in more than 3,000 wells across the U.S.




Does Reef use the latest drilling technology?


Yes. Reef Oil and Gas partners with major operators to utilize the latest in drilling technology to reduce dry hole risks and increase the likelihood of drilling productive wells. Many of Reef’s wells today utilize horizontal drilling technology and are currently being drilled with 12-38 fracture stages. Hydraulic fracturing uses a liquid mix of water and sand and is injected into the rock at a high pressure, creating fractures in the rock that allow the oil and natural gas to flow freely to the surface. According to the EIA, U.S. oil production is expected to increase 20% because of multi-stage fracturing technology.

Atlas Resources LLC, a subsidiary of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based energy group, aims to raise as much as $300 million before the offer closes Dec. 31. The company says it will toss in up to $145 million of its own capital, too. But not all investors are created equal in this undertaking. Atlas’s confidential offering memorandum, reviewed by Reuters, shows why. Up to $45 million of the money raised will be paid to Atlas affiliate Anthem Securities to cover commissions to broker-dealers who market the deal, the memorandum says. As much as $39 million more will be used to buy drilling leases from another affiliate. Atlas-affiliated suppliers may also get some of the $53 million set aside for buying drilling and transport equipment. An additional $8 million of Atlas’s investment is not an investment at all; it is a 15 percent markup on estimated equipment costs. As soon as drilling begins, Atlas will pay itself nearly $52 million in various other fees and markups. In short, Atlas’s $145 million exposure is reduced by at least 40%, and possibly much more, after taking into account payments to group affiliates and markups. Further, if and when the venture starts generating revenue, Atlas is entitled to a 33 percent cut, reflecting the size of its stake before accounting for those payments and markups. Atlas is raising money for the venture, called Atlas Resources Series 34-2014 LP, in what is known as a private placement - a sale of unregistered securities through broker-dealers to a limited number of investors. And as the offering details suggest, oil and gas private placements tend to be structured so that “the house always wins,” said Mitch Little, a Frisco, Texas-based lawyer who has represented investors in and issuers of private placements. Quick and Easy Private placements, a lightly regulated market comprising hundreds of billions of dollars a year in new issues, have a long history in the oil and gas sector. Small prospectors, known as “wildcatters,” have for years used them as a quick, easy way to fund the expensive and highly speculative process of drilling, drawing in investors keen to take advantage of generous federal tax breaks on energy exploration. In the new century, the U.S. “fracking” boom has prompted a new wave of prospecting, attracting tens of thousands of investors. Reuters was able to review offering memoranda and other marketing material for six oil and gas private placements issued over the past 15 years by four companies: Atlas; Reef Oil & Gas Partners of Richardson, Texas; Discovery Resources & Development LLC of Frisco, Texas; and Black Diamond Energy Inc of Buffalo, Wyoming. These documents contain details on multiple previous private placements by each company, and they show that the deal Atlas is now marketing adheres to a common template: The issuers typically charged between 15 percent and 20 percent in upfront fees from investors, while paying brokers – often affiliated with the issuer - an additional 10 percent of the total offering in sales commissions. The upshot is that the issuer often starts out at an advantage relative to outside investors. For slightly more than half of 43 private placements Atlas issued over the past three decades, outside investors lost money or just about broke even. In 29 of those deals, Atlas did better than those investors. Of 34 deals Reef has issued since 1996, only 12 have paid out more cash to investors than they initially contributed, according to Reef's latest publicly available financial statements. The statements show Reef sold an additional 31 smaller deals between 1996 and 2010 for which it collected a total of $146 million and paid out just $55 million. Brian Begley, Atlas Energy’s vice president for investor relations, declined to comment. Reef Chief Executive Officer Michael Mauceli said in a statement: “We have conducted our business with the utmost integrity, meeting and surpassing ethical, business and regulatory standards.” Energy ventures are by their nature risky prospects, narrow bets on a single commodity. Wells can come up dry. Volatility in oil and gas prices can sink returns. As Atlas warns in the memorandum for its offering: “These securities are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. You should purchase these securities only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment.” Unpaid for Risks Beyond the inherent risks, though, these deals are often unfair to outside investors, said David Miller, a Houston-based lawyer who represents investors in lawsuits against issuers and brokers of private placements. "Investors are taking on huge risks, but simply are not getting paid for those risks,” he said. Issuers say that criticism ignores the tax benefits of their deals. Investors can write off more than 90 percent of their initial outlay the year they make it. But investors in oil and gas deals comprise not just the savvy, high-income individuals meant to use the tax break. Of the 28 people interviewed for this article who invested in deals from Reef, Atlas, Discovery Resources and Black Diamond over the past 10 years, 17 were retirees who had low tax burdens when they signed on. Under U.S. law, brokers can market private placements only to institutions and accredited investors, the latter defined as American residents with either $1 million in assets, not including the investor's primary residence, or $250,000 in annual income. Those criteria were set in 1982. Since then, inflation has greatly expanded the number of people who qualify. Now, they include people like Arla Funk, a 79-year-old retiree who works part-time for the Salt Lake City, Utah, school system in a job that pays $10 an hour. In 2006, Funk invested $100,000 in a private placement called Atlas American Series 27-2006. “We were looking for some long-term retirement kind of income," Funk said. She said the broker who sold her on the deal told her she would receive “a paycheck that comes every month.” As of Dec. 31, 2013 - seven years after she gave Atlas her money - she and other outside investors had earned back just 31 percent of their principal. For her and other unhappy investors in private placements, selling isn’t a realistic option: There is no active secondary market for the securities. “When I finally found out what a scam it was, I was upset because it was too late for me to do anything,” Funk said. In addition to the Atlas and Reef deals reviewed for this article, thirteen from Black Diamond between 2001 and 2006 failed to generate enough revenue to return investors’ initial contribution. Black Diamond filed for bankruptcy in 2011 after a major bank creditor called its loans. It never completed the bankruptcy process. Its principals, one of whom, Charles Koval, was a founder of Atlas Energy, are trying to sell Black Diamond’s leases and equipment. Koval declined to comment. Discovery Resources, which issued four private placements between 2006 and 2009, filed for bankruptcy in 2010, as did its founder Richard Weyand. Federal prosecutors in March charged Weyand with filing a false tax return for 2008 to hide $101,000. He pleaded guilty in April and is currently awaiting sentencing. Weyand’s lawyer, Jeff Boggess, said Discovery Resources' deals provided tax breaks to investors and therefore could not be called unsuccessful. Large and Opaque All sorts of businesses – including banks, heavy industry and, especially, investment pools like hedge funds and private equity firms - use private placements to raise money for all sorts of purposes. The market is vast: A Reuters analysis of nearly 100,000 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission found that between 2008 and the second quarter of this year, issuers intended to raise as much as $5.5 trillion through private placements. And that sum excludes the 22,000 issues intended to raise “indefinite” sums. (The number of issuers does not include those who submitted paper, rather than electronic, filings before 2009.) The market is also opaque. The required documents filed with the SEC typically state the name of the issuer, the maximum amount sought, and little more. There are no follow-up filing requirements. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the securities industry’s self-regulatory body, requires that brokers perform due diligence on each issue they sell to ensure its suitability for investors. But as Reuters reported in a previous article, many brokers rely on outside due-diligence firms that are in fact paid by the issuers - a setup under which some issuers have engaged in multimillion- and even multibillion-dollar frauds.   Retired engineer Bill Jenkins looks over documents concerning his investment in Reef's Income & Development Fund II at his home in Orlando, Florida, October 31, 2014.Steve NesiusIn the oil and gas sector, the SEC data show that since 2008, nearly 4,000 private placements have sought to raise as much as $122 billion. Brad Bennett, head of enforcement at FINRA, said in a statement that brokers need to be “meticulous in their consideration of the types of customers for whom [oil and gas private placements] may be suitable.” He added that the deals should be “only recommended to clients whose financial goals are consistent with the products and who understand the risks inherent in them.” State and federal regulators have little scope for oversight of private placements, and the scant reporting requirements give them little information to work with. In a 2013 alert to the public, the SEC said investors needed to keep in mind that oil and gas private placements were especially risky, that they often carried hidden fees, and that issuers routinely made money even when drilling yielded no oil or gas. A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.  Issuers stay on the right side of securities laws through voluminous disclosures in their offering documents, which brokers are required to provide to investors. Fred Rosenberg, a former investment broker who analyzes oil and gas private placements for parties in legal disputes, reviewed the offering memorandum for Atlas's latest deal at Reuters's request. He said the 407-page document made the risks of the investment clear. “This looks, on my first reading, to be a legitimate offering," he said. Among other things, the document says investors might never get their money back, and it warned investors that there could be conflicts of interest between them and Atlas, and that the conflicts might not be resolved in their favor. However, Rosenberg said: “If the investor expects a profitable return and income stream over his lifetime ... think otherwise.” Hard Sell In the past decade, investors have been drawn to oil and gas placements as a way to profit from the revolution in drilling technologies that have opened up huge stores of oil and gas in previously inaccessible locations. One of them was Bill Jenkins. In early 2007, the retired engineer, now 77 years old, attended the Money Show, a convention held in several locations every year that brings together investors and providers of money-making opportunities.   At Reef’s booth, he picked up a printed breakdown of some older Reef deals. Over six to eight years, the flier said, an initial outlay of $100,000 would have paid back, depending on the deal, between $176,160 and $231,310. Retired engineer Bill Jenkins looks over documents concerning his investment in Reef's Income & Development Fund II at his home in Orlando, Florida, October 31, 2014.Steve NesiusJenkins then got a call from Richard Main, who worked for Reef's affiliated securities broker. Jenkins said Main told him that Reef's Income & Development Fund II required a minimum investment of $100,000 – more than Jenkins and his wife had available – but that he could get them in for just $25,000. Main told them they had to hurry, though, because the deal was just about to close, Jenkins said. The couple went for it. Main told them to expect some paperwork. “ ‘You’re not going to understand it, but don’t worry, I’ll walk you through it,' " Jenkins said the broker told him. Jenkins received a 52-page offering memorandum, marketing materials and other documents, and a postage-paid return envelope. He said Main told him: “As soon as you get the package, call me because I need to get this thing back.” On the phone, Jenkins followed along as Main guided him to pages where he had to sign. When they were done, Jenkins said, Main told him: “ ‘Now if you can’t get this in the mail today, give me a call and let me know so I can maybe work with my boss and get you into it.’ ” After the couple sent the package back to Main, “He called back and said, ‘Yeah, you guys did good, you made it,’ ” Jenkins said. Soon, the couple began receiving monthly checks ranging from $150 to $300. Though the offering documents fully disclosed the risks of the venture, Jenkins said he didn’t realize until much later that he and his wife had signed dozens of pages of paperwork attesting to their understanding of the deal and their willingness to accept the possibility of losing all of their investment.  If he had looked more closely at the time, Jenkins would have found that the offering memorandum clearly stated that the minimum investment was $25,000. It also contained a long section about the risks of the investment, such as conflicts of interest among Reef’s various entities. Under the terms, investors would turn over $50 million to Reef, and right away Reef would keep $7.5 million for fees and broker commissions. After that, Reef would receive a monthly management fee of $41,667 from the fund. Reef would also charge drilling and operating, legal and other expenses to the fund. The amounts of these expenses would be determined by other Reef entities hired to do work for the venture. No more than half of the money would be used to buy oil and gas properties in areas where there were proved reserves. Once the properties started producing revenue, Reef would determine how much would be available for distribution. Main declined to comment. His lawyer, John R. Fahy, disputed much of Jenkins’s account. He said Main never told Jenkins the minimum investment was $100,000 and didn’t rush Jenkins through the process. Dwindling Returns In November 2007, as the checks from the $25,000 investment were rolling in, Jenkins received another call from Main. He was now touting Reef Income & Development Fund III. The couple put in another $25,000. This time, they got some relatives in on the deal. When checks from Fund II started to dwindle, they didn’t worry. Reef newsletters reassured them that volatility was normal. But then the size of the checks from Fund III began to shrink. Soon they were arriving only every three months. Jenkins said a friend and fellow Reef investor noticed that separate monthly statements from the two funds were identical; money from both had gone into the same wells. "We called them and they said, 'Oh, we forgot to plug in the numbers for III,' " Jenkins said. Jenkins and his fellow investors asked for their money back in 2011, but Reef declined. Under terms of the deal, Reef is not required to buy back the shares. In 2012, Jenkins, along with friends and relatives who had invested with him, filed an arbitration claim with FINRA against Reef Securities, claiming Reef had defrauded them by misrepresenting the two deals. The investor group sought nearly $2 million in compensatory and punitive damages. FINRA arbitrators ruled on July 14 that Reef Securities was “liable on the claim of negligent failure to supervise” and that Reef should return $188,000, or slightly more than half of the investors’ money. It did not provide a public explanation for the basis of its decision. Reef CEO Mauceli noted that the amount was far less than what the group of investors was seeking and that it did not include punitive damages. The panel awarded the Jenkinses $32,500. The couple’s lawyer, Daxton White, will get 40 percent of the total award to investors. He said he doesn’t expect the decision will alter Reef’s way of doing business. "As long as they can sell it, they'll keep doing it, because they make money regardless of the deal's outcome," he said. Reef has gotten back 48 percent of the capital it put into Reef Income and Development Fund II and 61 percent of what it put into Reef Income and Development Fund III, while investors have gotten just 16 percent and 4 percent of their capital back on those deals, respectively. Mauceli said the “disproportionate returns” reflect Reef’s “carried interest” as general partner in the deals, “which is a long-standing and well-respected standard in the oil and gas industry.” He stressed that the differences also did not take into account tax benefits investors may have enjoyed. “The investments we offer are highly speculative opportunities designed for sophisticated, accredited investors, such as Mr. Jenkins,” he said. Main left Reef in 2008. FINRA suspended his broker's license in 2010 after he failed to respond to the regulator's request for information, records show. He is now one of two principals at an oil and gas investment business, FIG Tree Capital Ventures, his lawyer said. Reef’s two most recent private placements are showing early promising results – mostly for Reef. The company has earned back 182 percent on a 2011 deal; outside investors are still in the hole, having earned just 21 percent of their outlay. And for a 2012 deal, the company has already recouped nearly 20 percent of its capital; other investors have gotten 3 percent of theirs. Additional reporting by Selam Gebrekidan.

1.
Organization and Basis of Presentation

 

The
condensed financial statements of Reef Oil & Gas Income
and Development Fund III, L.P. (the “Partnership”) have
been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain
information and footnote disclosure normally included in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations.
We have recorded all transactions and adjustments necessary to
fairly present the financial statements included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”). The
adjustments are normal and recurring. The following notes describe
only the material changes in accounting policies, account details,
or financial statement notes during the first six months of 2011.
Therefore, please read these condensed financial statements and
notes to condensed financial statements together with the audited
financial statements and notes to financial statements contained in
the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the

Partnership follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and
gas properties. Under this method, all direct costs and certain
indirect costs associated with acquisition of properties and
successful as well as unsuccessful exploration and development
activities are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion, and
amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties and estimated
future development costs, excluding unproved properties, are based
on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved reserves,
as determined by independent petroleum engineers.  For
these purposes, proved natural gas reserves are converted to
equivalent barrels of crude oil at a rate of 6 Mcf to 1
Bbl.

 

In
applying the full cost method, the Partnership performs a quarterly
ceiling test on the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties,
whereby the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are limited
to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved
reserves using prices that are the 12-month un-weighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for crude oil and
natural gas held constant and discounted at 10%, plus the lower of
cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties, if any. If
capitalized costs exceed the ceiling, an impairment loss is
recognized for the amount by which the capitalized costs exceed the
ceiling, and is shown as a reduction of oil and gas properties and
as property impairment expense on the Partnership’s
statements of operations. No gain or loss is recognized upon sale
or disposition of oil and gas properties, unless such a sale would
significantly alter the rate of depletion and amortization. During
the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011, the
Partnership recognized no property impairment expense of proved
properties. During the three and six month periods ended
June 30, 2010, the Partnership recognized property impairment
expense of proved properties totaling $2,072,207 and $3,524,682,
respectively.

 

During the
fourth quarter of 2010, the Partnership fully impaired its unproved
properties associated with the Slaughter Dean project by
recognizing $53,166,873 of property impairment expense. At
December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011, unproved properties
consist of non-operated, undrilled infill and offset drilling
locations associated with certain working interests acquired from
Azalea Properties Ltd. on January 19, 2010 by RCWI L.P., an
affiliate of Reef, and assigned to the Partnership (the
“Azalea Acquired Properties”). Unproved properties are
assessed for impairment quarterly as of the balance sheet date by
considering drilling activity in the area of the unproved
properties and other information.  Any impairment resulting
from this quarterly assessment is reported as property impairment
expense in the current period, as appropriate. During the three and
six month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, the
Partnership recognized no impairment of unproved
properties.

 

Estimates
of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

 

Estimates
of the Partnership’s proved reserves at June 30, 2011
and December 31, 2010 have been prepared and presented in
accordance with SEC rules and accounting standards which
require SEC reporting entities to prepare their reserve estimates
using pricing based upon the un-weighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month

commodity
prices over the preceding 12-month period and current costs. Future
prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than these
prices and costs, which would impact the estimate of reserves and
future cash flows.

 

Reserves
and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the
Partnership’s depletion and impairment calculations. As a
result, adjustments to depletion and impairment are made
concurrently with changes to reserve estimates. If proved reserve
estimates decline, the rate at which depletion expense is recorded
increases, reducing net income. A decline in estimated proved
reserves and future cash flows also reduces the capitalized cost
ceiling and may result in increased impairment expense.

 

Restoration,
Removal, and Environmental Liabilities

 

The
Partnership is subject to extensive Federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. These laws regulate the
discharge of materials into the environment and may require the
Partnership to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the
disposal or release of petroleum substances at various sites.
Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on
their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations and that have no
future economic benefit are expensed.

 

Liabilities
for expenditures of a non-capital nature are recorded when
environmental assessments and/or remediation is probable, and the
costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are generally
undiscounted values unless the timing of cash payments for the
liability or component is fixed or reliably
determinable.

 

Asset
retirement costs and liabilities associated with future site
restoration and abandonment of long-lived assets are initially
measured at fair value, which approximates the cost a third party
would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire such
assets. The fair value is recognized in the financial statements as
the present value of expected future cash expenditures for site
restoration and abandonment. Subsequent to the initial measurement,
the effect of the passage of time on the liability for the net
asset retirement obligation (accretion expense) and the
amortization of the asset retirement cost are recognized in the
results of operations.

 

The
following table summarizes the Partnership’s asset retirement
obligation for the six month period ended June 30, 2011 and
the year ended December 31, 2010.

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

The
estimated fair values for financial instruments have been
determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market
information. These estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be
determined with precision. The estimated fair value of cash,
accounts receivable, accounts receivable from affiliates, and
accounts payable approximates their carrying value due to their
short-term nature. The fair market value of the
Partnership’s long-term debt approximates the carrying value
at June 30, 2011 as it yields interest at rates currently
available in the market.

Long-Term Debt

 

On
June 30, 2010, the Partnership and Texas Capital Bank, N.A.
(“TCB”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the
“Credit Agreement”) with a $5,000,000 borrowing base,
and a related promissory note and security agreement for purposes
of funding the acquisition of oil and gas properties purchased from
Lett Oil & Gas, L.P. (“Lett”) by RCWI LP,
(“RCWI”) a Reef affiliate, and assigned to the
Partnership under the Assignment, Conveyance and Bill of Sale
described in Note 2 of the Annual Report (the “Lett Acquired
Properties”).  The per annum interest rate is equal to
the U.S. prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal’s
“Monday Rates” plus 0.5%, with a minimum interest rate
of 5%, payable monthly.  The obligations of TCB to the
Partnership under the Credit Agreement expire on June

Table of Contents

 

30, 2013,
at which point the promissory note matures, and any unpaid
principal and interest becomes due and payable.  The Credit
Agreement is a reducing revolving credit facility, and is subject
to semi-annual redetermination of the borrowing base in accordance
with the TCB’s customary practices for oil and gas
loans.  At June 30, 2010, the borrowing base was equal to
$5,000,000.  The Partnership borrowed $5,000,000 from TCB
under the Credit Agreement which was paid directly to Lett to
satisfy the closing obligations of RCWI under the Lett Purchase
Agreement as described in Note 2 of the Annual Report.  The
principal and accrued interest thereon may generally be prepaid by
the Partnership in whole or in part at any time and without premium
or penalty.

 

Under the
terms of the Credit Agreement, on June 30, 2010 the
Partnership paid TCB a facility fee of $50,000 (one percent (1.00%)
of the initial borrowing base) and is obligated to further pay,
upon each determination of an increase in the borrowing base, a
facility fee in the amount of one percent (1.00%) of the amount by
which the borrowing base is increased over that in effect on the
date of determination.  On June 30, 2010, the Partnership
also paid TCB an engineering fee in the amount of $5,000, and is
obligated to further pay additional engineering fees in the amount
of $5,000 if TCB’s internal engineers perform the engineering
review of the collateral; or the actual fees and expenses of any
third-party engineers retained by TCB to prepare an engineering
report, payable at the time of a redetermination of the borrowing
base.

 

The Credit
Agreement is guaranteed by RCWI and RCWI GP LLC, both affiliates of
Reef. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first
priority lien on no less than 90% of the oil and gas properties
utilized in determining the borrowing base, based on the net
present value of the crude oil and natural gas to be produced from
the oil and gas properties calculated using a discount rate of nine
percent (9.00%) per annum.

 

On
May 20, 2011, the Partnership entered into the First Amendment
to Credit Agreement (“Amendment”) with TCB. Under the
Amendment, the borrowing base was reduced to $4,100,000 effective
May 20, 2011.  In addition, effective June 1, 2011,
the borrowing base is reduced by $55,000 per month.  On
May 24, 2011, the Partnership paid TCB fees of $43,500 in
connection with the Amendment.  These fees have been
capitalized as other non-current assets on the accompanying balance
sheet and will be amortized over the term of the credit
agreement.

 

The Credit
Agreement contains various covenants, including among
others:

 


·
                 
restrictions
on liens;

 

·
                 
restrictions
on incurring other indebtedness without the lenders’
consent;

 

·
                 
restrictions
on distributions and other restricted payments;

 

·
                 
maintenance
of a current ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter commencing
September 30, 2010 of not less than 1.0 to 1.0, as adjusted;
and

 

·
                 
maintenance
of an interest coverage ratio of cash flow to fixed charges as of
the end of each fiscal quarter commencing September 30, 2010,
to be at least 3.0 to 1.0.

 

All
outstanding amounts owed under the Credit Agreement become due and
payable upon the occurrence of certain usual and customary events
of default, including among others:

 

·
                 
failure to
make payments under the Credit Agreement;

 

·
                 
non-performance
of covenants and obligations continuing beyond any applicable grace
period; and

 

·
                 
the
occurrence of a “Change in Control” (as defined in the
Credit Agreement).

 

At
June 30, 2011, the Partnership was in compliance with the
financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.

Transactions with Affiliates

 

Reef
Exploration, L.P. (“RELP”), an affiliate of Reef
Oil & Gas Partners, L.P. (“Reef”), the
managing general partner of the Partnership, currently serves as
the operator of a working interest in a producing oil property
located in the Slaughter Field in Cochran County, Texas (“the
Slaughter Dean Project”) and receives drilling compensation
in an amount equal to 15% of the total well costs paid by the
Partnership.  RELP also receives drilling compensation in
an amount equal to 5% of the total well costs paid by the
Partnership for non-operated wells included in the Azalea Acquired
Properties and the Lett Acquired Properties. All of the wells
included in these two purchases are non-operated. Total well costs
include all drilling and equipment costs, including intangible
development costs, surface facilities, and costs of pipelines
necessary to connect the well to the nearest delivery
point.  In addition, total well costs also include the
costs of all developmental activities on a well, such as reworking,
working over, deepening, sidetracking, fracturing a producing well,
installing pipeline for a well or any other activity incident to
the operations of a well, excluding ordinary well operating costs
after completion.  Total well costs do not include costs
relating to lease acquisitions.  During the six month
period ended June 30, 2011, RELP received $19,990 in drilling
compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2010, RELP
received $232,775 in drilling compensation.  Drilling
compensation payments are included in oil and gas properties in the
financial statements.

 

Additionally,
Reef and its affiliates are reimbursed for direct costs and all
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the
Partnership. During the three and six month periods ended
June 30, 2011, Reef and its affiliates received total
reimbursements for direct costs of $90,489 and $202,078,
respectively, and other documented out-of-pocket expenses of $414
and $729, respectively. During the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2010, Reef and its affiliates received total
reimbursements for direct costs of $125,263 and $218,156,
respectively, and other documented out-of-pocket expenses of $2,173
and $6,702, respectively.

 

RELP
receives an administrative fee to cover all general and
administrative costs in an amount equal to 1/12 th
 of
1% of all capital raised payable monthly.  During the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, RELP
received $224,220 and $448,440, respectively, in administrative
fees. Administrative fees are included in general and
administrative expense in the financial statements. RELP’s
general and administrative costs include all customary and routine
expenses, accounting, office rent, telephone, secretarial, salaries
and other incidental expenses incurred by RELP or its affiliates
that are necessary to the conduct of the Partnership’s
business, whether generated by RELP, its affiliates or by third
parties, but excluding direct costs and operating costs.

 

RELP
processes joint interest billings and revenues on behalf of the
Partnership. At June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, RELP
owed the Partnership $84,246 and $45,640, respectively, for net
revenues processed in excess of joint interest and technical and
administrative services charges. The cash associated with net
revenues processed by RELP is normally received by RELP from oil
and gas purchasers 30-60 days after the end of the month to which
the revenues pertain.

 

In
December 2010, the Partnership sold its interests in certain
oil and gas properties in the Lusk Field in Lea County, New Mexico,
to Reef 2010 Drilling Fund, L.P., a Reef affiliate. These interests
were sold primarily due to the planned or actual drilling of
exploratory wells on the acreage involved.  In accordance with
its stated objectives, the Partnership will not participate in
exploratory drilling activities.  The sale included the
Partnership’s interests in five existing wells, as well as
the undeveloped acreage upon which an exploratory well is intended
to be drilled.  The Partnership accepted a sales price of
$59,455 in exchange for these interests, of which the entire amount
was included in accounts receivable from affiliates on the balance
sheet as of December 31, 2010.  The Partnership received
the entire sales price of $59,455 in cash during the first quarter
of 2011.

 

In
January 2011, the Partnership sold a portion of its interests
in the Thums Long Beach Unit to Reef Oil & Gas 2010-A
Income Fund, L.P., a Reef affiliate.  The Thums Long Beach
Unit is a long-lived waterflood project in the Wilmington Field,
located underneath the Long Beach Harbor in southern California.
The Partnership received $350,000 in cash in exchange for these
interests.  In June 2011, the Partnership sold an
additional portion of its interests in the Thums Long Beach Unit to
Reef Oil & Gas 2010-A Income Fund, L.P.  The
Partnership received $2,650,000 in cash in exchange for these
additional interests.  These sales transactions reduced the
full cost pool of capitalized oil and gas properties.

Overview

 

Reef
Oil & Gas Income and Development Fund III, L.P. is a Texas
limited partnership. The primary objectives of the Partnership are
to purchase working interests in oil and gas properties with the
purposes of (i) growing the value of properties through the
development of proved undeveloped reserves, (ii) generating
revenue from the production of crude oil and natural gas,
(iii) distributing cash to the partners of the Partnership,
and (iv) selling the properties no later than 2015, in order
to maximize return to the partners of the
Partnership.  Reef is the managing general partner of the
Partnership.

 

On
properties purchased by the Partnership, the Partnership plans to
produce existing proved reserves and develop any proved undeveloped
reserves, but does not expect to engage in exploratory drilling for
unproved reserves, should acreage purchased by the Partnership be
deemed to contain unproved drilling locations.  Drilling
locations for unproved reserves, if any, may be farmed out or sold
to third parties or other partnerships formed by Reef.

 

The
Partnership purchased an initial 41% working interest in a
producing oil property located in the Slaughter Field in Cochran
County, Texas, approximately 50 miles southwest of Lubbock, Texas
(the “Slaughter Dean Project”), in January 2008
from Sierra-Dean Production Company, L.P. (“Sierra
Dean”).   Under the terms of the acquisition
agreement, each month thereafter additional working interests are
purchased based on the amount the Partnership spends developing the
project through January 2013.  Under the acquisition
agreement the Partnership generally pays 82% of all drilling,
development and repair costs (including amounts allocable to the
working interest initially retained by Sierra Dean), and Sierra
Dean conveys additional working interests to the Partnership each
month in payment of its share of such costs. In a separate
transaction in May 2008, the Partnership purchased 11% of the
18% working interest in the Slaughter Dean Project owned by Davric
Corporation (“Davric”).

 

The
management of the operations and other business of the Partnership
is the responsibility of Reef.  Reef Exploration, L.P.
(“RELP”), an affiliate of Reef, serves as the operator
of the Slaughter Dean Project. This relationship with the
Partnership is governed by two operating agreements.  One
operating agreement (the “Sierra-Dean Operating
Agreement” is between the Partnership, RELP and Sierra
Dean.  The other operating agreement is between the
Partnership, RELP, and Davric (the “Davric Operating
Agreement”).

 

The
Partnership was advised during the second quarter of 2010 that
Davric, who is unrelated to Reef and owns a 7% working interest in
the Dean Unit and the Dean “B” unit, was unable to pay
$538,443 of its share of costs incurred subsequent to
February 28, 2009.  Pursuant to the Davric Operating
Agreement, the Partnership assumed the 7% working interest of
Davric and Davric is now a non-consenting working interest owner.
The unpaid costs were recorded as property additions and operating
costs on the books of the Partnership during the second quarter
of

2010, and
the Partnership will retain the assumed Davric 7% working interest
until the net revenues related to this interest exceed the unpaid
costs, plus penalties ranging from 300% to 450% of the amount in
default.

 

On
January 19, 2010, RCWI, an affiliate of the Partnership,
completed the acquisition of certain working interests in oil and
gas properties from Azalea Properties Ltd. for a purchase price of
$21,610,116 pursuant to the Azalea Purchase
Agreement.  The Azalea Purchase Agreement was subject to
three Side Letter Agreements regarding the post-closing acquisition
of proven undeveloped properties, the post-closing resolution of
properties with title defects, and the post-closing resolution of
third-party consents for certain properties.

 

Subsequently,
RCWI entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with the
Partnership, dated January 19, 2010, to sell portions of the
working interests acquired from Azalea Properties Ltd. to the
Partnership.  The Partnership acquired 61% of the working
interests initially acquired by RCWI from Azalea Properties Ltd.
for a purchase price of $13,182,171 in cash subject to post-closing
adjustments.  RCWI also assigned portions of the acquired
working interests to other affiliates of RCWI and the Partnership
on the same terms. The Azalea Acquired Properties cover more than
400 properties, including more than 1,400 wells, located in Texas,
California, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota,
Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas, Montana, Colorado, and Arkansas, and
include undrilled infill and offset locations.  The
acquired working interests represent minority non-operated
