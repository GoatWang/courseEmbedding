My New Role

By Lew Moorman -  July 25, 2013 





I sent the following email to Rackers this morning:
Hey Rackers,
I have not given you an update on my personal situation since early March. I do have some news to share that impacts my life at Rackspace.
My wife had successful surgery on her cancer in late March. We remain hopeful for her future, but there are real uncertainties and challenges ahead. This has been a life changing experience for our family and coincides with some difficult, ongoing health issues we face with our oldest daughter. Given these circumstances, I have taken some time to assess my ability to balance the demands of leading the Rack with the needs of my family.
The job of president for a company of this size and speed is a 24×7 endeavor. Like many of you, when I am not here, my mind is still mainly focused on our work. I’ve found it a very rewarding trade because I get to build something special here with all of you. But, this is not a pace I can keep up in my current circumstances. And, you deserve full commitment from your leaders.
Therefore, over the next few months I will hand off of my day-to-day responsibilities to other members of our senior leadership team. At that time, I will step down as president and chief strategy officer and assume a much more limited role.
I am not leaving Rackspace. I will remain involved as a member of our board of directors, as a committed shareholder, and as a part-time employee advising the company, primarily on strategy and product direction. Our industry is in a time of transition, which offers big challenges and opportunities, and I am as excited as ever about our future. I believe that the rise of OpenStack, the appeal of a true hybrid cloud, and the value and power of Fanatical Support will drive us to a great position in the market. I am excited to watch the company’s progress, evangelize for it, and help in any way I can.
During the next few months of my transition, I will remain 100% committed and focused on putting our leadership team in a position to win. Taylor Rhodes’s transition to chief customer officer, leading the sales and support segments, is a great step. A few weeks ago, we added a new CMO in Rick Jackson to lead our marketing efforts. I will continue to help with his integration, but as of now, he will report to Lanham. In terms of strategy, product and corporate development, I will continue to lead these groups full-time during the transition. I am working with the relevant senior leaders (Jim Curry, Mark Interrante and Pat Matthews) on how best to structure these interrelated activities long term. We have some strong approaches emerging.  In addition, I believe this will be the set of activities in which I will stay most involved as an advisor.
I cannot tell you how much the support from all of you has meant to me over the 13 years I’ve worked here, and especially during my family’s health issues. You truly are my friends and family. I will not reminisce on my time here because this is not goodbye – I am still a Racker! I am open to discussing this change with you. Please reach out to me. I will do my best to meet with anyone and everyone who has concerns and questions. The Rack is a huge part of my life and this change comes with very mixed emotions for me. But, I am confident it is right for me, my family – and the Rack. Our best days are still ahead. Let’s keep after it.
Thank you,
Lew

What a year!  OpenStack at One

By Lew Moorman -  July 19, 2011 





It is truly amazing that it has just been one year since we at Rackspace, along with NASA and 25 other organizations, officially announced the launch of OpenStack.  From day one we have been shocked by the interest, engagement and momentum of the community launched to build the de facto open standard cloud operating system.  Turns out the world was craving a truly open project devoted to cloud software, and they quickly got behind OpenStack.
The stats are just amazing:
-Developer summits:  #1 – 100 attendees; #2 – 250 attendees; #3 – 500 attendees
-Number of contributors who have signed CLA:  217
-Number of developer community members: 1,200
-Number of downloads from Launchpad alone:  35,000
It was only with the Cactus release in April that OpenStack Compute (Nova) became a production-ready platform for most enterprises. The number of companies — from large service providers across the globe to major Fortune 500 companies — that are currently either deploying or experimenting will soon result in a huge spike in that number.
About 18 months ago, Rackspace decided definitively it would give away the intellectual property that built its cloud and embrace open source.  Our strategy rests on a few simple ideas:  1) standards matter and the cloud really needed an open, strong de-facto approach; 2) the core technology that runs datacenters should innovate faster and be available to all, 3) in working with a great ecosystem of partners we could get access to better technology than we could on our own.  We have no regrets about the approach.  Yes, we have and will continue to enable many competitors.  True, many companies will hold on to computing since they now have the tools they need to run it closer to the efficiency at which a cloud provider can, but this was always part of the bargain.  Our job is to create a better experience, to operate our cloud better, to deliver scale and to offer an unparalleled level of service we call Fanatical Support™.  In the end, the tech won’t win, the experience will.  At least, that’s how we see it.
What will the next year hold?  Here are just three of my predictions:
1.  Mature code that is ready to deploy. OpenStack is a young project: the code is young and the ease of deployment is still too low; however, this is rapidly changing.  Not only is the code getting ready for major production systems, deploying and operating OpenStack clouds will soon become easier.  Furthermore, the number of features and capabilities will grow exponentially, whether in core projects or in new projects emerging in networking, identity management and web-based interfaces.
2.  Big time deployments, including Rackspace.  The number of big name companies relying on OpenStack is going to shock people in the coming year.  We are 100 percent committed to the OpenStack code base.  In the coming months, we will make several announcements regarding our plans and it’s our understanding we are not alone.
3.  The OpenStack economy.  Startups, M&A and new products are already emerging to tap into the OpenStack installed base.  It will multiply.  If you build enterprise hardware and software but not thinking about how you fit in the OpenStack community you are missing a huge opportunity.  As the network grows, its value will multiple.  Interoperability standards will need to emerge and we hope to help make it happen.
Together, we will see how it turns out.  As the project turns one, we thank all those community members that have made it all possible.  No question many organizations and companies have made huge contributions to this effort.  NASA, Citrix, Dell, Cisco, NTT and Nicira are just a few of the major contributors, and we thank them.  Thanks to all for a great year.
Now the fun begins…

Cloud Insights

What a year!  OpenStack at One

By Lew Moorman -  July 19, 2011 





It is truly amazing that it has just been one year since we at Rackspace, along with NASA and 25 other organizations, officially announced the launch of OpenStack.  From day one we have been shocked by the interest, engagement and momentum of the community launched to build the de facto open standard cloud operating system.  Turns out the world was craving a truly open project devoted to cloud software, and they quickly got behind OpenStack.
The stats are just amazing:
-Developer summits:  #1 – 100 attendees; #2 – 250 attendees; #3 – 500 attendees
-Number of contributors who have signed CLA:  217
-Number of developer community members: 1,200
-Number of downloads from Launchpad alone:  35,000
It was only with the Cactus release in April that OpenStack Compute (Nova) became a production-ready platform for most enterprises. The number of companies — from large service providers across the globe to major Fortune 500 companies — that are currently either deploying or experimenting will soon result in a huge spike in that number.
About 18 months ago, Rackspace decided definitively it would give away the intellectual property that built its cloud and embrace open source.  Our strategy rests on a few simple ideas:  1) standards matter and the cloud really needed an open, strong de-facto approach; 2) the core technology that runs datacenters should innovate faster and be available to all, 3) in working with a great ecosystem of partners we could get access to better technology than we could on our own.  We have no regrets about the approach.  Yes, we have and will continue to enable many competitors.  True, many companies will hold on to computing since they now have the tools they need to run it closer to the efficiency at which a cloud provider can, but this was always part of the bargain.  Our job is to create a better experience, to operate our cloud better, to deliver scale and to offer an unparalleled level of service we call Fanatical Support™.  In the end, the tech won’t win, the experience will.  At least, that’s how we see it.
What will the next year hold?  Here are just three of my predictions:
1.  Mature code that is ready to deploy. OpenStack is a young project: the code is young and the ease of deployment is still too low; however, this is rapidly changing.  Not only is the code getting ready for major production systems, deploying and operating OpenStack clouds will soon become easier.  Furthermore, the number of features and capabilities will grow exponentially, whether in core projects or in new projects emerging in networking, identity management and web-based interfaces.
2.  Big time deployments, including Rackspace.  The number of big name companies relying on OpenStack is going to shock people in the coming year.  We are 100 percent committed to the OpenStack code base.  In the coming months, we will make several announcements regarding our plans and it’s our understanding we are not alone.
3.  The OpenStack economy.  Startups, M&A and new products are already emerging to tap into the OpenStack installed base.  It will multiply.  If you build enterprise hardware and software but not thinking about how you fit in the OpenStack community you are missing a huge opportunity.  As the network grows, its value will multiple.  Interoperability standards will need to emerge and we hope to help make it happen.
Together, we will see how it turns out.  As the project turns one, we thank all those community members that have made it all possible.  No question many organizations and companies have made huge contributions to this effort.  NASA, Citrix, Dell, Cisco, NTT and Nicira are just a few of the major contributors, and we thank them.  Thanks to all for a great year.
Now the fun begins…

            There's a myth that clouds just run themselves. While clouds let us do more with less - and give us much, much more the moment we need it - cloud computing presents new challenges to operations teams.Instead of racking and stacking servers, you're clicking and dragging virtual machines. Operational chops are more important than ever now that platforms can grow and shrink within minutes.

Working in the cloud requires a similar shift in the paradigm. What will the future role of IT be in this shift?  Sponsored by Rackspace.

Lew Moorman: Open Cloud Key to Modern Networking



Rackspace President Lew Moorman made a splash late last month with his talk at GigaOM’s Structure conference on vendor lock-in and the cloud. He argued that simply cloning proprietary APIs doesn’t solve the compatibility problem for developers that want to maintain ownership of their cloud applications.
Here, he explains and expands on that discussion. In order for true innovation to happen in the cloud, he says, we need to develop open standards as a community. It’s the best way to quickly advance modern computing.
It’s no secret that Rackspace is placing its bets with OpenStack, the open source cloud platform it launched with NASA in 2010 and will soon turn over to the independent OpenStack Foundation. With OpenStack, Moorman says, supporters are building an end-to-end alternative to proprietary cloud systems and are thus re-inventing the way modern networking happens.
This is the second article in a weekly series on Linux.com that will feature leaders of the open cloud in advance of The Linux Foundation’s CloudOpen conference  to be held Aug. 29-31 in San Diego. Last week’s post featured Richard Kaufmann, chief technologist for HP Cloud Services, who discussed how OpenStack can overcome the adoption hurdle.
Why build an open cloud? Join the conversation in our new open cloud forum. 
Q: How do you define open when it comes to the cloud?
Lew Moorman: The modern computer is really the datacenter. And a key question is: what kind of software runs on that computer? Is that software going to be open? Will it be community driven, free, open and extendable? And what will be the core operating system of the cloud? There needs to be an open alternative.
The proprietary world created Windows and the open world created Linux. It innovated on its own path and made Windows better. The open alternative really has to happen, not only for PCs and laptops but for the cloud. It really is the platform for modern computing.
OpenStack is setting out to be the operating system of the cloud. It has incredible traction and it’s the fastest growing open source project in history. It’s getting contributions from hundreds of companies and developers and maturing rapidly and many people are building businesses around it. It’s the best shot the world’s got for an open cloud.
Q: You created quite a stir in the press with your talk addressing vendor lock-in and the cloud at GigaOm’s Structure conference. What were you hoping to accomplish?
Moorman: Part of what I was talking about at Structure was trying to build awareness of what the cloud really is. The cloud is a very different way of running infrastructure and it depends on the application stack. And when you decide to build your datacenter or all your apps around a certain stack, whether Amazon, VMware or Microsoft, you need to recognize you’re making a big commitment to a stack. Your apps depend on that stack, as if you made a decision to run Java in Oracle databases. These are real commitments.
What we’re trying to make people aware of is there will be an open alternative and it may not be as mature as proprietary systems today, but it’s evolving and we’ll get there. It’s early in the cloud world.
We’re proposing that people be thoughtful about what they’re going to base their future apps on and make a conscious choice. I don’t think the proprietary world should go away. You could use both and many people will. But an ecosystem that’s more fluid and extendible and open is comforting to people. If you look at how modern apps are being built they’re so much more on open technologies.
It requires people to get involved and start using the technology and help it mature. Over time these open projects innovate.
Q: What did you mean when you said the cloud needs to be open from end to end, it’s not just about open APIs?
Moorman: Some people seem to think that APIs are the cloud and one thing that made the cloud so revolutionary is it’s programmatically accessible by API.  But (Amazon) S3 is a really complex distributed system. The issue with a model that says “clone Amazon” is that, unless you have the core technology underneath it, you can’t have a cloud.
We built Swift. It’s a totally distributed system and it’s not exactly like S3. Having API compatibility for the basics like loading and getting an object is very easy but these technologies do complex things and will always be different because there are different technologies underneath. The basic functionalities, like file systems, will be the same in the cloud but all you’ll ever get to is the lowest common denominator.
Q: What needs to happen to make your vision a reality?
Moorman: OpenStack is really setting out to build an open alternative from end to end. They say we’re going to do networking, not just set out to copy Amazon. They’re asking, “How should networking be done in the modern world?”
We need to really innovate and build a visionary system that can power the future of computing. Amazon, VMware and Microsoft don’t have all the answers.
Q: How is Rackspace involved in creating open standards and an open cloud?
Moorman: We’ve made massive investments in OpenStack and spent millions to get the project up and running. We will be handing it over to the OpenStack Foundation over the coming months and then we’ll just be another community member, but a big contributor to the code.
We at Rackspace are in the process of moving fully onto the code. By August the compute side of our cloud will be on OpenStack and we will be launching database and block storage offers that we’ve been working on for 18 or 24 months. We’re putting our money where our mouth is.
We’re also working to help people deploy privately and our services help with private deployments.  Eventually it will evolve from being deployed not just by specialists, but by your typical IT department.
Q: What are some lessons you’ve learned so far in moving to OpenStack?
Moorman: There’s no question these are incredibly complex technologies. We have found that open source methodology for any given project can move more slowly than if you did it yourself because of the community process. But the counterweight is that, because you have so many people participating that in the long run things start running so much faster. But it’s taken a bit longer than we would have liked. We were hopeful it would go faster.
It’s also been a process learning how to build software in the open and work with the community. It’s going, in almost every way, better than we would have expected. We’re working with a lot of companies doing proof of concept. It’s early days for the cloud and OpenStack is on the mind of pretty much everyone in big IT. It has real mindshare with that group and they’re kicking the tires. You can see the community momentum.
Q: How does Google’s entrance into the public cloud provider market change the open source scene dynamic?
Moorman: They’re another powerful proprietary stack. They’ll create a lot of good options for people and it helps validate the future of cloud computing. It looks like they’re targeting very large, at-scale buyers that typically do it themselves today. They have the scale and experience to help people with that. I’d love to see them to embrace an open system but they have their way of doing it and technology they’ve built themselves.
Q: What’s next for Rackspace?
Moorman: We have a whole bunch of products getting ready to launch. Connecting OpenStack from public into the private world is a great value proposition.
The Linux community has shown us the way. We have built our whole business on open technologies from the beginning. We started as a Linux only shop and have built so many internal tools using open technologies and Linux has been the heart of that. The future of computing will be built on open technologies, too.
