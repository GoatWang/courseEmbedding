Education[edit]
Leighton was educated at Heversham Grammar School, Cumbria and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Double First class Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences with Honours in Physics and Theoretical Physics in 1985. He stayed on to work in the Cavendish Laboratory and was awarded a PhD in 1988 for Image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography.[1][13]
Career and research[edit]
Following his PhD, Leighton was awarded Senior and Advanced Research fellowships at Magdalene College, Cambridge and the EPSRC. Leighton joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in 1992 as a Lecturer in Underwater Acoustics, and completed the monograph The Acoustic Bubble[2] in the same year. He was awarded a Personal Chair at the age of 35 and has authored over 400 publications.[8][14][15]
He has founded and leads a research group, and two research organizations (NAMRIP and HEFUA, see below). He conducts extensive outreach activities, particularly for schoolchildren, features on radio and video,[16] and serves on numerous national and international committees. An example lecture can be found at on the web.[17]
The breadth of his research covers medical, humanitarian and environmental sciences, beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications. His research interests cover acoustical oceanography, antimicrobial resistance.[citation needed] biomedical ultrasound, carbon capture and storage,[citation needed] climate change,[citation needed] decontamination,[citation needed] hospital acquired infections,[citation needed] marine zoology,[citation needed] ultrasound and underwater acoustics. The citation of the 2006 Paterson Medal of the Institute of Physics states that:


“
Timothy Leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth. His is an acknowledged world leader in four fields... He has delivered over 70 pioneering advances, from devices now used in hospitals to the world's first count of bubbles in the surf zone (crucial to our understanding of atmosphere-ocean gas flux, coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar). Behind these advances lies rigorous physics.[18]
”


He strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications (as his time as Associate Dean demonstrated[19]), but he also champions generating impact from research.[citation needed] Leighton strongly believes[citation needed] that if a technology is to help many people, it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers, and be sufficiently easy to use (no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science). That cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers, or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit R&D funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup R&D investment.[citation needed] Therefore, whilst he places high value on quality journal publications, these must form part of a publication strategy.[citation needed] With the exception of NAMRIP (see below), Leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changers,[citation needed] because he believes[citation needed] that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is, in much of research, a route to only incremental advances:


“
...We need to work with rigour, imagination, and wonder, unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names, or the history of projects in which we have previously worked, or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners, or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem. Then, when we eventually do find a solution, we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others, and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us.[14]
”


Leighton's research has been funded by the Royal Society,[4] the United States Department of Energy,[citation needed] the Science and Technology Facilities Council,[20] the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),[20] and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).[20] He has also self-funded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor - he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventions.[citation needed]

Inventions[edit]
Medical and healthcare[edit]
From fundamental science publications,[15] Leighton has invented systems for detecting bone disease (including osteoporosis).[24][25][26][26][11][27][28][29] He invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy, an invention that won the 2008 ‘Medical & Healthcare’ award from ‘The Engineer’[30] (key collaborator: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust).[31][32][33][34][35][36] His scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needle-free injectors for migraine sufferers (over 1 million sold).[31][37][38][39][40] He assisted the Institute of Cancer Research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring (2010).[41] He was a co-author of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning,[42] since which time 2 billion mothers and children have been scanned.[citation needed] He identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces, and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection, and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them.[43] He advises the Health Protection Agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.[citation needed]




StarStream device in 2014


Leighton is currently[when?] developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning (cleaning without heat or additives), saving water, energy and cost, and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking water.[citation needed] When cleaning, cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target (transplant organs, microchips etc.) which could not withstand heat or chemicals. Most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currently[when?] confidential as a result of patenting restrictions, but StarStream[31][44][45] is securely patented in many countries. It cleans down a stream of water, and in tests cleans whilst saving up to 80% water and electricity costs,[citation needed] with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water. One use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning: as New Scientist quoted Leighton:


“
... we're supposed to wash our hands for at least 20 seconds in hot soapy water – but in the UK, the average is 6 seconds in cold water. It’s not enough, and despite all the advertising, you can’t change people’s behaviour. Our answer is to change the water.[46]
”


StarStream won the Institution of Chemical Engineers Award for "Water Management and Supply";[47] the Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for Innovation,[48][49][49] and the S-lab Product of the Year 2014.[50][51][52] Multidisciplinary teams have shown that StarStream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant, removing bacterial biofilms, cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease prion.[53][54][55][56][57][58] It has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls.[59] Although safe for hands, StarStream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath (which is too hazardous for immersion of hands) in a side-by-side comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track,[60] a problem which costs the UK rail network £50 million each year.
The managing director of Ultrawave Ltd., John Melvile, described StarStream as:


“
... the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades... saving time and potentially lives[48][49]
”


Leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using StarSaver.[61] He says:


“
I want to build a not-for-profit, inexpensive, battery powered StarStream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world, making that water dual-use: you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink, or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis, because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide.[45]
”


Humanitarian[edit]
Leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives, hidden bugging devices, and for the location of buried catastrophe victims (in avalanches, mudslides, collapsed buildings etc.).[12] He invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water (key, for example, to protecting services, cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones).[62][63][64] Mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones. (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]). He has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed,[66][67][68][69][70][71] including one now sold by Kongsberg[72][73][74][75] for archaeological and civil engineering purposes. With his research associate Dr Craig Dolder, he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and Low- and Middle-Income Countries.[76]
Environmental[edit]
Leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks[77][78][79] from pipelines, and from methane seeps, by their acoustic emissions. He invented systems to assess leakage from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities,[78][79][80] and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed.[81][82][83] This is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and (eventually) the atmosphere (in the seabed, there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel, yet as a greenhouse gas methane is 20 times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide, so assessing how much is in the seabed, and how much leaks into the atmosphere, is a key task).[84] He made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean.[85][86][87][88] This is important for climate change modelling, because over 1000 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean. He worked as part of the team investigating whether man-made sounds can adversely affect benthic species (marine life that inhabits the seabed).[89][90] Such species have been overlooked in studies on how man-made sounds affect whales, dolphins and fish: benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species. Furthermore, benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment, turning it over and preventing it stagnating, and are key to the health of coastal marine environments.[91][92] (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]).
Other inventions[edit]
By predicting the soundscapes of other worlds [93][94][95] and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices, Leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds,[94][96][97] and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds.[98][99][100][101][102] He identified key uses of sound by whales [86][103][104] and dolphins.[12][63][86] He invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source ($1.3 billion) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US.[99][105][106][107][108]
Leadership[edit]
In addition to founding and leading his research group, after standing down as Associate Dean for Research for his Faculty in 2015 (where he achieved his stated aim of making his Faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national REF research census[19]) Leighton founded two organizations, which he leads:
NAMRIP[edit]
The Network for AntiMicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention (NAMRIP)[109] is a Strategic Research Group with the sole aim of combatting AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR) and promoting infection prevention. As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference:


“
...Unless preventative measures are found (and no-one in the world currently knows what those will be), AMR will (through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’) by 2050 be killing more people than cancer, and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy. We will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics; common medical procedures (minor surgery, childbirth) will become significantly more hazardous; and advances in treatments (such as those for childhood leukaemia) will become reversed.
”


He set up NAMRIP to search for the required solution, with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. As quoted by New Scientist,[46] he explained:


“
...I looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billion-dollar fund for new antibiotics, it would not sort out the problem; it might just buy us an extra decade. We need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in.[46]
”




“
...In many parts of the world, climate change and flooding, war, corruption, politics, received wisdom, traditions and religious practices, and the supply of fuel and money, play a far greater role in food, water, waste treatment, healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another, than do the outputs of the drug companies. The twin potential catastrophes are global, and so are the causes. The solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce; they lie with farmers, plumbers, office workers, water and sewage workers, medical practitioners, food retailers, innovators in business … indeed most of us. And they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies.[110]

In its first year, NAMRIP has grown to 170 members: engineers, chemists, microbiologists, environmental scientists, veterinary and human medics, clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions, experts in food, ethics and law, crucially networked with economists, geographers, health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to AMR and Infection Prevention (offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams). With almost weekly publications[111] and successes,[112] NAMRIP has delivered in terms of conducting research,[113] engaging with industry[114] to roll out solutions to society, and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach, education and dialogue.[115] In 2016 Leighton began a plan to roll out NAMRIP’s mission world-wide, particularly to Low/Middle Income Countries with not-for-profit interventions, through the formation of Global-NAMRIP.[116]
HEFUA[edit]
Health Effects of Ultrasound in Air (HEFUA)[117][118] has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places, and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans (following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing, and that current guidelines are inadequate).[43][119]
Outreach[edit]
Leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage, and possibly follow careers in, science and engineering, with school visits, science fairs, and appearances on TV and radio.[9][120]
Awards and honours[edit]
Leighton has been awarded the following medals and distinctions:

Fellowships[edit]
Leighton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2014.[4][5] His nomination reads:


“
Timothy Leighton is distinguished for his research on the acoustical physics of bubbles, especially their nonlinear behaviour; for his inventions and discoveries including bubble measurements in the surf zone, pipelines and methane seeps; for shock wave lithotripsy monitoring, disease detection in cancellous bone and needle free injection; for sonar systems that overcome bubble masking and numerous industrial applications. His seminal monograph The Acoustic Bubble has become the primary reference on bubble physical acoustics.[4]
”


Leighton was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng)[6] in 2012[1] for his services to Engineering and society.[127]
He was also elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 2000, Fellowship of Institute of Acoustics in 1999,[citation needed] Fellowship of the Acoustical Society of America in 1998,[citation needed] and Fellowship of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1988.[citation needed]

Education[edit]
Leighton was educated at Heversham Grammar School, Cumbria and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Double First class Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences with Honours in Physics and Theoretical Physics in 1985. He stayed on to work in the Cavendish Laboratory and was awarded a PhD in 1988 for Image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography.[1][13]
Career and research[edit]
Following his PhD, Leighton was awarded Senior and Advanced Research fellowships at Magdalene College, Cambridge and the EPSRC. Leighton joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in 1992 as a Lecturer in Underwater Acoustics, and completed the monograph The Acoustic Bubble[2] in the same year. He was awarded a Personal Chair at the age of 35 and has authored over 400 publications.[8][14][15]
He has founded and leads a research group, and two research organizations (NAMRIP and HEFUA, see below). He conducts extensive outreach activities, particularly for schoolchildren, features on radio and video,[16] and serves on numerous national and international committees. An example lecture can be found at on the web.[17]
The breadth of his research covers medical, humanitarian and environmental sciences, beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications. His research interests cover acoustical oceanography, antimicrobial resistance.[citation needed] biomedical ultrasound, carbon capture and storage,[citation needed] climate change,[citation needed] decontamination,[citation needed] hospital acquired infections,[citation needed] marine zoology,[citation needed] ultrasound and underwater acoustics. The citation of the 2006 Paterson Medal of the Institute of Physics states that:


“
Timothy Leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth. His is an acknowledged world leader in four fields... He has delivered over 70 pioneering advances, from devices now used in hospitals to the world's first count of bubbles in the surf zone (crucial to our understanding of atmosphere-ocean gas flux, coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar). Behind these advances lies rigorous physics.[18]
”


He strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications (as his time as Associate Dean demonstrated[19]), but he also champions generating impact from research.[citation needed] Leighton strongly believes[citation needed] that if a technology is to help many people, it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers, and be sufficiently easy to use (no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science). That cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers, or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit R&D funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup R&D investment.[citation needed] Therefore, whilst he places high value on quality journal publications, these must form part of a publication strategy.[citation needed] With the exception of NAMRIP (see below), Leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changers,[citation needed] because he believes[citation needed] that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is, in much of research, a route to only incremental advances:


“
...We need to work with rigour, imagination, and wonder, unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names, or the history of projects in which we have previously worked, or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners, or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem. Then, when we eventually do find a solution, we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others, and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us.[14]
”


Leighton's research has been funded by the Royal Society,[4] the United States Department of Energy,[citation needed] the Science and Technology Facilities Council,[20] the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),[20] and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).[20] He has also self-funded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor - he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventions.[citation needed]

Inventions[edit]
Medical and healthcare[edit]
From fundamental science publications,[15] Leighton has invented systems for detecting bone disease (including osteoporosis).[24][25][26][26][11][27][28][29] He invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy, an invention that won the 2008 ‘Medical & Healthcare’ award from ‘The Engineer’[30] (key collaborator: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust).[31][32][33][34][35][36] His scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needle-free injectors for migraine sufferers (over 1 million sold).[31][37][38][39][40] He assisted the Institute of Cancer Research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring (2010).[41] He was a co-author of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning,[42] since which time 2 billion mothers and children have been scanned.[citation needed] He identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces, and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection, and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them.[43] He advises the Health Protection Agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.[citation needed]




StarStream device in 2014


Leighton is currently[when?] developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning (cleaning without heat or additives), saving water, energy and cost, and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking water.[citation needed] When cleaning, cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target (transplant organs, microchips etc.) which could not withstand heat or chemicals. Most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currently[when?] confidential as a result of patenting restrictions, but StarStream[31][44][45] is securely patented in many countries. It cleans down a stream of water, and in tests cleans whilst saving up to 80% water and electricity costs,[citation needed] with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water. One use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning: as New Scientist quoted Leighton:


“
... we're supposed to wash our hands for at least 20 seconds in hot soapy water – but in the UK, the average is 6 seconds in cold water. It’s not enough, and despite all the advertising, you can’t change people’s behaviour. Our answer is to change the water.[46]
”


StarStream won the Institution of Chemical Engineers Award for "Water Management and Supply";[47] the Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for Innovation,[48][49][49] and the S-lab Product of the Year 2014.[50][51][52] Multidisciplinary teams have shown that StarStream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant, removing bacterial biofilms, cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease prion.[53][54][55][56][57][58] It has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls.[59] Although safe for hands, StarStream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath (which is too hazardous for immersion of hands) in a side-by-side comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track,[60] a problem which costs the UK rail network £50 million each year.
The managing director of Ultrawave Ltd., John Melvile, described StarStream as:


“
... the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades... saving time and potentially lives[48][49]
”


Leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using StarSaver.[61] He says:


“
I want to build a not-for-profit, inexpensive, battery powered StarStream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world, making that water dual-use: you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink, or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis, because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide.[45]
”


Humanitarian[edit]
Leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives, hidden bugging devices, and for the location of buried catastrophe victims (in avalanches, mudslides, collapsed buildings etc.).[12] He invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water (key, for example, to protecting services, cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones).[62][63][64] Mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones. (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]). He has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed,[66][67][68][69][70][71] including one now sold by Kongsberg[72][73][74][75] for archaeological and civil engineering purposes. With his research associate Dr Craig Dolder, he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and Low- and Middle-Income Countries.[76]
Environmental[edit]
Leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks[77][78][79] from pipelines, and from methane seeps, by their acoustic emissions. He invented systems to assess leakage from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities,[78][79][80] and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed.[81][82][83] This is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and (eventually) the atmosphere (in the seabed, there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel, yet as a greenhouse gas methane is 20 times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide, so assessing how much is in the seabed, and how much leaks into the atmosphere, is a key task).[84] He made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean.[85][86][87][88] This is important for climate change modelling, because over 1000 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean. He worked as part of the team investigating whether man-made sounds can adversely affect benthic species (marine life that inhabits the seabed).[89][90] Such species have been overlooked in studies on how man-made sounds affect whales, dolphins and fish: benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species. Furthermore, benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment, turning it over and preventing it stagnating, and are key to the health of coastal marine environments.[91][92] (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]).
Other inventions[edit]
By predicting the soundscapes of other worlds [93][94][95] and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices, Leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds,[94][96][97] and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds.[98][99][100][101][102] He identified key uses of sound by whales [86][103][104] and dolphins.[12][63][86] He invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source ($1.3 billion) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US.[99][105][106][107][108]
Leadership[edit]
In addition to founding and leading his research group, after standing down as Associate Dean for Research for his Faculty in 2015 (where he achieved his stated aim of making his Faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national REF research census[19]) Leighton founded two organizations, which he leads:
NAMRIP[edit]
The Network for AntiMicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention (NAMRIP)[109] is a Strategic Research Group with the sole aim of combatting AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR) and promoting infection prevention. As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference:


“
...Unless preventative measures are found (and no-one in the world currently knows what those will be), AMR will (through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’) by 2050 be killing more people than cancer, and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy. We will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics; common medical procedures (minor surgery, childbirth) will become significantly more hazardous; and advances in treatments (such as those for childhood leukaemia) will become reversed.
”


He set up NAMRIP to search for the required solution, with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. As quoted by New Scientist,[46] he explained:


“
...I looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billion-dollar fund for new antibiotics, it would not sort out the problem; it might just buy us an extra decade. We need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in.[46]
”




“
...In many parts of the world, climate change and flooding, war, corruption, politics, received wisdom, traditions and religious practices, and the supply of fuel and money, play a far greater role in food, water, waste treatment, healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another, than do the outputs of the drug companies. The twin potential catastrophes are global, and so are the causes. The solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce; they lie with farmers, plumbers, office workers, water and sewage workers, medical practitioners, food retailers, innovators in business … indeed most of us. And they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies.[110]
”


In its first year, NAMRIP has grown to 170 members: engineers, chemists, microbiologists, environmental scientists, veterinary and human medics, clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions, experts in food, ethics and law, crucially networked with economists, geographers, health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to AMR and Infection Prevention (offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams). With almost weekly publications[111] and successes,[112] NAMRIP has delivered in terms of conducting research,[113] engaging with industry[114] to roll out solutions to society, and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach, education and dialogue.[115] In 2016 Leighton began a plan to roll out NAMRIP’s mission world-wide, particularly to Low/Middle Income Countries with not-for-profit interventions, through the formation of Global-NAMRIP.[116]
HEFUA[edit]
Health Effects of Ultrasound in Air (HEFUA)[117][118] has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places, and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans (following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing, and that current guidelines are inadequate).[43][119]
Outreach[edit]
Leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage, and possibly follow careers in, science and engineering, with school visits, science fairs, and appearances on TV and radio.[9][120]

Leighton has been awarded the following medals and distinctions:

Education[edit]
Leighton was educated at Heversham Grammar School, Cumbria and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Double First class Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences with Honours in Physics and Theoretical Physics in 1985. He stayed on to work in the Cavendish Laboratory and was awarded a PhD in 1988 for Image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography.[1][13]
Career and research[edit]
Following his PhD, Leighton was awarded Senior and Advanced Research fellowships at Magdalene College, Cambridge and the EPSRC. Leighton joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in 1992 as a Lecturer in Underwater Acoustics, and completed the monograph The Acoustic Bubble[2] in the same year. He was awarded a Personal Chair at the age of 35 and has authored over 400 publications.[8][14][15]
He has founded and leads a research group, and two research organizations (NAMRIP and HEFUA, see below). He conducts extensive outreach activities, particularly for schoolchildren, features on radio and video,[16] and serves on numerous national and international committees. An example lecture can be found at on the web.[17]
The breadth of his research covers medical, humanitarian and environmental sciences, beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications. His research interests cover acoustical oceanography, antimicrobial resistance.[citation needed] biomedical ultrasound, carbon capture and storage,[citation needed] climate change,[citation needed] decontamination,[citation needed] hospital acquired infections,[citation needed] marine zoology,[citation needed] ultrasound and underwater acoustics. The citation of the 2006 Paterson Medal of the Institute of Physics states that:


“
Timothy Leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth. His is an acknowledged world leader in four fields... He has delivered over 70 pioneering advances, from devices now used in hospitals to the world's first count of bubbles in the surf zone (crucial to our understanding of atmosphere-ocean gas flux, coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar). Behind these advances lies rigorous physics.[18]
”


He strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications (as his time as Associate Dean demonstrated[19]), but he also champions generating impact from research.[citation needed] Leighton strongly believes[citation needed] that if a technology is to help many people, it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers, and be sufficiently easy to use (no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science). That cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers, or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit R&D funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup R&D investment.[citation needed] Therefore, whilst he places high value on quality journal publications, these must form part of a publication strategy.[citation needed] With the exception of NAMRIP (see below), Leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changers,[citation needed] because he believes[citation needed] that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is, in much of research, a route to only incremental advances:


“
...We need to work with rigour, imagination, and wonder, unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names, or the history of projects in which we have previously worked, or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners, or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem. Then, when we eventually do find a solution, we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others, and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us.[14]
”


Leighton's research has been funded by the Royal Society,[4] the United States Department of Energy,[citation needed] the Science and Technology Facilities Council,[20] the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),[20] and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).[20] He has also self-funded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor - he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventions.[citation needed]

Inventions[edit]
Medical and healthcare[edit]
From fundamental science publications,[15] Leighton has invented systems for detecting bone disease (including osteoporosis).[24][25][26][26][11][27][28][29] He invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy, an invention that won the 2008 ‘Medical & Healthcare’ award from ‘The Engineer’[30] (key collaborator: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust).[31][32][33][34][35][36] His scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needle-free injectors for migraine sufferers (over 1 million sold).[31][37][38][39][40] He assisted the Institute of Cancer Research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring (2010).[41] He was a co-author of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning,[42] since which time 2 billion mothers and children have been scanned.[citation needed] He identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces, and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection, and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them.[43] He advises the Health Protection Agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.[citation needed]




StarStream device in 2014


Leighton is currently[when?] developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning (cleaning without heat or additives), saving water, energy and cost, and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking water.[citation needed] When cleaning, cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target (transplant organs, microchips etc.) which could not withstand heat or chemicals. Most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currently[when?] confidential as a result of patenting restrictions, but StarStream[31][44][45] is securely patented in many countries. It cleans down a stream of water, and in tests cleans whilst saving up to 80% water and electricity costs,[citation needed] with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water. One use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning: as New Scientist quoted Leighton:


“
... we're supposed to wash our hands for at least 20 seconds in hot soapy water – but in the UK, the average is 6 seconds in cold water. It’s not enough, and despite all the advertising, you can’t change people’s behaviour. Our answer is to change the water.[46]
”


StarStream won the Institution of Chemical Engineers Award for "Water Management and Supply";[47] the Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for Innovation,[48][49][49] and the S-lab Product of the Year 2014.[50][51][52] Multidisciplinary teams have shown that StarStream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant, removing bacterial biofilms, cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease prion.[53][54][55][56][57][58] It has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls.[59] Although safe for hands, StarStream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath (which is too hazardous for immersion of hands) in a side-by-side comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track,[60] a problem which costs the UK rail network £50 million each year.
The managing director of Ultrawave Ltd., John Melvile, described StarStream as:


“
... the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades... saving time and potentially lives[48][49]
”


Leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using StarSaver.[61] He says:


“
I want to build a not-for-profit, inexpensive, battery powered StarStream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world, making that water dual-use: you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink, or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis, because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide.[45]
”


Humanitarian[edit]
Leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives, hidden bugging devices, and for the location of buried catastrophe victims (in avalanches, mudslides, collapsed buildings etc.).[12] He invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water (key, for example, to protecting services, cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones).[62][63][64] Mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones. (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]). He has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed,[66][67][68][69][70][71] including one now sold by Kongsberg[72][73][74][75] for archaeological and civil engineering purposes. With his research associate Dr Craig Dolder, he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and Low- and Middle-Income Countries.[76]
Environmental[edit]
Leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks[77][78][79] from pipelines, and from methane seeps, by their acoustic emissions. He invented systems to assess leakage from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities,[78][79][80] and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed.[81][82][83] This is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and (eventually) the atmosphere (in the seabed, there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel, yet as a greenhouse gas methane is 20 times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide, so assessing how much is in the seabed, and how much leaks into the atmosphere, is a key task).[84] He made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean.[85][86][87][88] This is important for climate change modelling, because over 1000 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean. He worked as part of the team investigating whether man-made sounds can adversely affect benthic species (marine life that inhabits the seabed).[89][90] Such species have been overlooked in studies on how man-made sounds affect whales, dolphins and fish: benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species. Furthermore, benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment, turning it over and preventing it stagnating, and are key to the health of coastal marine environments.[91][92] (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]).
Other inventions[edit]
By predicting the soundscapes of other worlds [93][94][95] and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices, Leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds,[94][96][97] and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds.[98][99][100][101][102] He identified key uses of sound by whales [86][103][104] and dolphins.[12][63][86] He invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source ($1.3 billion) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US.[99][105][106][107][108]
Leadership[edit]
In addition to founding and leading his research group, after standing down as Associate Dean for Research for his Faculty in 2015 (where he achieved his stated aim of making his Faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national REF research census[19]) Leighton founded two organizations, which he leads:
NAMRIP[edit]
The Network for AntiMicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention (NAMRIP)[109] is a Strategic Research Group with the sole aim of combatting AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR) and promoting infection prevention. As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference:


“
...Unless preventative measures are found (and no-one in the world currently knows what those will be), AMR will (through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’) by 2050 be killing more people than cancer, and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy. We will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics; common medical procedures (minor surgery, childbirth) will become significantly more hazardous; and advances in treatments (such as those for childhood leukaemia) will become reversed.
”


He set up NAMRIP to search for the required solution, with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. As quoted by New Scientist,[46] he explained:


“
...I looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billion-dollar fund for new antibiotics, it would not sort out the problem; it might just buy us an extra decade. We need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in.[46]
”




“
...In many parts of the world, climate change and flooding, war, corruption, politics, received wisdom, traditions and religious practices, and the supply of fuel and money, play a far greater role in food, water, waste treatment, healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another, than do the outputs of the drug companies. The twin potential catastrophes are global, and so are the causes. The solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce; they lie with farmers, plumbers, office workers, water and sewage workers, medical practitioners, food retailers, innovators in business … indeed most of us. And they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies.[110]
”


In its first year, NAMRIP has grown to 170 members: engineers, chemists, microbiologists, environmental scientists, veterinary and human medics, clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions, experts in food, ethics and law, crucially networked with economists, geographers, health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to AMR and Infection Prevention (offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams). With almost weekly publications[111] and successes,[112] NAMRIP has delivered in terms of conducting research,[113] engaging with industry[114] to roll out solutions to society, and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach, education and dialogue.[115] In 2016 Leighton began a plan to roll out NAMRIP’s mission world-wide, particularly to Low/Middle Income Countries with not-for-profit interventions, through the formation of Global-NAMRIP.[116]
HEFUA[edit]
Health Effects of Ultrasound in Air (HEFUA)[117][118] has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places, and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans (following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing, and that current guidelines are inadequate).[43][119]
Outreach[edit]
Leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage, and possibly follow careers in, science and engineering, with school visits, science fairs, and appearances on TV and radio.[9][120]

Education[edit]
Leighton was educated at Heversham Grammar School, Cumbria and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Double First class Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences with Honours in Physics and Theoretical Physics in 1985. He stayed on to work in the Cavendish Laboratory and was awarded a PhD in 1988 for Image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography.[1][13]
Career and research[edit]
Following his PhD, Leighton was awarded Senior and Advanced Research fellowships at Magdalene College, Cambridge and the EPSRC. Leighton joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in 1992 as a Lecturer in Underwater Acoustics, and completed the monograph The Acoustic Bubble[2] in the same year. He was awarded a Personal Chair at the age of 35 and has authored over 400 publications.[8][14][15]
He has founded and leads a research group, and two research organizations (NAMRIP and HEFUA, see below). He conducts extensive outreach activities, particularly for schoolchildren, features on radio and video,[16] and serves on numerous national and international committees. An example lecture can be found at on the web.[17]
The breadth of his research covers medical, humanitarian and environmental sciences, beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications. His research interests cover acoustical oceanography, antimicrobial resistance.[citation needed] biomedical ultrasound, carbon capture and storage,[citation needed] climate change,[citation needed] decontamination,[citation needed] hospital acquired infections,[citation needed] marine zoology,[citation needed] ultrasound and underwater acoustics. The citation of the 2006 Paterson Medal of the Institute of Physics states that:


“
Timothy Leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth. His is an acknowledged world leader in four fields... He has delivered over 70 pioneering advances, from devices now used in hospitals to the world's first count of bubbles in the surf zone (crucial to our understanding of atmosphere-ocean gas flux, coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar). Behind these advances lies rigorous physics.[18]
”


He strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications (as his time as Associate Dean demonstrated[19]), but he also champions generating impact from research.[citation needed] Leighton strongly believes[citation needed] that if a technology is to help many people, it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers, and be sufficiently easy to use (no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science). That cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers, or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit R&D funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup R&D investment.[citation needed] Therefore, whilst he places high value on quality journal publications, these must form part of a publication strategy.[citation needed] With the exception of NAMRIP (see below), Leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changers,[citation needed] because he believes[citation needed] that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is, in much of research, a route to only incremental advances:


“
...We need to work with rigour, imagination, and wonder, unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names, or the history of projects in which we have previously worked, or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners, or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem. Then, when we eventually do find a solution, we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others, and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us.[14]
”


Leighton's research has been funded by the Royal Society,[4] the United States Department of Energy,[citation needed] the Science and Technology Facilities Council,[20] the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),[20] and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).[20] He has also self-funded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor - he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventions.[citation needed]

Inventions[edit]
Medical and healthcare[edit]
From fundamental science publications,[15] Leighton has invented systems for detecting bone disease (including osteoporosis).[24][25][26][26][11][27][28][29] He invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy, an invention that won the 2008 ‘Medical & Healthcare’ award from ‘The Engineer’[30] (key collaborator: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust).[31][32][33][34][35][36] His scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needle-free injectors for migraine sufferers (over 1 million sold).[31][37][38][39][40] He assisted the Institute of Cancer Research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring (2010).[41] He was a co-author of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning,[42] since which time 2 billion mothers and children have been scanned.[citation needed] He identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces, and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection, and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them.[43] He advises the Health Protection Agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.[citation needed]




StarStream device in 2014


Leighton is currently[when?] developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning (cleaning without heat or additives), saving water, energy and cost, and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking water.[citation needed] When cleaning, cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target (transplant organs, microchips etc.) which could not withstand heat or chemicals. Most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currently[when?] confidential as a result of patenting restrictions, but StarStream[31][44][45] is securely patented in many countries. It cleans down a stream of water, and in tests cleans whilst saving up to 80% water and electricity costs,[citation needed] with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water. One use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning: as New Scientist quoted Leighton:


“
... we're supposed to wash our hands for at least 20 seconds in hot soapy water – but in the UK, the average is 6 seconds in cold water. It’s not enough, and despite all the advertising, you can’t change people’s behaviour. Our answer is to change the water.[46]
”


StarStream won the Institution of Chemical Engineers Award for "Water Management and Supply";[47] the Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for Innovation,[48][49][49] and the S-lab Product of the Year 2014.[50][51][52] Multidisciplinary teams have shown that StarStream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant, removing bacterial biofilms, cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease prion.[53][54][55][56][57][58] It has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls.[59] Although safe for hands, StarStream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath (which is too hazardous for immersion of hands) in a side-by-side comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track,[60] a problem which costs the UK rail network £50 million each year.
The managing director of Ultrawave Ltd., John Melvile, described StarStream as:


“
... the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades... saving time and potentially lives[48][49]
”


Leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using StarSaver.[61] He says:


“
I want to build a not-for-profit, inexpensive, battery powered StarStream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world, making that water dual-use: you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink, or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis, because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide.[45]
”


Humanitarian[edit]
Leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives, hidden bugging devices, and for the location of buried catastrophe victims (in avalanches, mudslides, collapsed buildings etc.).[12] He invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water (key, for example, to protecting services, cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones).[62][63][64] Mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones. (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]). He has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed,[66][67][68][69][70][71] including one now sold by Kongsberg[72][73][74][75] for archaeological and civil engineering purposes. With his research associate Dr Craig Dolder, he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and Low- and Middle-Income Countries.[76]
Environmental[edit]
Leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks[77][78][79] from pipelines, and from methane seeps, by their acoustic emissions. He invented systems to assess leakage from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities,[78][79][80] and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed.[81][82][83] This is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and (eventually) the atmosphere (in the seabed, there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel, yet as a greenhouse gas methane is 20 times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide, so assessing how much is in the seabed, and how much leaks into the atmosphere, is a key task).[84] He made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean.[85][86][87][88] This is important for climate change modelling, because over 1000 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean. He worked as part of the team investigating whether man-made sounds can adversely affect benthic species (marine life that inhabits the seabed).[89][90] Such species have been overlooked in studies on how man-made sounds affect whales, dolphins and fish: benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species. Furthermore, benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment, turning it over and preventing it stagnating, and are key to the health of coastal marine environments.[91][92] (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]).
Other inventions[edit]
By predicting the soundscapes of other worlds [93][94][95] and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices, Leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds,[94][96][97] and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds.[98][99][100][101][102] He identified key uses of sound by whales [86][103][104] and dolphins.[12][63][86] He invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source ($1.3 billion) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US.[99][105][106][107][108]
Leadership[edit]
In addition to founding and leading his research group, after standing down as Associate Dean for Research for his Faculty in 2015 (where he achieved his stated aim of making his Faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national REF research census[19]) Leighton founded two organizations, which he leads:
NAMRIP[edit]
The Network for AntiMicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention (NAMRIP)[109] is a Strategic Research Group with the sole aim of combatting AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR) and promoting infection prevention. As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference:


“
...Unless preventative measures are found (and no-one in the world currently knows what those will be), AMR will (through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’) by 2050 be killing more people than cancer, and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy. We will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics; common medical procedures (minor surgery, childbirth) will become significantly more hazardous; and advances in treatments (such as those for childhood leukaemia) will become reversed.
”


He set up NAMRIP to search for the required solution, with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. As quoted by New Scientist,[46] he explained:


“
...I looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billion-dollar fund for new antibiotics, it would not sort out the problem; it might just buy us an extra decade. We need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in.[46]
”




“
...In many parts of the world, climate change and flooding, war, corruption, politics, received wisdom, traditions and religious practices, and the supply of fuel and money, play a far greater role in food, water, waste treatment, healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another, than do the outputs of the drug companies. The twin potential catastrophes are global, and so are the causes. The solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce; they lie with farmers, plumbers, office workers, water and sewage workers, medical practitioners, food retailers, innovators in business … indeed most of us. And they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies.[110]
”


In its first year, NAMRIP has grown to 170 members: engineers, chemists, microbiologists, environmental scientists, veterinary and human medics, clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions, experts in food, ethics and law, crucially networked with economists, geographers, health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to AMR and Infection Prevention (offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams). With almost weekly publications[111] and successes,[112] NAMRIP has delivered in terms of conducting research,[113] engaging with industry[114] to roll out solutions to society, and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach, education and dialogue.[115] In 2016 Leighton began a plan to roll out NAMRIP’s mission world-wide, particularly to Low/Middle Income Countries with not-for-profit interventions, through the formation of Global-NAMRIP.[116]
HEFUA[edit]
Health Effects of Ultrasound in Air (HEFUA)[117][118] has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places, and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans (following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing, and that current guidelines are inadequate).[43][119]
Outreach[edit]
Leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage, and possibly follow careers in, science and engineering, with school visits, science fairs, and appearances on TV and radio.[9][120]

Education[edit]
Leighton was educated at Heversham Grammar School, Cumbria and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he was awarded a Double First class Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences with Honours in Physics and Theoretical Physics in 1985. He stayed on to work in the Cavendish Laboratory and was awarded a PhD in 1988 for Image intensifier studies of sonoluminescence with applications to medical ultrasonography.[1][13]
Career and research[edit]
Following his PhD, Leighton was awarded Senior and Advanced Research fellowships at Magdalene College, Cambridge and the EPSRC. Leighton joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in 1992 as a Lecturer in Underwater Acoustics, and completed the monograph The Acoustic Bubble[2] in the same year. He was awarded a Personal Chair at the age of 35 and has authored over 400 publications.[8][14][15]
He has founded and leads a research group, and two research organizations (NAMRIP and HEFUA, see below). He conducts extensive outreach activities, particularly for schoolchildren, features on radio and video,[16] and serves on numerous national and international committees. An example lecture can be found at on the web.[17]
The breadth of his research covers medical, humanitarian and environmental sciences, beginning with the fundamental math and ending with engineering applications. His research interests cover acoustical oceanography, antimicrobial resistance.[citation needed] biomedical ultrasound, carbon capture and storage,[citation needed] climate change,[citation needed] decontamination,[citation needed] hospital acquired infections,[citation needed] marine zoology,[citation needed] ultrasound and underwater acoustics. The citation of the 2006 Paterson Medal of the Institute of Physics states that:


“
Timothy Leighton’s contribution is outstanding in both breadth and depth. His is an acknowledged world leader in four fields... He has delivered over 70 pioneering advances, from devices now used in hospitals to the world's first count of bubbles in the surf zone (crucial to our understanding of atmosphere-ocean gas flux, coastal erosion and the optimisation of military sonar). Behind these advances lies rigorous physics.[18]
”


He strongly champions high quality peer reviewed journal publications (as his time as Associate Dean demonstrated[19]), but he also champions generating impact from research.[citation needed] Leighton strongly believes[citation needed] that if a technology is to help many people, it has to be deployed in sufficient numbers, and be sufficiently easy to use (no matter how complex and revolutionary the underlying science). That cannot be done if a technology remains unread in high quality published papers, or early publication prevents award of the patent that a manufacturer will need to have sufficient security to commit R&D funds by reducing the threat of them later being undercut by a reverse engineered product that was not priced to recoup R&D investment.[citation needed] Therefore, whilst he places high value on quality journal publications, these must form part of a publication strategy.[citation needed] With the exception of NAMRIP (see below), Leighton also has a record of opening up new fields in the hope of producing game changers,[citation needed] because he believes[citation needed] that incremental research in topics that the consensus of researchers and sponsors believe valuable is, in much of research, a route to only incremental advances:


“
...We need to work with rigour, imagination, and wonder, unconstrained by the artificial boundaries set in place by discipline names, or the history of projects in which we have previously worked, or the tendency of sponsors to believe they can pick winners, or above all by the belief that we must jump to solutions when we have not yet perceived the real problem. Then, when we eventually do find a solution, we must have the will to push it through all the way to help others, and not simply publish in the expectation that someone will finish the job for us.[14]
”


Leighton's research has been funded by the Royal Society,[4] the United States Department of Energy,[citation needed] the Science and Technology Facilities Council,[20] the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),[20] and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).[20] He has also self-funded research ideas that cannot attract a sponsor - he has done this by raising funds by licensing his inventions.[citation needed]

Inventions[edit]
Medical and healthcare[edit]
From fundamental science publications,[15] Leighton has invented systems for detecting bone disease (including osteoporosis).[24][25][26][26][11][27][28][29] He invented devices for monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy, an invention that won the 2008 ‘Medical & Healthcare’ award from ‘The Engineer’[30] (key collaborator: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust).[31][32][33][34][35][36] His scientific contributions are credited by industry for the manufacture of needle-free injectors for migraine sufferers (over 1 million sold).[31][37][38][39][40] He assisted the Institute of Cancer Research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring (2010).[41] He was a co-author of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning,[42] since which time 2 billion mothers and children have been scanned.[citation needed] He identified the mass exposure of the public to ultrasound in public spaces, and placed this in the context of inadequate current guidelines for public protection, and inadequate standards for instrumentation and procedures for measuring such exposures and the human response to them.[43] He advises the Health Protection Agency on the safety of ultrasound and provides scientific advice to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.[citation needed]




StarStream device in 2014


Leighton is currently[when?] developing several inventions to achieve cold water cleaning (cleaning without heat or additives), saving water, energy and cost, and making the water easier to later convert back to drinking water.[citation needed] When cleaning, cold water without chemicals might also be required by the target (transplant organs, microchips etc.) which could not withstand heat or chemicals. Most of these ‘cold water cleaning’ inventions are currently[when?] confidential as a result of patenting restrictions, but StarStream[31][44][45] is securely patented in many countries. It cleans down a stream of water, and in tests cleans whilst saving up to 80% water and electricity costs,[citation needed] with no additives so that the water can more easily be returned to drinking water. One use is to reduce infections by improving hand cleaning: as New Scientist quoted Leighton:


“
... we're supposed to wash our hands for at least 20 seconds in hot soapy water – but in the UK, the average is 6 seconds in cold water. It’s not enough, and despite all the advertising, you can’t change people’s behaviour. Our answer is to change the water.[46]
”


StarStream won the Institution of Chemical Engineers Award for "Water Management and Supply";[47] the Royal Society Brian Mercer Award for Innovation,[48][49][49] and the S-lab Product of the Year 2014.[50][51][52] Multidisciplinary teams have shown that StarStream is effective at cleaning bone prior to transplant, removing bacterial biofilms, cleaning skin and decontaminating surgical steel of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease prion.[53][54][55][56][57][58] It has also removed marine antifouling from ship hulls.[59] Although safe for hands, StarStream proved to be more effective than an ultrasonic cleaning bath (which is too hazardous for immersion of hands) in a side-by-side comparison for cleaning crushed ‘leaves on the line’ contaminant from railway track,[60] a problem which costs the UK rail network £50 million each year.
The managing director of Ultrawave Ltd., John Melvile, described StarStream as:


“
... the only true technological leap forward in ultrasonic cleaning that we have seen for decades... saving time and potentially lives[48][49]
”


Leighton is trying to raise funds to bring infection prevention worldwide using StarSaver.[61] He says:


“
I want to build a not-for-profit, inexpensive, battery powered StarStream nozzle that could fit on any drinking water bottle in the world, making that water dual-use: you could save someone with your water bottle either by giving them a drink, or cleaning their wounds to prevent sepsis, because bottled water represents the only clean water in many parts of the worldwide.[45]
”


Humanitarian[edit]
Leighton invented radar for the detection of buried explosives, hidden bugging devices, and for the location of buried catastrophe victims (in avalanches, mudslides, collapsed buildings etc.).[12] He invented the world’s only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water (key, for example, to protecting services, cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones).[62][63][64] Mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones. (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]). He has worked on a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed,[66][67][68][69][70][71] including one now sold by Kongsberg[72][73][74][75] for archaeological and civil engineering purposes. With his research associate Dr Craig Dolder, he is inventing ways of producing clean water from waste in both industrialized and Low- and Middle-Income Countries.[76]
Environmental[edit]
Leighton invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks[77][78][79] from pipelines, and from methane seeps, by their acoustic emissions. He invented systems to assess leakage from Carbon Capture and Storage Facilities,[78][79][80] and to assess the amount of methane in the seabed.[81][82][83] This is important in order to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and (eventually) the atmosphere (in the seabed, there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel, yet as a greenhouse gas methane is 20 times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide, so assessing how much is in the seabed, and how much leaks into the atmosphere, is a key task).[84] He made measurements of key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean.[85][86][87][88] This is important for climate change modelling, because over 1000 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean. He worked as part of the team investigating whether man-made sounds can adversely affect benthic species (marine life that inhabits the seabed).[89][90] Such species have been overlooked in studies on how man-made sounds affect whales, dolphins and fish: benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species. Furthermore, benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment, turning it over and preventing it stagnating, and are key to the health of coastal marine environments.[91][92] (Key collaborator: Paul White[65]).
Other inventions[edit]
By predicting the soundscapes of other worlds [93][94][95] and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices, Leighton developed devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds,[94][96][97] and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds.[98][99][100][101][102] He identified key uses of sound by whales [86][103][104] and dolphins.[12][63][86] He invented sensors for assist safety procedures in the world’s most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source ($1.3 billion) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US.[99][105][106][107][108]
Leadership[edit]
In addition to founding and leading his research group, after standing down as Associate Dean for Research for his Faculty in 2015 (where he achieved his stated aim of making his Faculty ‘top for power’ in engineering in the national REF research census[19]) Leighton founded two organizations, which he leads:
NAMRIP[edit]
The Network for AntiMicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention (NAMRIP)[109] is a Strategic Research Group with the sole aim of combatting AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR) and promoting infection prevention. As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference:


“
...Unless preventative measures are found (and no-one in the world currently knows what those will be), AMR will (through the colloquial ‘rise of superbugs’) by 2050 be killing more people than cancer, and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy. We will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics; common medical procedures (minor surgery, childbirth) will become significantly more hazardous; and advances in treatments (such as those for childhood leukaemia) will become reversed.
”


He set up NAMRIP to search for the required solution, with particular emphasis to finding an alternative to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. As quoted by New Scientist,[46] he explained:


“
...I looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billion-dollar fund for new antibiotics, it would not sort out the problem; it might just buy us an extra decade. We need a new approach – a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in.[46]
”




“
...In many parts of the world, climate change and flooding, war, corruption, politics, received wisdom, traditions and religious practices, and the supply of fuel and money, play a far greater role in food, water, waste treatment, healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another, than do the outputs of the drug companies. The twin potential catastrophes are global, and so are the causes. The solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce; they lie with farmers, plumbers, office workers, water and sewage workers, medical practitioners, food retailers, innovators in business … indeed most of us. And they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world – not just the pharmaceutical companies.[110]
”


In its first year, NAMRIP has grown to 170 members: engineers, chemists, microbiologists, environmental scientists, veterinary and human medics, clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions, experts in food, ethics and law, crucially networked with economists, geographers, health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to AMR and Infection Prevention (offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams). With almost weekly publications[111] and successes,[112] NAMRIP has delivered in terms of conducting research,[113] engaging with industry[114] to roll out solutions to society, and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach, education and dialogue.[115] In 2016 Leighton began a plan to roll out NAMRIP’s mission world-wide, particularly to Low/Middle Income Countries with not-for-profit interventions, through the formation of Global-NAMRIP.[116]
HEFUA[edit]
Health Effects of Ultrasound in Air (HEFUA)[117][118] has been formed to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places, and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans (following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing, and that current guidelines are inadequate).[43][119]
Outreach[edit]
Leighton has contributed to outreach and the encouragement of young men and women to engage, and possibly follow careers in, science and engineering, with school visits, science fairs, and appearances on TV and radio.[9][120]
