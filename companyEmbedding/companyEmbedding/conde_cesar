Under Conde’s leadership, Telemundo hit a historic milestone in 2016, by ranking as the #1 Spanish-language network.[4]
Prior to this, Conde was at Univision for ten years, from 2003 to 2013. During this time he held a number of senior positions including Special assistant to the CEO; interim president of Univision Interactive Media; vice president and operating manager of the Galavisión Network (where he was responsible for all of its functions, including programming, promotions, operations, talent relations and original productions); vice president of Corporate Development for the Univision Networks; and vice president of Sales and Business Development at the Univision Network.

His career began in investment banking at Salomon Smith Barney in their Mergers and Acquisitions Group.

Early life[edit]

He is the oldest of three brothers; his two brothers are Jorge Conde, currently the CEO of genomics firm Knome Inc. and Enrique Conde, and attorney for prominent nationwide law firm Greenberg Traurig.
Before enrolling in Harvard, Conde attended the Belen Jesuit Preparatory High School where he stood out academically as well as athletically. In 1990-91 Conde joined The Herald's All-Dade boys' tennis team[6] recognized in 1990-91 as an All-County athlete.[7]

Education initiatives[edit]
Conde is very active in the development of educational opportunities for the Hispanic community. In 2005 he co-founded the Futuro Program, a non-profit organization that provides role models and educational workshops to Hispanic high school students. In 2009, Conde spearheaded the launch of Univision's "Es el Momento" (The moment is now) campaign a comprehensive effort focused on informing the Hispanic community of the importance of education. The campaign has received support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation among other sponsors and in March 2011, shortly after launching its second phase, a Town Hall event with President Barack Obama[9] was organized and broadcast to over 2.7 million viewers[10] around the country. The Futuro program has become a part of the Es el momento campaign. On May 2011, President Barack Obama announced the appointment of Conde as a member of the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics[11] and on September 2012, Conde was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Excellence in Education[12]

Community initiatives[edit]
During his time at Univision, Conde has led the company to enter into several partnerships that drove national community initiatives and empowerment campaigns. One of these campaign is “Ya es hora”, a historic non-partisan Latino civic participation campaign launched in several phases which encouraged eligible Hispanics to become US Citizens,register to vote and exercise their right to vote.
With the goal of improving the quality of life of disabled children, Conde spearheaded the development of Univision's first ever Teletón USA event, a 28-hour coast-to-coast televised fundraising event that exceeded expectations by raising over 15 million dollars. All proceeds go to help families in the U.S. and toward the construction of the first “Centro de Rehabilitación Infantil Teletón” (CRIT) which will be based in San Antonio, Texas.
At Telemundo, Conde was the driving force behind the launch of "El Poder En Ti,"[13] a community platform focusing on three areas of importance to U.S. Hispanics: education (Tú Educación), health (Tú Salud), and finance (Tú Dinero).

Help “The Bang Bang Project” Fundraising campaign! Help Us Debut “The Bang Bang Project” Exhibition Tour on November 20, 2015!“The Bang Bang Project” - Enough of RACISM! Enough of POLICE BRUTALITY! Hold those who serve and protect us to their highest accountability. Paint and brushes are my weapon.  The canvas tells my story. As a Post REalist Social Justice Artist, THE BANG BANG PROJECT was born the day of Michael Brown's killer was acquitted. We want justice now. Continued abuse of power are perpetuated towards people of color every second. We need to address this issue and act now. No one should be arrested and be found dead 3 days later due to supposedly suicide on a traffic violation.  It will take all of us to change a system. This is my contribution to the dialogue of race and police brutality. Support my project. It is ours. Together we can make a difference and talk about the elephant in the room called RACISM and productively changed the system through dialogue, understanding and compassion.  If you can't contribute please share the video. Much mad love world. Cesar Conde www.cesarcondeart.com“The Bang Bang Project” introduces a multimedia production of the visual arts and live performance featuring the known international visual artist, Cesar Conde  ( www.cesarcondeart.com) in collaboration with writer and accomplished Theatre Director, Mignon McPherson Stewart.  The dynamically artistic combination will result in a historic, breathtaking exhibition tour.    The multimedia production will seduce the audience and draw these observers into a dialogue reflecting on what we have lost, what we stand to lose and how we must use our collective voices to combat this bloody cycle.  The Project Team’s goal is to develop ethical and socially responsible public affairs campaigns for the Bang Bang Project. The Bang Bang Project Partners serve as ambassadors building grassroots coalitions, disseminate project materials, act as a project liaisons, increase project visibility, and solicit community support and involvement.  The project Partners will provide access at the local and grassroots level to successfully tap into community constituencies networks of family, friends, neighbors, community leaders, faith-based organizations, co-workers, and local elected officials that are the backbone to successful community coalition building.  Through collaborative partnerships, our goal is increased visibility, social awareness, and to continue generating a national discussion on race-relations.“The Bang Bang Project” will act as a catalyst for change by creating a safe arena where discussion of highly sensitive issues can occur. “The Bang Bang Project” through the brilliance of Conde’s portraits with the captivating live performance written and direct by Mignon Stewart McPherson hopes to create the right atmosphere where open discussions occur on police brutality, racial profiling, race-relations, stigmas, and wrongful deaths.  This exhibit introduces and nurtures a safe haven for public discussion and encourages a call to action to eliminate “Dream Shots” from being a societal norm.  The Bang Bang Project will challenge ever exhibition observer to ensure all of our children live free of fear and grow to fulfill their destinies which serves to enrich everyone’s lives.EXHIBTION DEBUTThe Bang Bang Project is honored to debut the exhibition tour on November 20, 2015 at the Zhou B Art Center, the 4th Floor Exhibition Suite of the Art NXT Level Projects hosted by Sergio and Yanina Gomez.  We would greatly appreciate you pledging your financial support to help us reach our financial goal!Langston Hughes posed the question, "What happens to a dream deferred?"  Unfortunately, today we are increasing called upon to ask what happens when a dream is shot down, taken just as it is being formed.

I am humbled by the love and support that this project is gaining. More and more each day, it is touching people's lives and allowing them to contemplate in their role in society to make it more equitable and safe for our children. Many of you could not make it to the opening. A talented, young filmmaker made this video because he too believed in the project. Thank you Justin B. Suico of Golden Flair Media for contributing your time. Mad love to you.

Artist talk will happen in December during 3rd Friday. The spirit of the project is captured in the video. 

Peace,

Cesar

November 20th, 2015 remains to be one of the most fulfilled moment in my life
The passion shared by Adia Alli and Mignon McPherson Stewart in their performance was breathtaking and poignant.

The voices of The Annointed One lifted us all in another level where differences were set aside and humanity shined. In the background were 8 Bang Bang paintings communing with each other and with those present and gone.

The night was celebratory and solemn as another black man was killed
while handcuffed. Protest against it was happening in Minneapolis. The air had dread as the soon to be released videotape of an unarmed teen shoot over a dozen times will be released as ordered by a judge in Chicago.

However hope, healing and compassion filled the air as lines “I can’t breathe” was filled the air of the gallery. Hands held one another, hugged each other in the crowd as the line” Hands up! Don’t shoot!” were exclaimed and recited by the powerful artists, activist who were performing the piece.

That evening, we all became one in the gallery space. A magical evening of life and art intertwining. All colors of life breathed the same air of exuberance and hope. May art continue to thrive and that it plants a seeds of positive change so that one day, we don’t have to scream “Hands up! Don’t shoot!”.

……just a few comments from others who have been touched. (Names withheld for privacy.)

Cesar.... what an extraordinary evening you hosted. Your work and the evenings representation of it reminded me of a quote by Vincent Van Gogh...."I am seeking. I am striving. I am in it with all of my heart." Your passion, talent, and commitment to living in a world that is a better place was evident in every element of the evening. Each piece was unique and told it's own story. The eyes, in each work .....through which it is said that you can see the soul left me haunted and conflicted. To me, each piece spoke the question of why? Why did this happen? Why is this me? The theatrical performance hit just the right note..... challenging points of view... but not preachy.... making me ask myself where I stand on the continuum of judgement in a day where values and respect for human kind and one another are seemingly more conflicted than at any time in our life history. The musical performance hit exactly the right note in drawing us all together and in touching every heart in the room. It resonated a common ground where all of us regardless of point of view, ethnicity, cultural background could merge hearts and understand and value each other. I believe it was Eugene Delacroix that said "What moves men of genius, or rather what inspires their work, is not new ideas, but their obsession with the idea that what has already been said is not enough." All hail Cesar..... you are making the world a better place. Thank you for taking us on this journey with you. “


“ I watched the YouTube video for a bit and I had to stop it because I became very emotional. I appreciate Mr. Conde's work greatly and I hope that many will understand how the work that he has captured in art form is harsh reality for many.”

Please go to The Bang Bang Project facebook page for more pictures of the opening.


Much mad love world….and thank you so much,

Cesar
