Where is Saumil  now?
						Vice president, steam operations, Consolidated Edison Co.
						Updated October 12, 2012
					

By Alice Lipowicz
As the second woman ever to run a generating station for Con Ed, Saumil Shukla has learned a lot about meeting high expectations. She makes a point of regularly visiting hot, noisy control rooms, and on occasion hoisting 6-foot-long metal burner tubes into place.''I like to get feedback, so I go to the control rooms to talk to the workers,'' she says. ''Wearing hard hats and earmuffs is second nature.''A Bombay native whose family settled in Queens when she was 11 years old, Ms. Shukla excelled in science, math and physics at school. She earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from City College and a master's in industrial engineering from Polytechnic Institute.She joined Con Ed after college. Hired as a technical manager, she impressed her supervisors by consolidating several control rooms into a centralized system. She also introduced cross-training programs.Her most recent assignment, handling the quirky Hudson Avenue Generating Station in Brooklyn, is no small task. The vintage 1920s power plant requires special tending to get its four huge boilers operating efficiently. Once it gets fired up, the plant can produce enough steam to heat half of lower Manhattan on a blustery February day.''It's sometimes a challenge to stop being an engineer and let other people resolve problems that come up,'' Ms. Shukla says. ''My job is to oversee and control rather than to go fix it myself.''In her spare time, she has quieter pursuits. She relaxes by playing classical piano.
