Description



Mark AR MOD 1 4-12x40mm


Matte
Mil Dot Reticle

Several Leupold riflescopes are available with the Mil Dot reticle, which was designed to help the U.S. Marine Corps estimate distances. It’s now standard for all military branches.
Range estimating with the Mil Dot reticle: With practice, the Mil Dot system is simple to sue. Dots are spaced in one mil (milliradian) increments on the crosshair. Using the mil formula, the shooter can create a table based on the known size of the object targeted. Just look through the scope, bracket the object between dots , and refer to the table for an estimated distance to the target. Leupold scopes fitted with the Mil Dot reticle include more specific instructions on its use.

Multicoat 4

Light reflecting off lens surfaces diminishes image quality. So Leupold® engineers developed Multicoat 4®, our own proprietary lens coating system to keep image quality pristine. Multicoat 4 greatly increases the amount of all available light that reaches your eye, while at the same time, it minimizes the reflections of the sky on the outer eyepiece. You’ll never be able to control the light, but with Leupold’s Multicoat 4, you can always make the most of it.


Quantum Optical System

Leupold mechanical and optical scientists, mechanical engineers and product line managers. have dedicated their design efforts over the last year to developing the optical system for Leupold’s newest generation of riflescopes, including the VX-1, VX-2, VX-R and VX-6. The Quantum Optical System™ is a leap forward and provides a new level of optical performance for hunters and shooters. Using the rugged foundation of the legendary Vari-X series and employing state-of-the-art optical and mechanical design software and manufacturing processes, this system delivers new levels of performance in every optical category. Lead free, ecologically friendly glass compositions are used throughout—the geometry of each lens is maximized through a combination of Ze-max® design software and evaluation usingLeupold’s Zygo® Interferometer to minimize wave front error andincrease resolution. The result is razor sharp imaging across the typical light conditions experienced on any hunt—from the bright daylight of varminting to the dawn and dusk hours when big whitetails are on the move. By repositioning optical elements, employing new coatings and importantly, leaving key, time-tested mechanical aspects of the Vari-X system untouched, significant performance gains have been achieved in many other areas as well. The Quantum Optical System has greatly enhanced light transmission (up to 92% in the VX-1 system and 94% in the VX-2 system), resolution and color fidelity—all while preserving the ease of use and nearly indestructible ruggedness that has been a hallmark of Leupold riflescopes for generations.


2nd Generation Argon/Krypton Waterproofing

While we still waterproof other optics with bone-dry nitrogen – technology pioneered by Leupold® – Select models feature our exclusive, proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. Its advantages are two fold: it nearly eliminates the effects of thermal shock, and the Argon/Krypton molecules are significantly larger than nitrogen molecules, reducing the diffusion of gases sealed inside your scope even more than our proven nitrogen technology already does. We pioneered riflescope waterproofing, and now with Argon/Krypton we’re exceeding the standards we set ourselves.


Dual Use

Outstanding accuracy, legendary ruggedness, and absolute waterproof integrity. All Leupold® optics offer performance that makes them equally at home in hunting or tactical environments. Leupold Mark 4® Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are excellent choices for both long-range hunting and varminting. Likewise long-range competitive shooters and members of the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association – men and women who shoot competitively at ranges of 600 yards or more – rely on the accuracy and durability of these scopes.See overview of each product for more detailed information on hunting, shooting, and competition applications.

 Over the years our staff 
            has found many abandoned dogs in our neighborhood. Those animals we 
            couldn't find suitable homes for we adopted. They now come to work 
            and share a 30 acre farm with us.




























 
 
 




   Mark Stevens, President of Stevens Salon Products 
              has been involved with animal welfare projects for nearly 30 years.
Back in the 70's Mark was appointed by the mayor of his hometown 
              to be on the board that oversaw the operation of the local animal 
              shelter. It was there that Mr. Stevens witnessed the disturbing 
              euthanization of animals. 
Because of this Mr. Stevens has made a lifetime commitment to reducing 
              the number of unwanted dogs and cats across the country.
Until there are more homes than there are dogs and cats, there 
              is a necessity for animal shelters. We are very proud to be working 
              in conjunction with Petsmart to raise money and awareness of animal 
              shelters and the overpopulation of dogs and cats.
With the purchase of a "My Best Friend" T-shirt Stevens 
              Salon products will donate $25 to the Petsmart animal shelter foundation.
To have your favorite photo turned into a "My Best Friend" 
              T-shirt, submit the photo via JPEG format, along with contact information 
              to animals@stevenssalon.com 
 




My 
              Best Friend T-Shirt --- $29.95

At this time we are not 
              accepting donations for the t-shirts. To keep updated on this project 
              contact us.

Greg Ives-Dishonest New Hampshire Hearing Officer
Greg Ives seems like a nice guy, he’s much more patient than most bureaucrats and he remained professional during our pretended “hearing.”  He’s the type of bureaucrat who helps cause irreparable harm and injury while trying to come across as a nice guy doing what he thinks is right.   He certainly does not come […]
