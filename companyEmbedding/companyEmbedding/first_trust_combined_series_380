Risk ConsiderationsBuild America Bonds Risk. Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue meeting the requirements imposed by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, it may not receive federal cash subsidy payments which could impair the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.Insurance Risks. Certain of the securities in the trust are covered by insurance policies obtained by the issuers or underwriters of the bonds from insurance companies. There can be no assurance that any insurer will be able to satisfy its commitments in the event claims are made in the future.Municipal Bonds Risk. Municipal bonds are subject to numerous risks, including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the municipal bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal.Volatility Risk. The value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers.
Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trust's estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit.  Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust.  Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust.  Returns and prices will fluctuate.  Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.Some of the information may have been obtained from third parties, including ratings from credit ratings agencies such as Standard 
& Poor's.  Reproduction and distribution of third party content in any form is prohibited except with the prior written permission of the related third party.  Third 
party content providers do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or availability of any information, including ratings, and are not responsible for 
any errors or omissions (negligent or otherwise), regardless of the cause, or for the results obtained from the use of such content.  THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS GIVE 
NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE.  THIRD PARTY CONTENT 
PROVIDERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, COMPESATORY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, COSTS, EXPENSES, LEGAL FEES, OR 
LOSSES (INCLUDING LOST INCOME OR PROFITS AND OPPORTUNITY COSTS) IN CONNECTION WITH ANY USE OF THEIR CONTENT, INCLUDING RATINGS.  Credit ratings are statements of opinions 
and are not statements of fact or recommendations to purchase, hold or sell securities.  They do not address the suitability of securities or the suitability of securities 
for investment purposes, and should not be relied on as investment advice. Please see the prospectus for a full description of the bond ratings.

You should carefully consider the trust's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses before investing. Contact your financial advisor or call First Trust Portfolios, L.P. at 1.800.621.1675 to request a prospectus, which contains this and other information about the trust. Read it carefully before you invest.

This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
