Maker



with Desert Ironwood & India Stag Handle

Keith has been providing us with a narrow tang hunting knife with a modified clip point blade for the past couple of years. Because of requests from customers, we have asked him to also make a drop point hunter for us. Keith makes mostly full tang knives with applied handle scales, and makes the narrow tang knives mostly for us. The narrow tang allows more variety in the handle material and in the arrangement of that material. Often referred to as Stick Tang Construction, because the handle material is arranged on a narrow extension of the blade which extends through the butt of the handle, this is the way knives were built by Webster Marble, Bill Scagel, Harry Morseth and, yes, by Randall Knives.
For years, our most popular hunting knives were the Morseth® knives, all of which were built with the narrow tang in our shop in Springdale, Arkansas. Today, most knifemakers and most knife factories have moved away from the narrow tang, favoring the full tang with handle scales for ease of construction. Keith, a Northwest Arkansas knifemaker with lots of knifemaking credentials, probably learned the craft of narrow tang construction in Bob Dozier's shop making the Morseth® knives.
While Keith is not limiting this model with stag and desert ironwood to a specific number, it will be limited by the availability of the stag and what he can produce. The 4-3/8" drop point blade measures 1" wide at it widest point, and 3/16" thick. The steel is D2 at 60-61 Rc. and the hilt is stainless steel. Measures 8-3/8" overall and weighs 7.6 oz. The brown leather pouch style sheath is handmade by Keith and his wife Linda.

Keith Murr Knives
Keith Murr is an knifemaker residing in Northwest Arkansas. He has been making knives since 1987. There are lots of knifemakers making handmade knives in their own shop, some just set up in their garage or a small outbuilding, and some with fine well equipped shops. Those who are making knives at the quality level demanded by our customers is much smaller. Finding makers who are producing the quality and can supply enough pieces for us to include in an A. G. Russell™ catalog is rare.

The Effects of Product Involvement and Task Definition on Anticipated  Consumer Effort



Keith Clarke, (student), University of IllinoisRussell W. Belk, University of Illinois

ABSTRACT -     Two major determinants of the fervor and diligence with which a consumer  prepares to make a purchase are thought to be the degree of involvement with the item to  be purchased and the degree of involvement in the situation in which the purchasing  occurs. This paper reports an experiment to assess the manner in which inherent product  involvement and situational task importance affect anticipated consumer purchase effort.  Both factors were found to independently increase estimations of purchase effort, but the  effect of task importance was negligible in the case of high involvement products. This  finding is interpreted as a ceiling effect on overall involvement level.

 Advances in Consumer Research Volume 6, 1979       Pages 313-318 THE EFFECTS OF PRODUCT INVOLVEMENT AND TASK DEFINITION ON ANTICIPATED  CONSUMER EFFORT Keith Clarke (student), University of Illinois Russell W. Belk, University of Illinois ABSTRACT -  Two major determinants of the fervor and diligence with which a consumer  prepares to make a purchase are thought to be the degree of involvement with the item to  be purchased and the degree of involvement in the situation in which the purchasing  occurs. This paper reports an experiment to assess the manner in which inherent product  involvement and situational task importance affect anticipated consumer purchase effort.  Both factors were found to independently increase estimations of purchase effort, but the  effect of task importance was negligible in the case of high involvement products. This  finding is interpreted as a ceiling effect on overall involvement level. The concept of consumer purchasing effort has received relatively little  attention in consumer research. Cardozo and Bramel (1969) treated the expenditure of  effort in consumer decision-making as a form of behavioral commitment to the purchase. In  this view, greater effort in a consumer purchase decision increases the perceived  importance of the purchase decision and thereby increases the potential for post-purchase  cognitive dissonance. The dissonance created by expending an amount of effort which is not  commensurate with the degree of satisfaction the product is able to provide, may then be  reduced through an inflated post-purchase evaluation of the chosen product. Cardozo (1965)  and Woodside (1972) found support for this hypothesis in experiments manipulating the  amount of effort required in consumers' prescribed information search activities. However,  in much of consumers' normal purchasing activities the search task is much less structured  and the relationship between decision importance and purchasing effort may be in the  opposite direction from the one set up in these studies. That is, rather than greater  search effort causing consumers to perceive a purchase as being more important, greater  purchase importance should cause consumers to expend more search effort. This was the  primary hypothesis motivating the present research. PRODUCT INVOLVEMENT AND TASK INVOLVEMENT AS DETERMINANTS OF DECISION  IMPORTANCE Two separate aspects of the importance of a purchase decision are the  amount of product involvement and the nature of the task definition involved in the  purchase. Product involvement, as used here, is purchase item-specific but not purchase  situation-specific. [Howard and Sheth (1969) used the term "importance of  purchase," Lastovicka (1976) used the term "issue involvement,'' and Rothchild  (1977) used the term "enduring involvement" to refer to this type of  involvement.] Thus, for a given individual, a set of products and services might he  arrayed in terms of their inherent involvement. While there are individual differences in  levels of involvement with a given product, with a relatively homogeneous population the  rank orders of involvement with an array of products are expected to be reasonably  constant. Hupfer and Gardner's (1971) measures of product involvement among college  students support this expectation, with certain products such as automobiles being almost  uniformly more involving than other products such as facial tissues. Ratchford and  Andreasen (1974) reached similar conclusions in their examination of the perceived  importance of decisions to purchase various services by new residents to a community. Howard and Sheth (1969, p. 73) predicted that greater search effort will  be expended for high importance products. Consistent with this hypothesis, Katona and  Mueller (1954) found strong differences in consumer decision effort  ("deliberation") between products of such apparently differential involvement as  sports shirts (low) versus major appliances (high). However, it is not clear that product  involvement was the primary difference between these products, and various authors (e.g.  Sherif and Cantril, 1947) have suggested that clothing is highly involving. It is  therefore necessary to test any operationalization of product involvement and to avoid  generalizing to dissimilar populations. A second determinant of decision importance is task involvement. Belk  (1975) suggested that task-defining features of a consumer purchase situation arise from  goals relating to information gathering or product selection, and from the usage  situations envisioned for products which are relevant to these goals. In other words, the  task is defined by the consumer's intentions at a particular time and place. The task may  be highly involving either because it entails important immediate goals (e.g., "find  a coat which is the least expensive brown wool coat in town"), or because the  intended usage situation involves important goals (e.g. "find a dress to wear to the  prom"). Although task definitions for purchase situations may also differ in other  respects such as their difficulty, specificity, and complexity, the present study is  concerned only with task involvement. Some support for the hypothesized relationship between task importance and  search effort is found in a study by Gr°nhaug (1972). Gr°nhaug compared the information  search activities of recent buyers of tableware who bought the product either as a gift  (higher task involvement) or for personal use (lower task involvement). Those who had  purchased the tableware as a gift were found to have considered more alternatives, visited  more shops, sought more advice from both dealers and others, and studied more brochures.  Based on these results and prior studies of the task involvement levels of gift-giving  (e.g. Belk, forthcoming), the present study employs the gift/personal use dichotomy to  manipulate task involvement. INVOLVEMENT, AROUSAL, AND EFFORT A key concept integrating product involvement and task involvement as well  as linking them to effort expenditure, is arousal. In an approximate sense, arousal may be  seen as the level of energy released to deal with a person's present situation. While  product and task involvement are not the only determinants of arousal, in a focused  activity like product choice and purchasing they are generally dominant. The general  expectation then is that with greater levels of arousal created by higher product  involvement, task involvement, or both, the amount of effort devoted to information search  and processing increases. It should be noted, however, that most theorists dealing with  arousal do not postulate a straight linear relationship between level of arousal and level  of efficient effort expenditure. For instance, based on the work of Hebb (1966), Berlyne  (1967), and others, Hansen (1972) predicts the greatest amount of information search and  deliberation at very low and moderately high levels of arousal, and the lowest amount of  effort expenditure on these activities at medium levels of arousal. Despite the  theoretical and empirical support for the non-linear relationship between arousal and  effort expenditure, the series of experiments conducted by Hansen (1972) supports the view  that most consumer purchase activities fall within the range of arousal which avoids the  extremes at which arousal may no longer be positively associated with effort. Similarly it  is assumed that the levels of involvement created by the present study's product and task  involvement conditions are such that there is a direct although not necessarily linear  relationship between arousal and consumer purchase effort expenditure. Consumer purchase effort in response to arousal level may be manifested in  several different ways. Effort is spent when the consumer internally recalls and processes  information as well as when there are more overt signs of information acquisition. As  Newman (1977) points out, external information search can also take on a number of forms  and appearances. The most frequently used measure of external consumer search is the  number of retail stores visited prior to purchase, and this is the one of the measures  adopted for the current study. Nearly all measures of external information search involve  active deliberate information search, although recent extensions of the time budget diary  method by Venkatesan and Arndt (forthcoming) obtain some measures of passive  non-deliberate information acquisition. Because the present study focuses on anticipated  effort expenditure, its measures concern deliberate information search. A second measure  of consumer effort expenditure used in the current study is deliberation time exclusive of  travel time. By excluding travel time the measure ignores locational factors idiosyncratic  to the data collection city, and provides a measure of largely internal search and  processing activity efforts. The price a consumer expects to pay for a product constitutes  a third type of measure in this study. Although price is not a reflection of effort  expenditure directly, since effort must usually be expended for the consumer to obtain  money, spending more money is an indirect expenditure of effort. HYPOTHESES The three basic measures of effort expenditure just noted are hypothesized  to be related to the two types of involvement in the following ways:   1. More stores will be shopped, more time will be spent, and more money      will be spent under high task involvement conditions than under low task involvement      conditions. 2. More stores will be shopped, more time will be spent, and more money      will be spent for high involvement products than for low involvement products. 3. The effects of task involvement and product involvement will be      additive with no interaction.   While each of the hypothesized effects in the first two hypotheses have  been discussed, there is an alternative to hypothesizing that all three types of  effort expenditure will increase with involvement. The alternative is to consider the  three types of effort as substitutes, so that an increase in one type of effort can lead  to a reduction in the others. For instance, a consumer might rely on a higher priced  product as an assurance of satisfaction and thereby reduce the necessity of additional  information search. However, considering that the source of consumer arousal is  involvement with the product or task, it seems more reasonable that the consumer would be  willing to spend more money and more information search effort in order to assure a  more satisfactory purchase. Furthermore, in line with the Cardozo (1965) findings, the  expenditure of one type of effort may itself increase the overall levels of purchase  involvement and arousal which would further increase the other types of effort  expenditure. The third hypothesis assumes that regardless of the level of inherent product  involvement, giving the product as a gift (high task involvement) increases the overall  level of arousal and causes more effort to be expended. METHOD A two by four factorial design was used. Task involvement was manipulated  by informing subjects that the product was to be purchased for personal use or else as a  gift for a good friend. Product involvement was operationalized by the use of four  products. Two of the products (bubble bath and a blanket) were chosen to represent low  involvement and two (jeans and a record album) were chosen to represent high involvement  products. These choices were based on a series of direct and indirect measures of  involvement with various products conducted by Lastovicka (1976) and in pretests conducted  by the authors on the same general subject pool as the current study. In the pretest conducted by the authors, subjects also provided estimates  of a low, a medium, and a high level for each of the three dependent measures. That is,  subjects in the pretest estimated a low, medium, and high number of stores to visit, a  low, medium and high amount of non-travel time to spend in deciding, and a low, medium,  and high amount of money to spend for each of the products. These measures were obtained  for each product without reference to the task situation. The mean of the "medium  amount" was used as the central point in a scale measuring the amount of a type of  effort the experimental subjects would be willing to expend in selecting each product. The  points on either side of these central points for each scale were selected by taking the  median of the high and low amounts for each product. Medians were used so as not to choose  points skewed by any extremely high or low values given in the pretest. On each scale, two  additional points were added by including the categories "less than (the low  amount)" and "higher than (the high amount)". Through the use of these  scales it was possible to make comparisons of the objective ("real choice")  levels of effort expenditure across the products, even though the base levels of these  effort expenditures differed across the products. In an effort to measure subjective  ("relative choice") levels of effort expenditures, three additional questions  were employed measuring effort expenditure on seven-point scales labeled from "very  little" or "very few" to "very much" or "very many".  The same results were expected from measures of both subjective and objective effort  expenditures. Subjects were 56 undergraduate female students. They were randomly  assigned to two treatment conditions subject to the constraints that each receive both  task conditions but not receive the same product. It was felt that having each subject  engage a different task and a different product would minimize the problem of  repeated measures effects. To test for this, the data were first analyzed as a two by four  by two design with the third factor being whether the responses were to the first  product/task or the second product/task. There were no significant main effects or  interaction effects involving this third factor so it was felt that there had been no  sensitization problem and the data were collapsed into the two by four design. RESULTS The results of the study are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. The main  effect for task involvement was significant for all six dependent measures, with effort  expenditures for gifts reported as higher than expenditures for products for personal use.  The second hypothesis was also generally supported, with all relative choice effort  measures significant but with numbers of stores the only significant real choice measure.  At least on the perceived effort scales then, the amount of effort was greater for the  high involvement products. TABLE 1 ANOVA SUMMARY (F LEVELS) FIGURE 1 CELL MEANS OF DEPENDENT VARIABLES The third hypothesis, that there would be no interaction effect between  task involvement and product involvement, however, must be rejected. For all of the real  choice measures and for the relative choice measure for time expenditure, the interaction  effect is significant. As may be seen in the plots of cell means and in the simple main  effects tests, the effect of task involvement was to increase the amount of anticipated  effort for the low involvement products, but not for the high involvement products (with  the partial exception of the amount of money and number of stores for the record album). DISCUSSION The one surprising finding is the interaction effect between inherent  product involvement and task involvement. Although the stipulation that a product is being  selected as a gift generally increases the reported amount of consumer effort expenditure,  this is not the case for the high involvement products. The most plausible explanation is  that there is a ceiling effect on the overall amount of involvement. For selection of a  product like jeans, involvement is already as high as it can normally get and the gift  conditions can raise this level no higher. On the other hand, gift-giving is able to  transform an otherwise low involvement purchase like bubble bath into an important  decision. However, the possible existence of a ceiling effect on involvement need not mean  that there is a comparable ceiling effect on the levels of arousal corresponding to this  involvement. It is reasonably clear that even giving high involvement products like jeans  or records as a gift is still not sufficient to create arousal at the extremely high  levels for which decreased purchase effort is predicted. Another way to view the combined effects of the levels of product  involvement and task involvement studied, is in terms of product relevance to the  purchaser's self concept. Compared to the two low involvement products (bubble bath and  blankets) the two high involvement products (record albums and jeans) are relatively  visible to others and also more likely to be construed as matters of "taste".  However, as has been noted by Belk (1976), normally non-visible products tend to become  visible symbolic communications when they are given as gifts. A part of this symbolic  communication involves a message about the recipient (i.e. this is a gift that suits you),  and a part of the communication involves a message about the giver (i.e. this is a gift  that reflects my tastes). Although the addition of the message about the recipient might  seem to justify greater effort expenditure for the inherently high involvement products,  the fact that the normal level of effort expenditure for these products is already high  enough to consider the symbolic aspects of the purchase, may mitigate this effect. There are some obvious cautions which need to be applied to interpreting  and generalizing these results. Since these are reports of anticipated effort, they are  subject to social desirability and other biases and may not reflect the actual amount of  effort devoted to purchases. It is, however, encouraging to note that Ryans (1977) found  greater amounts of information search time were expended when small appliances were chosen  as gifts for people outside of the giver's household than when they were chosen for  personal use. Nevertheless, the theoretical interpretations of these effects as due solely  to task involvement are tentative given the singular manipulation of this variable. The  same is true of the product involvement variable since the products employed also differ  in other ways such as their visibility. Also, although the products selected were relevant  and differentially involving for the college female sample, they may not be so for others. CONCLUSION It appears that the reason for purchasing an item as well as the inherent  involvement with the item create differences in the amount of effort a consumer is willing  to exert in purchasing the product. It would therefore be a mistake to assume that  personally uninvolving products are purchased with little effort devoted to securing and  processing information or otherwise attempting to optimize purchase selection. In fact,  during peak holiday gift-giving periods high task involvement and attendant effort may  predominate the selection of normally uninvolving products. As suggested by other research  (e.g., Hupfer and Gardner, 1971) as well as the present research, it would also be a  mistake to assume that higher price is necessarily related to higher involvement and  higher purchase effort. Even though blankets are generally mere expensive than Jeans,  Jeans are higher involvement products to which greater amounts of purchase effort are  devoted. Among the areas for future research suggested by this study are  investigations of purchase situation characteristics, other than personal/gift use, which  affect the level of task involvement and purchase effort. It is also of interest to know  whether different bases for product involvement (e.g. social relevance, financial  relevance, hedonic relevance) are all able to create greater purchase effort expenditure.  It will also be necessary to establish these effects in actual as well as in anticipated  purchase effort expenditures. And the particular types of purchase effort expenditure  which are favored in different types of high involvement purchase decisions might be  considered. Finally, it would be useful to know whether increases in consumer purchase  effort in response to greater purchase involvement, have the same effects on postpurchase  processes such as dissonance reduction as when the effort increase is necessitated by  unforeseen purchase conditions.
