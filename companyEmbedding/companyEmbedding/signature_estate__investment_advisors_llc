A great learning environment and good place to stop and get paid to achieve designations and credentials.ConsThe entire focus of the firm is the enhancement of the personal wealth and status of the upper management instead of the firm as a whole,and surprisingly little attention is given to the success of the client. Zero chance of advancement and employees are viewed as a commodity and easily replaceable, so no value is given to superlative work beyond what it will ultimately produce for the management.Advice to ManagementIf the only product you want to produce is personal gain, then you should not change anything because you're obviously doing a great job. However, if you want to build a firm that survives you and is a trusted financial institution, then some attentíon must be given to employees and their path to success. Empty promises of advancement and token compensation will only perpetuate your revolving door of marginally disgruntled staff. Once senior producers begin to retire your firm will dissolve.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Signature Estate & Investment Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Signature Estate & Investment 2015-09-13 07:10 PDT Aug 19, 2014 Helpful (2)"Unstructured firm, no upward mobility.

LOS ANGELES, July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Signature Estate and Investment Advisors, LLC (SEIA), a full service wealth management firm headquartered in Southern California, is pleased to announce it has been named to the 2017 Financial Times 300 Top Registered Investment Advisers list. The prestigious ranking recognizes top independent RIA firms from across the U.S.  








This is the fourth annual FT 300 list, which is produced independently by the Financial Times in collaboration with Ignites Research, a subsidiary of the publication that provides business intelligence on the investment management industry. 
"We're excited to join our peers on a list that represents the highest tier of the wealth management community," said SEIA President and CEO Brian D. Holmes. "Perhaps more important than any accolade is our determination to continue raising standards, connecting with our clients by analyzing their entire financial picture, and achieving their subsequent goals. We've made great strides and we look forward to building on them." 
RIA firms applied for consideration having met a specific set of criteria. Applicants were then graded on six factors: assets under management (AUM); AUM growth rate; years in existence; advanced industry credentials of the firm's advisers; online accessibility; and compliance records. There are no fees or other considerations required of RIAs that apply for the FT 300.
The FT 300 represents an impressive cohort of elite RIA firms, as the "average" practice in this year's list has been in existence for 24 years and manages $2.7 billion in assets. The FT 300 Top RIAs hail from 37 states and Washington, D.C.
"We are humbled to be named to the 2017 Financial Times Top 300 List," Holmes continued. "Our business is structured around a commitment to our clients' holistic financial future, and we're honored to see that philosophy recognized."
The FT 300 is one in series of rankings of top advisers by the Financial Times, including the FT 401 (DC retirement plan advisers) and the FT 400 (broker-dealer advisers).

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
