Jerome Simon, Lonestar's founder, said in a letter sent to investors that the fund's failure to get its portfolio consistently right had weighed on its performance, particularly in recent months. Simon called the closure of the fund a "bittersweet moment," and said its performance in October was "challenging due to intense volatility during the month." The letter, made available to Reuters, was dated Nov. 10. Lonestar's main fund was down 2.4 percent for the year until the end of October.     The fund intends to distribute a significant portion of its limited partners capital account by the end of the year, with further distributions in the first half of 2015. It aims to return all its capital by June 30, 2015. News of the fund's shutdown was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said the final straw came late in October when the Bank of Japan unexpectedly eased its monetary policy. A spokesperson for Lonestar declined to comment. Simon will manage his own money from a personal office once the shutdown is complete in mid-2015, the Journal said.

Hedge Fund Lonestar Capital to Shut Down – Sources

Rob Copeland was first to report that hedge-fund firm Lonestar Capital Management LLC plans to close it’s doors and return most of its $1 billion portfolio to investors by mid-2015, according sources. The firm’s main fund was down more than 2% this year through the end of October. Founder Jerome Simon plans to manage his own family office.

2:41 PM EST: Hedge Fund Lonestar Capital to Shut Down
By Rob Copeland
The San Francisco hedge-fund firm Lonestar Capital Management LLC will shut down in one of the larger hedge-fund liquidations this year, according to people familiar with the firm.
Based in San Francisco, Lonestar manages about $1 billion, including funds from deep-pocketed investors like David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital Inc., the people said.
In a letter to investors, founder Jerome Simon called it a “bittersweet moment” and said he was disappointed that recently he could not “claim the very highest ground of perennial outperformance,” according to a person with knowledge of the letter. Its main fund was down more than 2% this year through the end of October, compared with a 1.6% gain for its peer event-driven hedge funds tracked by HFR Inc.
Mr. Simon will manage his own fortune in a so-called family office once the shutdown is complete, in mid 2015.

Lonestar Capital Management LLC


                  Lonestar Capital Management's investment strategy is based on rejection of the efficient market hypothesis. The firm seeks to exploit material mispricing among investments by knowing more than the market does about their targeted investment opportunities. Lonestar invests in debt and equity securities based on a value-oriented approach. Investment targets include hard-asset industrial and commodity-based businesses, and include bankruptcy and turnaround situations, energy and transportation companies, agricultural concerns and real estate securities. The firm may invest in securities of any kind, including, but not limited to, illiquid securities, private claims of distressed companies, and  investments based on their macroeconomic analysis, which are typically made through buying or selling sovereign debt or credit default swaps, interest rate swaps or other currency or commodity related instruments. Evaluation of a target company's balance sheet and cash flow statement is of prime consideration in developing the investment thesis. Lonestar continually engages in a search for secular, industry-wide trends so that multiple investments can be made along a common theme. Lonestar invests on both the long and short sides of the market. Particular emphasis is placed on companies with complicated balance sheets that may result in multiple as well as arbitraged investment positions within a single company's capital structure. The firm also seeks out intra-industry hedged positions when material mispricing is observed.
