About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Home

Latest news
READ FULL BIO
 













David Oestreicher II
Areas of Practice: The Oestreicher law firm
The New Orleans law office of David Oestreicher, handles many types of cases for our clients, and their families, with a particular focus on personal injury.
We also handle many cases in areas such as product liability, construction defects, business litigation and contracts, medical malpractice and criminal defense.
For more than 30 years, my firm’s caseload has spanned a diverse range of litigation. Read below for more information on these areas of practice.
Personal Injury
A personal injury claim, whether it involves a car or truck, a consumer product, or medical error, means any incident where a person has been injured or killed because someone or something (such as a business) was negligent. In cases where the injury results in death, this is known as “wrongful death.”
Product Liability
Manufacturers, distributors, suppliers and retailers are responsible for harm caused by defective products they put into the marketplace. The focus must be on “safety first”, rather than on a “bottom line” mindset that puts profits before people. David Oestreicher can help you pursue a product liability claim against local, regional or even national manufacturers in product liability cases.
Business litigation & Contracts
Many clients call on Oestreicher Law as legal disputes arise in the course of their business dealings. We work with individuals and businesses to settle disputes and perform business transactions.
There are many laws and codes protecting individuals and businesses against unjust breaches of contracts. Navigating the legalities of contract language, and keeping abreast of applicable court decisions and statutes, is important in order to achieve the maximum compensation in contract disputes.
If you have questions regarding business law or business litigation, schedule a case evaluation. I have resolved numerous issues and disputes involving partnerships, contracts, landlord / tenant issues, residential and commercial leases, fraud, and trade secret violations.
Automotive & truck liability
If you need a reputable source to discuss auto liability issues, please contact the law firm of David Oestreicher.
Defective automobiles, trucks and SUV’s can lead to, or be the cause of, serious injuries. David Oestreicher represents people who are injured by defective auto products. If you think you were injured in an automobile accident, and think you have a case due to defective automobile products such as: airbags, brakes, seatbelts, tires or other components of the vehicles involved in the accident, give us a call.
Medical malpractice
Medical malpractice is a professional negligence by act or omission by a health care provider. In malpractice cases, it is necessary to establish that treatment provided falls below the accepted standard of practice, Malpractive can also be applied in cases where the act or omission results in injury or death to a patient.
Medical professionals may obtain professional liability insurances to offset the risk and costs of lawsuits based on medical malpractice. If you think you have a medical malpractice claim, call David Oestreicher to schedule an evaluation.
Property tax resolution — Louisiana Tax Commission
David Oestreicher represents clients in disputes involving Louisiana tax issues. Our firm routinely prepares protest letters concerning state and local tax assessments, and appears at hearings with the tax jurisdictions to resolve disputes. If you have any questions regarding tax disputes in Louisiana, Call David Oestreicher.
D.W.I. – Driving While Intoxicated
David Oestreicher has been successfully representing persons charged with drunk driving, OUI, DUI and DWI, for more than 20 years. He is an experienced and accomplished drunk driving attorney, who deals with matters including, intoxication, motor vehicle operation, accidents, citations, impairment, roadblocks, sobriety checkpoints, license suspensions, blood tests, breath tests, blood alcohol content and field sobriety tests.
Criminal Defense
David Oestreicher has successfully defended clients statewide on criminal matters. As a retired former reserve police officer in the New Orleans Police Department, he has a unique perspective on all aspects of criminal law. His extensive knowledge of police investigative techniques and practices allows him to aggressively defend your case from the outset.
