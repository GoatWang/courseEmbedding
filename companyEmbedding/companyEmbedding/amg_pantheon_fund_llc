U.S. public pensions have long been investing in private equity and most have steadily increased their target allocations over time.
The average public fund now targets an 8.5% allocation2, but even greater targets are common among large, well-known public pensions and endowments.
Large endowments such as Harvard, Stanford and Yale have invested in private equity for decades, with current target allocations of 18%, 23% and 31%, respectively3.

Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. For this and other information, please call 800.835.3879 or download a free prospectus. Read it carefully before investing or sending money.
This information is not an offer to sell securities issued by AMG Pantheon Fund, LLC (the "Fund"). Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.
Everyone cannot invest like an institution. Institutions are professional money managers who have unique access and the ability to perform extensive due diligence on managers. Many investors' experience, financial means, objectives, risk tolerance, and time frame will differ from that of institutions, and they may not be able to access the same investment opportunities as institutions. These factors should be taken into consideration when creating an allocation to alternatives. The above should not be construed as investment advice. Diversification does not ensure profit nor protect against loss.
All investors in the Fund must be "Accredited Investors," as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company designed for long-term investors and not as a trading vehicle. The Fund has limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate potential performance. 
The Fund differs from open-end investment companies in that investors do not have the right to redeem their units on a daily basis. Instead, repurchases of units are subject to the approval of the Fund's Board of Directors. The Fund's units represent illiquid securities of an unlisted closed-end fund, are not listed on any securities exchange or traded in any other market, and are subject to substantial limitations on transferability. THE FUND DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT TO REPURCHASE ANY OF ITS UNITS UNTIL AT LEAST SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, AND EVEN AFTER SUCH DATE, LIQUIDITY IN ANY GIVEN QUARTER IS NOT GUARANTEED. YOU SHOULD NOT INVEST IN THE FUND IF YOU NEED A LIQUID INVESTMENT. 
The Fund will invest substantially all of its assets in AMG Pantheon Master Fund, LLC (the "Master Fund"). This investment structure is commonly referred to as a "master-feeder" fund arrangement. The investment advisor of the Fund and the Master Fund is Pantheon Ventures (US) LP (the "Advisor"). The Master Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may be invested in a relatively small number of underlying funds or portfolio companies, which subjects the Master Fund, and therefore the Fund, to greater risk and volatility than if the Master Fund's assets had been invested in a broader range of issuers. No assurance can be given that the Master Fund's investment program will be successful. An investment in the Fund should be viewed only as part of an overall investment program.
An investment in the Fund is speculative and involves substantial risks. It is possible that investors may lose some or all of their investment. In general, alternative investments such as private equity or infrastructure involve a high degree of risk, including potential loss of principal invested. These investments can be highly illiquid, charge higher fees than other investments, and typically do not grow at an even rate of return and may decline in value. In addition, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
In addition to all of the risks inherent in alternative investments, an investment in the Fund involves specific risks associated with private equity investing. Underlying funds and many of the securities held by underlying funds may be difficult to value and will be priced in the absence of readily available market quotations, based on determinations of fair value, which may prove to be inaccurate. Fund investors will bear asset-based fees and expenses at the Fund and Master Fund levels, and will also indirectly bear fees, expenses and performance-based compensation of the underlying funds. Underlying funds will not be registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), and the Master Fund's investments in underlying funds will not benefit from the protections of the 1940 Act. The value of the Master Fund's investments in underlying funds will also fluctuate and may decline. 
The Fund's investment portfolio through the Master Fund will consist of primary and secondary investments in private equity funds that hold securities issued primarily by privately held companies ("Investment Funds"), co-investments, ETFs, cash and cash-equivalents. Many of such investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses.
Subject to the limitations and restrictions of the 1940 Act, the Master Fund may use derivative transactions, primarily equity options and swaps, for hedging purposes. Options and swaps transactions present risks arising from the use of leverage (which increases the magnitude of losses), volatility, the possibility of default by a counterparty, and illiquidity. Use of options and swaps transactions for hedging purposes by the Master Fund could present significant risks, including the risk of losses in excess of the amounts invested.
Additionally, the Master Fund may invest in ETFs. The risk of ETFs designed to track equity indexes may include passive strategy risk (the ETF may hold constituent securities of an index regardless of the current or projected performance of a specific security or a particular industry, market sector, country, or currency, which could cause returns to be lower or higher than if an active strategy were used), non-correlation risk (the ETF's return may not match the returns of the relevant index), equity securities risk (the value of equity securities will rise and fall in response to the activities of the company that issued them, general market conditions, and/or economic conditions), market trading risks (the ETF faces market trading risks, including losses from trading in secondary markets and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the ETF), and concentration risk (to the extent the ETF or underlying index's portfolio is concentrated in the securities of a particular geographic or market segment, the ETF may be adversely affected by the performance of that particular geographic or market segment, may be subject to increased price volatility, and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political, or regulatory occurrences affected by that particular geographic or market segment).
The Master Fund may invest, including for defensive purposes, directly and indirectly, some or all of its assets in high quality fixed-income securities, money market instruments and money market mutual funds, or hold cash or cash equivalents in such amounts as the Advisor or general partner, manager or equivalent of the underlying Investment Fund (the "Investment Fund manager(s)") deem appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, the Master Fund or an Investment Fund may invest in these instruments pending allocation of its assets, and the Master Fund will seek to retain cash or cash equivalents in sufficient amounts to satisfy capital calls from Investment Funds. Money market instruments are generally high quality, short-term fixed-income obligations, which typically have remaining maturities of one year or less and may include U.S. Government securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances issued by domestic branches of U.S. banks that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and repurchase agreements. The performance of these investments may be adversely affected by tax, legal, legislative, regulatory, credit, political or government changes, interest rate increases and the financial conditions of issuers, which may pose credit risks that result in issuer default.
Any statements regarding market events, future events or other similar statements constitute only subjective views, are based upon expectations or beliefs, should not be relied on, are subject to change due to a variety of factors, including fluctuating market conditions, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, many of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond the Fund's control. Future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying these statements. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that these statements are now or will prove to be accurate or complete in any way. No representation is made that the Fund's or the Master Fund's investment process or investment objectives will be or are likely to be successful or achieved.
Investment products are not FDIC insured, are not bank guaranteed and may lose value.
INDEX DESCRIPTIONS
Unlike the Fund, indices are unmanaged, are not available for investment, and do not incur expenses.
The S&P 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The S&P 500 Index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major indices. The S&P 500 Index is proprietary data of Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.
The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is an index of the U.S. investment-grade fixed-rate bond market, including both government and corporate bonds.
The Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Index measures U.S. publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts.
The Cambridge Associates U.S. Private Equity Index is based on data compiled from 970 U.S. private equity funds (buyout, growth equity, private equity, energy and mezzanine funds), including fully liquidated partnerships, formed between 1986 and 2010. The Cambridge Associates U.S. Private Equity Index has limitations (some of which are typical to other widely used indices) and cannot be used to predict performance of the Fund. These limitations include survivorship bias (the returns of the index may not be representative of all private equity funds in the universe because of the tendency of lower performing funds to leave the index); heterogeneity (not all private equity are alike or comparable to one another, and the index may not accurately reflect the performance of a described style); and limited data (many funds do not report to indices, and the index may omit funds, the inclusion of which might significantly affect the performance shown).
AMG Distributors, Inc., a member of FINRA/SIPC, is the distributor for the Fund.

Diversification does not ensure profit or protect against loss in a positive or declining market.

AMG Funds and Pantheon Deliver Private Equity Fund Access for Retail Investors




29 October 2015






AMG Funds, the U.S. retail distribution arm of the global asset management company, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE: AMG), and Pantheon, a leading global private equity fund investor, today announced the 1933 Act registration of the AMG Pantheon Fund (the “Fund”). This registration makes the Fund more widely available to accredited investors, who now have access to a diversified, institutional-caliber portfolio of private equity through a single investment. The Fund is a multi-manager vehicle that seeks diversification across all key private equity categories—manager, stage, vintage, industry and geography—by targeting opportunities across the private equity universe. Compared with traditional private equity offerings, the Fund features a low minimum investment of $25,000 and simple 1099 tax reporting.
“With consistently superior long-term returns relative to public market assets, private equity has long been a top-performing asset class, to which investors have become increasingly interested in gaining efficient access in order to diversify their portfolios,” said Jeffrey Cerutti, CEO of AMG Funds. “With a long, successful track record spanning over three decades, our Affiliate, Pantheon, is highly respected in private equity investing and an exceptional manager to have at the helm of this Fund.  AMG Funds is very pleased to partner with Pantheon in offering an access point for individual investors to participate in this important asset class through this innovative product.”1

“Through the AMG Pantheon Fund, our firm can deploy its investment expertise to deliver a single-allocation private equity vehicle designed for individual investors,” said Kevin Albert, Managing Director at Pantheon. “The Fund provides accredited investors the opportunity to invest alongside our institutional clients, while introducing simplified tax reporting and significantly lower investment minimums than are typical in traditional private equity fund structures.”
The Fund is registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. For more information on the Fund, please visit www.amgfunds.com/pantheon.

The average public fund now targets an 8.5% allocation2, but even greater targets are common among large, well-known public pensions and endowments.

Click a fund name to view that fund's detailed performance information.
The performance shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. From time to time the advisor has waived fees or reimbursed expenses, which may have resulted in higher returns. The listed returns and yields on the Fund are net of expenses. Performance shown does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, or redemption fees, which would have reduced the performance.
Morningstar rating as of June 30, 2017. 
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the share class indicated only (see ticker); other share classes may have different performance characteristics. The Ranking may reflect the waiver of all or a portion of the fund's fees. Without such waiver, the Rankings may have been lower. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

I.
THE PROPOSAL  AMG Pantheon Private Equity Fund, LLC (the �Feeder Fund�), AMG
Pantheon Private Equity Master Fund, LLC (the �Master Fund,� together with the Feeder Fund, the �Funds�), Pantheon Ventures (US) LP (the �Adviser�) and AMG Distributors, Inc. (the �Placement Agent,� together
with the Feeder Fund, the Master Fund and the Adviser, the �Applicants�) hereby amend and restate their application to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �Commission�) for an order (i)�pursuant to Section�6(c)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�), granting exemptions from Sections 18(c) and 18(i) of the 1940 Act, and (ii)�pursuant to Section�17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder, to permit the
Feeder Fund to offer investors multiple classes of units of beneficial interest (�Units�)1 with varying sales loads and asset-based distribution and/or service fees, as described more
fully in
 � 1 As used in this Application, �Units� includes any other equivalent designation of a proportionate ownership interest of the Feeder Fund (or any other registered closed-end management
investment company relying on the requested order). 
� 2



Table of Contents

this application (as amended and restated, the �Application�). The Applicants request that the order also apply to any other registered closed-end management investment company that
conducts a continuous offering of its units, existing now or in the future, for which the Adviser or the Placement Agent or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or the Placement Agent acts as investment
adviser or principal underwriter, and which provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Units through tender offers conducted in compliance with Rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the �1934 Act�).2 The Feeder Fund and any other investment company relying on this relief will do so in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of this Application. The Applicants represent that any person
presently intending to rely on the order requested in this Application is listed as an Applicant.
 The Feeder Fund is a Delaware limited
liability company that is registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Feeder Fund�s investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation. The Feeder Fund intends to invest
substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund, a Delaware limited liability company that is registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company in reliance on Section�12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act.
The Master Fund will not issue multiple classes of its units and is an Applicant because of the master-feeder structure. Through its investment in the Master Fund, the Feeder Fund operates as a �fund of funds� that provides a means for
investors to participate in investments in various Investment Funds (as defined below). The Master Fund expects to pursue its investment objective by investing primarily in private equity investments, including primary and secondary
(�secondaries�) investments in private  �
2 The terms �control,� �investment adviser,� and �principal underwriter� are
used as defined in Sections 2(a)(9), 2(a)(20), and 2(a)(29) of the 1940 Act, respectively. 
� 3



Table of Contents

equity, infrastructure, and other private asset funds (�Investment Funds�) and co-investments in portfolio companies, although the allocation among those types of investments may vary
from time to time. During the initial period of investment operations, the Adviser anticipates investing the private equity portion of its portfolio primarily in co-investments3 and/or secondaries
of Investment Funds. In managing the Master Fund, the Adviser will seek to invest across a broad spectrum of Investment Funds (e.g., buyout, growth capital, special situations, credit, private infrastructure, real estate, real assets, and other
private asset funds), determined by a diverse selection of geographies (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets) and vintage years (i.e., the year in which an Investment Fund begins investing). In addition, to maintain liquidity and
to fund Investment Fund capital calls, the Master Fund will invest in exchange-traded funds (�ETFs�)4 designed to track equity indexes and, to a lesser extent, in cash and short-term
securities. In addition, the Master Fund may use derivative instruments, primarily equity options and swaps, for hedging purposes to help protect the value of its ETF investments.

The Units are currently being offered in private placement transactions on a continuous basis at net asset value per unit, as described in the
Feeder Fund�s confidential memorandum (the �Confidential Memorandum�). The Feeder Fund, however, reserves the right to conduct a public offering of the Units under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the �Securities
Act�), in the future, and has filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to register the Units to enable it to conduct such a public offering. The Feeder Fund currently offers a single class of Units designated as �Advisory
Class Units� and, if the requested relief is granted, the Feeder  �
3 The Master Fund will not engage in co-investments alongside affiliates unless the Master Fund�s
application for an exemption from Section�17(d) of the 1940 Act is granted or unless such investments are not prohibited by Section�17(d) or interpretations of Section�17(d) as expressed in Commission no-action letters, including
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., SEC No-Action Letter (Pub. Avail. June�7, 2000).  4
Investments in ETFs will either comply with Section�12(d)(1) of the Act or such ETFs will have received an order from the Commission permitting such investments.

Table of Contents

Fund may offer continuously two additional classes of units, each having its own expense structure (�Transactional Class Units� and �Institutional Class Units�), in addition
to any additional classes of Units that may be offered in the future. The Units are currently only being sold and will only be sold to persons who are �accredited investors,� as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
The Units are not offered or traded in a secondary market and are not listed on any securities exchange or quoted on any quotation medium.
Because unitholders do not have the right to require the Feeder Fund to redeem Units, the Feeder Fund may from time to time repurchase Units pursuant to written tenders by unitholders in accordance with Rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act
(�Repurchases�), in order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to unitholders.5 Repurchases of the Feeder Fund�s Units will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such
terms as may be determined by the Feeder Fund�s board of directors (the �Board,� and each member a �Director�) in its sole discretion. In determining whether the Feeder Fund should repurchase Units, the Board will consider a
variety of operational, business and economic factors. The Adviser anticipates that it will recommend to the Board that the Feeder Fund repurchase Units from investors on a quarterly basis, commencing with the first fiscal quarter after two full
years of Fund operations, with the Repurchases to occur as of the last day of March, June, September, and December (or, if any such date is not a business day, on the immediately preceding business day). The Feeder Fund generally will not repurchase
Units unless the Master Fund simultaneously conducts a repurchase for the Master Fund�s units of beneficial interest.  �
5 Likewise, the Master Fund�s repurchases are currently conducted pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the
1934 Act. 
� 5



Table of Contents
As with open-end management investment companies that issue multiple classes of units pursuant to
Rule 18f-3 under the 1940 Act, the different classes of Units of the Feeder Fund would represent investments in the same portfolio of securities but would be subject to different expenses (such as asset-based distribution and/or service fees). Thus,
the net income attributable to, and any dividends payable on, each class of Units will differ from the other classes from time to time. As a result, the net asset value per Unit of the classes may differ over time.

Under the proposal, each class of Units would be offered at net asset value. Transactional Class Units and Institutional Class Units would be
offered at net asset value, and Transactional Class Units may (but would not necessarily) be subject to a front-end sales load and an annual asset-based distribution and/or service fee. Advisory Class Units would continue to be offered at net asset
value with the asset-based distribution and/or service fees disclosed in the Confidential Memorandum or prospectus, as supplemented or amended from time to time. Each class of Units would comply with the provisions of Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act,
or any successor thereto or replacement rules, as if that rule applied to closed-end management investment companies, and with the provisions of Rule 2830(d) of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(�NASD�), as such rule may be amended, or any successor rule thereto (�NASD Conduct Rule 2830�)6 as if it applied to the Feeder Fund. The structure of the proposed classes of
Units is described in detail below under �Statement of Facts � Proposed Class Structure and Characteristics.�  If this
Application is granted, Transactional Class Units and Institutional Class Units may or may not be offered. Additional classes of Units may be added in the future.

�
6 Any references to NASD Conduct Rule 2830 include any successor or replacement rule to NASD Conduct Rule
2830 that may be adopted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (�FINRA�).

Table of Contents
A number of precedents exist for the implementation of a multiple-class system and the
imposition of asset-based distribution and/or service fees for closed-end funds substantially similar to the relief sought by Applicants. See, e.g., Partners Group Private Equity (Master Fund), LLC and Partners Group (USA) Inc., Inv. Co. Act

II.
STATEMENT OF FACTS  �


�
A.
The Applicants  Each of the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund is a Delaware limited
liability company registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. Each of the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on May�16, 2014. 
The Adviser is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and is registered with the Commission as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the �Advisers Act�). Affiliated Managers Group, Inc., a publicly-
� 7



Table of Contents

traded company, indirectly owns a majority of the interests of the Adviser. The Adviser serves as the investment adviser to the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund.

The Placement Agent is registered with the Commission as a broker/dealer under the 1934 Act and will act as the principal underwriter of the
Feeder Fund.7 Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. indirectly owns 100% of the shares of the Placement Agent. Thus, the Placement Agent is under common control with the Adviser and is an affiliated
person, as defined in Section�2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act, of the Adviser.8  �


�
B.
Current Structure and Characteristics  As noted above, Units are currently being
offered on a continuous basis pursuant to a registration statement under the 1940 Act at their net asset value per unit and may be purchased on the first business day of any month, or at such other times as the Board may determine. The Units are
currently only being sold and will only be sold to persons who are �accredited investors,� as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
The Feeder Fund, as a closed-end investment company, does not continuously redeem Units as does an open-end management investment company.
Units of the Feeder Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an over-the-counter system. Furthermore, it is not expected that any secondary market will ever develop for the Units. Thus, in order to provide a limited degree
of liquidity to unitholders, the Feeder Fund may from time to time repurchase Units at their then current net asset value pursuant to written tenders by unitholders in accordance with Rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act. Repurchases will be made at such
times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion. The
 �
7 If the Units are publicly offered, the Placement Agent will be the Feeder Fund�s distributor. 
8 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser operates autonomously from Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.
and its affiliates, maintaining investment and operational control, and benefits from access to the resources of a larger international partner.

� 8



Table of Contents

Feeder Fund currently offers a single class of Units � Advisory Class Units � that is subject to a distribution and/or service fee (a �Distribution and/or Service Fee�)
pursuant to a distribution and service plan adopted in conformity with Rule 12b-1 of the Act (a �Distribution and Service Plan�) charged at the annual rate of 0.25%.9 
�


�
C.
Proposed Class Structure and Characteristics  The Feeder Fund proposes to engage in a
continuous offering of Units in the manner described below. The Feeder Fund proposes to offer multiple classes of Units, such as Advisory Class Units, Transactional Class Units and Institutional Class Units, described below, or any other classes.
Additional classes may permit an investor to choose the method of purchasing Units that the investor deems most beneficial, based on factors applicable to the investor, such as the amount of the purchase or the length of time the investor expects to
hold the Units. In the future, the Feeder Fund�s Board could adopt this or another sales charge structure.  Advisory Class Units
would continue to be subject to: (1)�minimum initial investment requirements of $50,000, and minimum subsequent investment requirements of $10,000, in each case, subject to certain exceptions; (2)�an annual asset-based Distribution and/or
Service Fee of 0.25%; and (3)�an Early Withdrawal Fee, in each case as set forth in the Confidential Memorandum or prospectus, as amended or supplemented from time to time. Advisory Class Units are currently only being sold and will only be
sold to persons who are �accredited investors,� as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.  �
9 Units are subject to an early withdrawal fee at a rate of 2% of the aggregate net asset value of the
unitholder�s Units repurchased by the Feeder Fund (the �Early Withdrawal Fee�) if the interval between the date of purchase of the Units and the valuation date with respect to the repurchase of those Units is less than one year. The
Early Withdrawal Fee charged by the Feeder Fund is not the same as a contingent deferred sales charge (�CDSC�) assessed by an open-end fund pursuant to Rule 6c-10 under the 1940 Act, as CDSCs are distribution-related charges payable to a
distributor, whereas the Early Withdrawal Fee is payable to the Feeder Fund to compensate long-term unitholders for the expenses related to shorter term investors, in light of the Feeder Fund�s generally longer-term investment horizons and
investment operations. Although the Feeder Fund does not currently intend to impose CDSCs, it would only do so pursuant to Rule 6c-10 under the 1940 Act. CDSCs may be necessary for the Placement Agent to recover distribution costs.

Institutional Class Units would be offered at net asset value, and it is anticipated that they
would not be subject to a front-end sales load or an annual asset-based Distribution and/or Service Fee. The Early Withdrawal Fee will equally apply to Institutional Class Units and to all other classes of Units of the Feeder Fund, consistent with
Section�18 of the 1940 Act and Rule 18f-3 thereunder. Additionally, Institutional Class Units will be subject to minimum initial investment requirements of $1,000,000, and minimum subsequent investment requirements of $100,000, in each case,
subject to certain exceptions. Institutional Class Units will only be sold to persons who are �accredited investors,� as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
Transactional Class Units would be offered at net asset value and may be subject to a front-end sales load and an annual asset-based
Distribution and/or Service Fee. The Early Withdrawal Fee will equally apply to Transactional Class Units. Additionally, Transactional Class Units will be subject to minimum initial investment requirements of $50,000, and minimum subsequent
investment requirements of $10,000, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. Transactional Class Units will only be sold to persons who are �accredited investors,� as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. 
Actual fees approved and adopted may vary, but a class of Units could not have annual asset-based Distribution and/or Service Fees in excess
of the limits established by NASD Conduct Rule 2830.
 The Feeder Fund has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan in voluntary compliance
with Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under the 1940 Act, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies. The Feeder Fund�s Board has adopted the Feeder Fund�s existing Distribution and Service Plan for Advisory Class Units
in a manner consistent with Rule 12b-1. The Distribution and Service Plan was approved by a majority of the Directors, including

a majority of the Directors who are not �interested persons� of the Feeder Fund (within the meaning of Section�2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act), and who have no direct or indirect
financial interest in the operation of the Distribution and Service Plan or in any agreements related to the Distribution and Service Plan, as provided for in Rule 12b-1. Pursuant to its Distribution and Service Plan, the Feeder Fund will pay the
Placement Agent an ongoing Distribution and/or Service Fee at an annualized rate of 0.25% of the average net assets attributable to Advisory Class Units. This Distribution and/or Service Fee consists of compensation for the distribution and investor
services provided to unitholders (such as responding to unitholder inquiries and providing information regarding investments in the Feeder Fund; processing purchase, exchange (if any), and redemption requests by beneficial owners; providing
sub-accounting with respect to Units beneficially owned by unitholders; and processing dividend payments for the Feeder Fund on behalf of unitholders). Applicants represent that these asset-based Distribution and/or Service Fees comply with the
provisions of NASD Conduct Rule 2830. Applicants represent that the Feeder Fund will comply with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act as if it were an open-end management investment company. 
All Distribution and/or Service Fees with respect to any Units of a newly created class, including Transactional Class Units, would be paid
pursuant to a Distribution and Service Plan adopted by the Feeder Fund with respect to the applicable class. Under the existing and any future Distribution and Service Plan, the Feeder Fund, either directly or indirectly, would compensate brokers,
dealers, or other financial intermediaries for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Units and for personal services provided to unitholders and/or the maintenance of unitholder accounts. Applicants represent that these asset-based
Distribution and/or Service Fees will comply with the provisions of NASD Conduct Rule 2830.

The Feeder Fund may offer an exchange privilege or conversion feature on certain of its future
classes of Units, and any such privilege or feature introduced in the future will comply with Rule 11a-1, Rule 11a-3, and Rule 18f-3 as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end investment company.

The Feeder Fund may waive the Early Withdrawal Fee for certain unitholders or transactions as established from time to time, including in
connection with exchanges and in circumstances where the Board determines that doing so is in the best interests of the Feeder Fund and in a manner as will not discriminate unfairly against any unitholder. With respect to any waiver of, scheduled
variation in, or elimination of the Early Withdrawal Fee, the Feeder Fund will comply with Rule 22d-1 under the 1940 Act as if the Early Withdrawal Fee were a CDSC and as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end investment company and the Feeder
Fund�s waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of, the Early Withdrawal Fee will apply uniformly to all unitholders of the Feeder Fund regardless of class. 
All expenses incurred by the Feeder Fund will be allocated among its various classes of Units based on the respective net assets of the Feeder
Fund attributable to each such class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect the expenses associated with the Distribution and Service Plan of that class (if any), shareholder service fees attributable to a
particular class (including transfer agency fees, if any), and any other incremental expenses of that class.
 In addition to front-end
sales charges and Distribution and/or Service Fees, each class of Units of the Feeder Fund may, by action of the Feeder Fund�s Board or its delegate, also pay a different amount of the following expenses:

COMMISSION AUTHORITY  Pursuant to Section�6(c) of the 1940 Act, the Commission
may, by order on application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the 1940 Act or from any rule or
regulation under the 1940 Act, if and to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
 Pursuant to Section�17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder, the Commission may issue an order permitting an affiliated

V.
DISCUSSION  �


�
A.
Background  In its 1992 study entitled Protecting Investors: A Half Century of
Investment Company Regulation (�Protecting Investors�), the Commission�s Division of Investment Management recognized that the 1940 Act imposes a rigid classification system that dictates many important regulatory
consequences.10 For example, the characterization of a management company as �open-end� or �closed-end� has, historically, been crucial to the determination of the degree of
liquidity the fund�s shareholders will have, and thus the liquidity required of the fund�s investments.  Historically, except as
noted below, there has been no middle ground between the two extremes of the open-end and the closed-end forms. Open-end funds have offered complete liquidity to their shareholders and thus required a high degree of liquidity of the underlying
investment portfolio, while closed-end funds have been subject to requirements that in fact restrict the liquidity they are permitted to offer their investors. Under this bipolar system of regulation, neither form has provided the best vehicle for
offering portfolios that have

Table of Contents

significant, but not complete, liquidity. In Protecting Investors, the staff of the Commission determined that, given the changes in the securities market since 1940 � in particular
the emergence of semi-liquid investment opportunities � it was appropriate to re-examine the classification system and its regulatory requirements and that it would be appropriate to provide the opportunity for investment companies to
�chart new territory� between the two extremes of the open-end and the closed-end forms, consistent with investor protection.11 
One exception to the open-end/closed-end dichotomy cited in Protecting Investors has been the so-called �prime rate
fund.� Many of these funds, first introduced in 1988, invest in adjustable rate senior loans and provide shareholders liquidity through quarterly repurchases (�Closed-End Tender Offer Funds�). 
Shortly after Protecting Investors was published, the Commission proposed Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act, which provided flexibility to
increase shareholder liquidity through periodic tender offers under simplified procedures.12 Rule 23c-3 was adopted in April 1993.13 Prime rate
funds were cited in both Protecting Investors and the Rule 23c-3 Proposing Release as the prototype for the closed-end interval fund concept.14 
Developments since the initial closed-end interval funds make further innovation appropriate. Many funds either cannot or choose not to rely
on Rule 23c-3. Therefore, there exist a large number of Closed-End Tender Offer Funds, which fall between open-end and closed-end designations in regard to their operations, but are not interval funds. Moreover, a number of precedents exist for the
implementation of a multiple-class system and the imposition

1940 Act, which began from the open-end, complete liquidity perspective under Section�22 and would permit periodic or delayed, rather than constant, liquidity. The Commission neither adopted nor withdrew proposed Rule 22e-3.

B.
Multiple Classes of Units � Exemptions from Sections 18(c) and 18(i) under the 1940 Act 
Applicants request exemptive relief to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of multiple classes of Units of the Feeder Fund may be
deemed: (1)�to result in the issuance of a �senior security� within the meaning of Section�18(g) of the 1940 Act and thus be prohibited by Section�18(c); and (2)�to violate the equal voting provisions of
Section�18(i) of the 1940 Act.  A registered closed-end investment company may have only one class of stock that is a senior
security. In particular, Section�18(c) of the 1940 Act provides in relevant part that:  [I]t shall be unlawful for
any registered closed-end investment company . . . to issue or sell any senior security which is a stock if immediately thereafter such company will have outstanding more than one class of senior security which is a stock, except that
(1)
� 18



Table of Contents

any such class of . . . stock may be issued in one or more series: provided, that no such series shall have a preference or priority over any other series upon the distribution of the assets of
such registered closed-end company or in respect of the payment of interest or dividends�.  Section�18(i) of the 1940 Act
provides in relevant part that:  Except as provided in subsection (a)�of this section, or as otherwise required by
law, every share of stock hereafter issued by a registered management company�shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock; provided, that this subsection shall not apply�to shares issued
in accordance with any rules, regulations, or orders which the Commission may make permitting such issue.  The multiple class system
proposed herein (the �Multiple Class System�) may result in Units of a class having �priority over [another] class as to�payment of�dividends� and having unequal voting rights, because under the Multiple Class System
(1)�unitholders of different classes may pay different distribution fees, different shareholder service fees, and any other expenses (as described above in Section II.C) that should be properly allocated to a particular class, and (2)�each
class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of units of the Feeder Fund may thus be prohibited by Section�18(c) and may violate
Section�18(i) of the 1940 Act.  Applicants believe that the implementation of the Multiple Class System will provide the Applicants
with the flexibility to create new classes of Units without having to create new feeder funds. Applicants believe that current and future unitholders will benefit if new classes of Units with different pricing structures are created providing
investors with enhanced investment options. Under the Multiple Class System, an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing Units that the investor deems most beneficial, based on factors applicable to the

� 19



Table of Contents

investor, such as the amount of the purchase, the length of time the investor expects to hold the Units, the use of a financial intermediary through which the Units will be purchased, and other
relevant factors. The proposed system would permit the Feeder Fund to facilitate the distribution of Units and provide investors with a broader choice of unitholder options.

By contrast, if the Applicants were required to create new, separate feeder funds rather than new classes of Units, the creation of the new,
separate feeder funds would involve increased costs and administrative burdens borne by unitholders, as compared to the creation of additional classes of Units of the Feeder Fund.

Under the Multiple Class System, holders of each class of Units may be relieved of a portion of the fixed costs normally associated with
investing in investment companies because these costs potentially would be spread over a greater number of Units than they would be if the classes were separate funds or portfolios. As the Feeder Fund grows in volume of assets, it is expected that
investors will derive benefits from economies of scale that might not be available at smaller volumes.
 The Commission has long recognized
that multiple class arrangements can be structured so that the concerns underlying the 1940 Act�s �senior security� provisions are satisfied. After having granted numerous exemptive orders (�multiple class exemptive orders�)
to open-end management investment companies permitting those funds to issue two or more classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio, in 1995, the Commission adopted Rule 18f-3 under the 1940 Act, which now permits open-end funds
to maintain or create multiple classes without seeking individual multiple class exemptive orders, as long as certain conditions are met.15 
�
15 See Inv. Co. Act Rel. No.�20915 (February 23, 1995). As adopted, Rule 18f-3 under the 1940
Act creates an exemption for open-end funds that issue multiple classes of shares with varying arrangements for the distribution of securities and the provision of services to shareholders. In connection with the adoption of Rule 18f-3, the
Commission also amended Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act to clarify that each class of shares must have separate 12b-1 plan provisions. Moreover, any action on the 12b-1 plan (i.e., director or shareholder approval) must take place separately for each
class. The Commission has adopted amendments to Rule 18f-3 that expand and clarify the methods by which a multiple class fund may allocate income, gains and losses, and expenses, and that clarify the shareholder voting provisions of the rule. 
� 20



Table of Contents
Applicants believe that the proposed Multiple Class System does not raise the concerns underlying
Section�18 of the 1940 Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies� multiple class structures. The Multiple Class System does not relate to borrowings and will not adversely affect the Feeder Fund�s assets. In
addition, the proposed system will not increase the speculative character of the Feeder Fund�s Units. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights is equitable and will not
discriminate against any group or class of unitholders.  Applicants believe that the rationale for and the conditions contained in Rule
18f-3 are as applicable to a closed-end investment company seeking to offer multiple classes of shares with varying distribution and service arrangements in a single portfolio as they are to open-end investment companies. The Feeder Fund will comply
with the provisions of Rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company including, among others, the rule�s provisions relating to differences in expenses, special allocations of other expenses, voting rights, conversion features,
exchange privileges and disclosure. In fact, the Feeder Fund will in many ways resemble an open-end investment company in its manner of operation and in the distribution of Units, except for differences related to Repurchases. 
In particular, the Feeder Fund proposes to offer Units continuously at net asset value. It is anticipated that differences among classes will,
as detailed above, relate largely to differences in placement/distribution and service arrangements and whether a front-end sales charge applies. Applicants note that open-end and closed-end funds are subject to different technical provisions
governing the issuance of senior securities. However, those technical differences do not appear

� 21



Table of Contents

relevant here. While closed-end funds may not issue multiple classes of shares without exemptive relief, the Commission has granted specific exemptive relief to numerous similarly-situated
closed-end funds.16 Provisions regulating the issuance by closed-end funds of debt or preferred stock should have no bearing on an application by a closed-end fund for an exemptive order
permitting the issuance of multiple classes of shares. Therefore, Applicants propose to base the conditions under which the Feeder Fund would issue multiple classes of Units on those contained in Rule 18f-3.

Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the asset-based Distribution and/or Service Fees
applicable to classes of the Feeder Fund in the manner required by Rule 18f-3 is equitable and will not discriminate against any group of unitholders. The Feeder Fund is also aware of the need for full disclosure of the proposed Multiple Class
System in its Confidential Memorandum or prospectus and of the differences among the various classes and the different expenses of each class of Units offered. Applicants represent that these Distribution and/or Service Fees will comply with the
provisions of NASD Conduct Rule 2830. Applicants also represent that the Feeder Fund will disclose in its Confidential Memorandum or prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Units offered for sale by the Confidential
Memorandum or prospectus, as is required for open-end, multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As if it were an open-end management

investment company, the Feeder Fund will disclose fund expenses borne by unitholders during the reporting period in shareholder reports17 and
describe in its Confidential Memorandum or prospectus any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or eliminations of sales loads.18 The Feeder Fund will include any such disclosures in its
shareholder reports and Confidential Memorandum or prospectus to the extent required as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end fund. The Feeder Fund and the Placement Agent will also comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or
FINRA regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and
revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Feeder Fund and the Placement Agent.19 The Feeder Fund and the Placement Agent will contractually require that any other
distributor or placement agent of the Feeder Fund�s Units comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution or private placement of Units of the Feeder Fund. 
Finally, in June 2006, the Commission adopted enhanced fee disclosure requirements for funds of funds.20 Applicants will comply with all such applicable disclosure requirements.

transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the Commission issues an order upon application permitting the transaction.

In reviewing applications pursuant to Section�17(d) and Rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether an investment company�s
participation in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the 1940 Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other
participants. Section�17(d) of the 1940 Act is intended to prevent or limit abuses arising from conflicts of interest; however, Section�17(d) itself does not prohibit any specific activities, but instead authorizes the Commission to
approve rules to limit or prevent an investment company from being a joint participant on a different or less advantageous basis than other participants. Under Rule 17d-1, it is unlawful for an affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for a
registered investment company, acting as principal, to participate in or effect any transaction in connection with a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the investment company is a participant, without prior Commission approval. The
protections provided for in Section�17(d) essentially allow the Commission to set standards for all transactions concerning an investment company and an affiliate which could be construed as self-dealing or overreaching by the affiliate to the
detriment of the investment company.  The Feeder Fund will comply with the protections for open-end investment companies developed and
approved by the Commission in Rule 12b-1 in connection with its Distribution and Service Plan(s), if any, with respect to each class as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end investment company. Therefore, the Feeder Fund will participate in
substantially the same way and under substantially the same conditions as would be the case with an open-end investment company imposing asset-based distribution and/or service fees under Rule 12b-1. Applicants

note that, at the same time the Commission adopted Rule 12b-1,23 it also adopted Rule 17d-3 to provide an exemption from Section�17(d)
and Rule 17d-1 to the extent necessary for arrangements between open-end funds and their affiliated persons or principal underwriters (or affiliated persons of such persons or principal underwriters) whereby payments are made by the open-end fund
with respect to distribution, if such agreements are entered into in compliance with Rule 12b-1. In its adopting release, the Commission stated: 
The Commission wishes to emphasize that it has no intention of categorizing certain transactions as raising the
applicability of Section�17(d) and Rule 17d-3 of the 1940 Act. The Commission�s only comment is that to the extent that arrangements in which a fund pays for its distribution costs could involve the fund in a �joint enterprise�
with an affiliated person, and if such arrangements were entered into in compliance with rule 12b-1, the Commission sees no need for prior Commission review and approval of the arrangements.24
 Applicants believe that any Section�17(d) concerns the Commission might have in connection with the Feeder Fund�s financing the
distribution of its Units should be resolved by the Feeder Fund�s undertakings to comply with the provisions of Rule 12b-1 and Rule 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies. Accordingly, Applicants undertake to comply,
and undertake that the Feeder Fund�s distribution fee (if any) will comply, with the provisions of Rule 12b-1 and Rule 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies. 
Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of Section�6(c) of the 1940 Act. Rule 6c-10 under the 1940 Act permits
open-end investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. Although the Feeder Fund does not anticipate imposing CDSCs, Applicants would only do so in compliance with Rule 6c-10 as if that rule applied to

closed-end investment companies. The Feeder Fund also would make all required disclosures in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs. Applicants further state that, in the
event it imposes CDSCs, the Feeder Fund will apply the CDSCs (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the CDSCs) uniformly to all unitholders of a given class and consistently with the requirements of Rule 22d-1 under the 1940 Act. Finally, to
the extent the Feeder Fund determines to waive, impose scheduled variations of, or eliminate the Early Withdrawal Fee, it will do so consistently with the requirements of Rule 22d-1 under the 1940 Act and the Feeder Fund�s waiver of, scheduled
variation in, or elimination of, the Early Withdrawal Fee will apply uniformly to all unitholders of the Feeder Fund.  �


VI.
APPLICANTS� CONDITION  The Applicants agree that any order granting the requested
relief will be subject to the following condition:
 Applicants will comply with the provisions of Rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3, 22d-1, and, where applicable, 11a-3 under the 1940 Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with NASD Conduct Rule 2830,
as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

VII.
CORPORATE ACTION  The Feeder Fund�s Limited Liability Company Agreement empowers
the Board of the Feeder Fund to establish different classes of Units and to take such other action with respect to the Units as the Board may deem desirable. The Board has adopted resolutions, attached as Exhibit B, authorizing the Feeder
Fund�s officers to file the Application with the Commission.

VIII.
CONCLUSION  For the reasons stated above, Applicants submit that the exemptions
requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants also believe that the requested relief meets
the standards for relief in Section�17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder. Applicants desire that the Commission issue the requested order pursuant to Rule 0-5 under the 1940 Act without conducting a hearing. 
All of the requirements for execution and filing of this Application on behalf of the Applicants have been complied with in accordance with
the organizational documents of the Applicants, and the undersigned officers of the Applicants are fully authorized to execute this Application. The verifications required by Rule 0-2(d) under the 1940 Act are attached to this Application.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
