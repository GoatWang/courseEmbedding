This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

H.C. Starck expects sustained recovery of core markets in 2017
Far-reaching cost reductions compensate part of decrease in sales in 2016Group annual sales at 688.4 million eurosNew corporate legal structure successfully implementedMunich, April 5th, 2017.
 H.C. Starck, one of the leading manufacturers of customer-specific 
powders and components made from technology metals and advanced 
ceramics, expects to see a sustained recovery of its core markets in the
 2017 fiscal year. During the past fiscal year 2016, sales were down due
 to the tough market environment and decreases in the prices of raw 
materials. With an overall value of 688.4 million euros, the annual 
turnover remained below the previous year’s figure of 815.2 million 
euros. As of December 31, 2016, the company had about 2,600 employees 
worldwide (2015: about 2,700).
