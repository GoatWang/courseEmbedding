LONDON — A group of former Barclays executives appeared in a London court on Monday to answer charges that they conspired to misrepresent arrangements made with the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar in 2008, as the bank raised capital to help it weather the financial crisis.British prosecutors charged the lender and four former executives — including a former chief executive, John S. Varley — last month, the first criminal charges to be brought in Britain against a bank over its actions during the financial crisis. The men charged are among the most senior bank managers anywhere in the world to face trial in a financial crisis-era case.The investigation is among several that Barclays faces over its 2008 actions, when it raised $15 billion from Qatar and other investors with two capital infusions, in June 2008 and in October 2008. That allowed it to avoid a government bailout, unlike several British rivals.The five-year inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office of Britain has revolved around whether Barclays properly disclosed an agreement with Qatar in which it paid more than 300 million pounds, or $390 million at current exchange rates, for “advisory services” as part of the fund-raising, and around a $3 billion loan facility that Barclays made available to the Qatari government in November 2008.

The bank, along with Mr. Varley and Mr. Jenkins, both 61, has also been charged with providing unlawful financial assistance and an additional conspiracy count related to the October 2008 capital raising.Lawyers for Mr. Varley and Jenkins said that their clients intended to plead not guilty. Mr. Boath has previously denied wrongdoing, as has the bank. A lawyer for Mr. Kalaris declined to comment after Monday’s hearing.The men were released on bail on Monday after a brief hearing in Westminster Magistrates’ Court. Mr. Kalaris, who is American but lives in London, and Mr. Jenkins, who lives in California, will be required to put up £500,000 in security as part of their bail.

Mr. Jenkins was executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa at Barclays Capital at the time of the fund-raising, and he played a central role in helping to arrange it.Mr. Kalaris, also 61, was the chief executive of Barclays Wealth and Investment Management. Mr. Boath, 58, was the European head of Barclays’ Financial Institutions Group.The inquiry is one of a number of regulatory issues that have plagued Barclays in recent years.The bank paid $450 million in penalties over accusations it helped manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and its American chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., subsequently resigned.In December, the United States Justice Department sued the bank, accusing it of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages. Barclays has said the claims are “disconnected from the facts” and has vowed to “vigorously defend” itself.In April, the bank disclosed that James E. Staley, the current chief executive, was being investigated by the British authorities after he sought to learn the identity of a whistle-blower. Mr. Staley has apologized for his handling of the matter.In addition to the fraud office, the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the bank’s 2008 fund-raising.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
