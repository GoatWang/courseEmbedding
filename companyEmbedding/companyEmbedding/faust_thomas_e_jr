With Thomas E. Faust Jr. of Eaton Vance Corp.

      Thomas E. Faust Jr. soon will be wearing driving gloves to work at Eaton Vance Corp.As the mandatory retirement of chief executive James B. Hawkes approaches, Mr. Faust, 47, is preparing to become his successor. In January, Mr. Faust, who has been serving as Eaton Vance's chief investment officer for the past six years, also was named president of the Boston-based fund company. Mr. Hawkes must retire in late 2007 in accordance with the company's mandatory-retirement policy.
				



Duncan W. Richardson, 48, the firm's chief equity investment officer, meanwhile, was named executive vice president.Those close to Eaton Vance say Mr. Faust's ascension hardly is a surprise. For years, they say, Mr. Faust, who joined the company in 1985 as an equity analyst, has worked closely with Mr. Hawkes. Among the goals he would like to accomplish when he takes over is the further diversification of Eaton Vance's product base.Under Mr. Hawkes, Eaton Vance has distinguished itself - and gained assets - by focusing on more-obscure parts of the market, such as municipal bonds, tax-managed funds and bank-loan funds. Now it is time to focus on "plain vanilla" offerings, such as building out the firm's capabilities in value-oriented investing, Mr. Faust said.On the growth side, an acquisition could be in Eaton Vance's future, he added. No matter what, it won't be easy."It's going to take them some time," said Geoff Bobroff, a fund consultant in East Greenwich, R.I. "I mean, there are some very good value and growth shops out there," he said. "I'm not exactly sure how Eaton Vance will distinguish itself."Q. How much of this promotion is a surprise?A. It's not much of a surprise. I have been executive vice president, which is the title Eaton Vance has used for the No. 2 person, for a long time.Q. Will this be a harbinger of other management changes?A.Over the period between now and October of next year, Duncan [Richardson] and I will be working with Jim [Hawkes] on some succession [issues]. There are other members of senior management who are of similar vintage who will be retiring over the next couple of years.Q. Will you and Mr. Richardson bring people in from the outside to assume top management positions at Eaton Vance?A. I don't think so. There are some openings that will be created by a couple of other people that are approaching retirement. There are also openings created by Duncan and me moving into new areas of responsibility. But no, this is not intended as a house cleaning or a shuffle of the deck.Q. So is there an area of the market where Eaton Vance is underrepresented?A. One of those areas is the institutional market. That is an area we didn't really talk about until a year ago when we started a major initiative that is now just hitting its stride. Over the next decade, or even two decades, we expect a much closer balance between retail and institutional.Q. Why now?A.We preach diversification as an investment discipline. We tell investors it's a way to enhance risk-adjusted returns. We think that way about our own business. We want to be diversified across investment capabilities.Q. Where do financial advisers fit into your plans?A. Well, 80% of our current business is through financial advisers. If we had been having this conversation six or eight years ago, we'd be debating whether that number goes up or down. It's pretty much been decided that the financial world is too complicated a place for most people to do it on their own. We believe advisers will be our primary access point for individual investors for years and years to come.Q. Are there any efforts under way to court advisers differently?A. The retail-sales environment is changing and moving toward an institutional model with more-centralized evaluation and screening and approval of products. We generally think it makes sense for there to be a centralized group at most distribution companies that vets different products and styles. So as a result, we've increased our resources devoted to that channel.Q. So what does that mean?A. Key-account managers are the people that interface with these teams. So rather than having an army of wholesalers who call on individual advisers, we've got a team of people calling on headquarters of different broker-dealer firms talking about products and trying to get our funds included in various products.Q. Are you aiming primarily at wirehouses or are you also going after regional brokers?A. We're aiming for pretty broad penetration in both areas. Q. How are you hoping to bring diversification to the investment side of the business? A. On the equity side, one area for more diversification would be large-cap value.Q. But Eaton Vance has had products in this area for a long time. Why do you think that that product is being underutilized by advisers?A. Our two large-cap-value funds have about $3.5 billion in assets in total. While that is not chicken feed, it's certainly not on the same scale of someone like American Funds.

Q. Agreed. But why isn't it bigger?
A. Some of it is that it hasn't been an area of marketing focus for us. We had our hands full in the early 1990s being the king of municipal bond funds. In the late 1990s, we had our hands full with being the king of tax-managed investing and bank-fund investing.Q. Why not stay with niche products? A. If you start from a base of $112 billion, it's harder to grow by being a niche company. One of the things about large-cap value is that it's not a niche; it's a mainstream category where, if we do well and continue to serve the interest of clients, we can add another zero or more to that $3.5 billion that we are managing in the fund business.Q. Do you have any plans to expand into more alternative products, such as hedge funds?A. We've looked at them, but so far, we have not been tempted to go that way. As a retail product, funds of hedge funds have some challenges, the biggest one being layers of fees that make it hard to add value.Q. What are your thoughts about the future of the mutual fund industry?A. The fund industry remains a very attractive place to be. The demographics of baby boomers saving for retirement still remain a positive factor. Overall, I think the wind remains at the back of the mutual fund industry. Q. What are your views about what's happening in the stock market these days? A. I feel pretty good about the stock market. We've gone through a period where year after year, we've talked about how stocks are overvalued. But what we've seen over the last four years of above-average earnings growth and relatively modest equity market returns is that valuations have come in a fair bit. Q. Do you have any concerns about the economy?A. We might see a little bit of a slowing this year, but nothing to get concerned about. I mean, we've seen a number of increases of short-term interest rates, and very often, that is a precursor to a slowing in the economy. It hasn't happened yet, but it's something to watch carefully.Q.Are you making any changes to Eaton Vance's overall investment strategy?A. On the equity side, we have been thinking that the market is moving to a neutral point, where growth and value ought to be performing more comparably. Q. What about the fixed-income side?A. We're still keeping the durations relatively short. We scratch our heads a little bit when we look at the inflation numbers and commodities prices. How do you justify long bonds where they are? So we are still cautious there. But at some point, we will probably lose that caution. Q. Are there any acquisitions on Eaton Vance's horizon?A. One area where we have talked about possibly making some acquisitions to broaden our capability is actually in the large-cap-growth space. We have some large-cap-growth product through an affiliate in Atlanta. But it's a large and important area, and we would be open to adding some additional capabilities.
