​  Regenicin Signs Supplier Agreement with Pure Med Farma LLC to Provide Closed Herd Collagen for the Manufacturing of NovaDerm® (Little Falls, NJ) – November 17, 2016 - Regenicin, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: RGIN), a biotechnology company specializing in the development and commercialization of regenerative cell therapies to restore the health of damaged tissues and organs, today announced that they have signed a supplier agreement with Pure Med Farma, LLC (PMF) to provide closed herd collagen for the production of its proprietary collagen scaffolds for the manufacturing of NovaDerm®. PMF is a related1 biotechnology company dedicated to bringing safe Animal Source Materials (ASMs) and Xenotransplantation materials to the global healthcare market using proprietary closed herd technology and biosecurity practices.                                                                                          The agreement with PMF states Regenicin will receive priority pricing and guaranteed inventory availability. This is a key milestone, as guidance documents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearly state that any product requesting approval to enter clinical trials will be denied until the applicant presents evidence that components derived from animal sources were obtained from closed herds.2 According to Randall McCoy, Chief Executive Officer of Regenicin, “Regenicin will only use  bovine closed herd collagen to produce NovaDerm. Using collagen that comes from a bovine closed herd provides a significant breakthrough in safety, as closed herd quality systems are designed to minimize exposure to pathogens which could be transferred to humans when using animal components for healthcare.”                                                                                                                                   About Closed HerdsClosed herd animal products ensure that controls have been put into place that prevent animals from being exposed to outside pathogens and avoid the use of hormones and unnecessary antibiotics that could jeopardize human health. Products from a closed herd can be traced back to a specific certified animal, its parents, its health, its food supply and more. About RegenicinRegenicin, Inc.

Investor Relations Overview
Regenicin, Inc. is an early-stage, biotechnology company specializing in the development of regenerative cell therapies for wound care and tissue regeneration. Regenicin's lead product is, NovaDerm® a cultured cell technology that uses a small full thickness biopsy of the patient's skin that can be grown in the laboratory to generate new living skin for grafting large areas of the patient in cases where there is insufficient healthy skin to cover the damaged areas (wounds, ulcers or thermal electrical or chemical burns). This approach is intended to reduce the chances of patient immune rejection, by using autologous grafts that can connect to the blood supply and continue to regenerate and, grow like normal skin. In addition, NovaDerm is intended to provide physicians and patients with a new, safer approach to skin regeneration, by using technologies that can protect the patient from external pathogens that might be found in traditional collagen-based products.
Investment Highlights:

Tissue engineering and cell therapy represents a market that is expected to grow from $6.9 billion in 2009 to almost $32 billion by 2018 in the U.S. alone, according to MedMarket Diligence.
The rapid growth has been attributed primarily to demonstrable clinical benefits, a clearly defined regulatory path, and a readiness by clinicians to adopt products for use.
Regenicin is well positioned to become a leader in one of the fastest growing industries in biotechnology.

Product CandidateNovaDerm is being developed as regenerative cell therapy that can re-grow a patient's own skin by harvesting fibroblast and keratinocytes from full thickness skin biopsy that is a small fraction of the size of the damaged area of skin. NovaDerm is composed of both epidermal (outer skin) and dermal (inner skin) layers with an autologous extracellular matrix.  The cell culturing process followed by meshing can provide enough autologous skin to graft an area up to 200 times larger than the initial biopsy. NovaDerm when grafted is not just a dermis and epidermis from the patient's own cells but also contains collagen produced by the patient's own fibroblast during culturing. The autologous fibroblast produce reticular and elastic fibers that make up the extracellular matrix.  NovaDerm is currently being validated to test the company's new process and approach to developing NovaDerm  with its unique collagen matrix.
NovaDerm is expected to be the only cultured skin substitute to not be designated with a drug component by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating Burn victims with total burned surface areas greater than 30%. NovaDerm is being developed to ensure the cultured skin substitute is available when the patient needs it. NovaDerm may be available for grafting in less than a month and with a shelf life longer than a week. 
Collagen Safety As antibiotic resistance is on the rise, and superbugs are none responsive to the current antibiotics on the market, it is more important now than in any other time in history to take the proper precautions to protect our population from pathogens.
Collagen is a protein that is naturally produced in the bodies of animals (especially mammals) and is the main component of connective tissues like cartilage. NovaDerm, like other regenerative skin candidates in development, are built on collagen scaffolds. Most of the collagen supply comes from animals of unknown origins or medical history. A large amount of animal components destined for medical use are imported from foreign countries like China for which the FDA has no authority before the abattoir. Currently the majority of animal components are collected from slaughter houses which do not have the traceability or adequate controls to prevent the use of animal components contaminated with pathogens. The controls used for food are not adequate for materials that are going to be used for medical products. However, since the 2008 Heparin Crisis where, large amounts of heparin was found to be contaminated contributing to the deaths of patients, additional testing procedures were put into place to prevent it from happening again. The FDA and other regulatory bodies have established regulations to mitigate the risk of pathogens being transplanted into humans. Those regulations have yet to be enforced.
In an effort to find safe collagen supplies within the U.S. and abroad, Regenicin, is identifying and will only enter into exclusive agreements with suppliers that only produce collagen from closed herds. A closed herd has an advantage in that the animals within the herd are no longer being exposed to potential carriers of diseases or parasites brought in from outside the herd.  In fact, each source of collagen can be traced back to a specific certified animal, its health, its food supply and more. In broad terms closed herd animal products ensures that controls have been put into place to prevent exposure of the parents and grandparents of the closed herd animal, the entire life of the harvested animal, a dedicated facility to harvest the materials, and traceability through cGMP manufacturers and the use by the patient.
NovaDerm  is intended to be the first product of its kind to use a collagen matrix produced exceeding international and FDA closed herd regulations. NovaDerm's  collagen scaffold has the traceability required for Xenotranspant materials. NovaDerm is processed to mitigate the risk of contamination of unwanted pathogens in every step of the process.
Technology and ManufacturingNovaDerm and related product candidates will be produced a cGMP facility, ensuring safety and efficacy. A small full thickness biopsy of the patient's skin can be expanded to cover 200 times its area in as little as 30 days. Self-to-self skin grafts form skin tissue that is not rejected by the immune system of the patient, which is a critical possibility in porcine or cadaver skin grafts used today.
CommercializationThe technology for NovaDerm has been developed by studying the development of skin substitutes over the last 25 years. The skin substitute technologies that are the basis of the NovaDerm  product have been clinically tested in numerous FDA sanctioned clinical trials  by various companies. Integra Dermal Regeneration Template,  Apligraft, and Dermagraft all similar temporary skin substitute technologies have been approved by the FDA. NovaDerm® is the only permanent autogolus cultured skin substitute designed to be available for the patient within 30 days of acquiring the harvest skin used to culture NovaDerm®. The American Medical Association has assigned CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) code for cultured skin substitutes under the dermal substitute category, which enables insurance companies to process, and hospitals to be reimbursed for, cultured skin substitutes once approved by the FDA.

Regenicin, Inc. 10 High Court Little Falls, NJ 07424  **updated and correct phone number**  (973) 557-8914   they filed this on aug 22 2016-  http://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=11558959              Name: Randall McCoy   Title: Principal Executive Officer and Director   Date: August 22, 2016               Name: John J. Weber   Title: Principal Financial Officer and Director   Date: August 22, 2016       FDA Issues Status Approval for PermaDerm®    sold to AMBS for 3,500,000$ in cash + 3,000,000$ in AMBS stocks LITTLE FALLS, N.J., June 12, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Regenicin, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: RGIN) a biotechnology company specializing in the development of and commercialization of regenerative cell therapies to restore the health of damaged tissues and organs, announced today that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Status approval for the PermaDerm® product, the only tissue-engineered skin prepared from autologous (patient's own) skin cells consisting of both epidermal and dermal layers, that is indicated for catastrophic burn patients.  The FDA had previously designated PermaDerm® to be a biological/drug (permanent skin replacement) not a medical device (temporary skin replacement). PermaDerm® is the only skin replacement technology to receive this Biological/drug designation.  COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS:  PermaDerm® is the only skin replacement technology to receive this Biological/drug designation 	Only 83million shares outstanding A/O May 18th, 2012 	Recently release their 10Q CLICK HERE TO VIEW 	PermaDerm technology has been clinically tested in over 150 pediatric, catastrophic burn patients. Currently Regenicin is working with its contract manufacturer to prepare for pre-market approval of PermaDerm™ from the FDA. 	Cambrex Biosciences, the company that owned Cutanogen, which holds the license rights to PermaDermTM, to help in the regulatory process to gain FDA approval of PermaDermTM. When Lonza purchased Cambrex they also purchased Cutanogen. Lonza's core business is contract manufacturing of cell therapy bio medical products. They did not wish to pursue FDA approval or market the product. Mr. McCoy, understanding the value of the product and familiar with the regulatory process, offered to purchase the rights to the product. So we believe that Lonza entered into the Know-How and License Agreement (the "Agreement") because we have expertise in working with the FDA on the approval             About PermaDerm PermaDerm™ is being developed to be the only tissue-engineered skin prepared from autologous (patient's own) skin cells consisting of both epidermal and dermal layers. A small harvested section of the patient's own skin can be grown to graft an area one hundred times its size in as little as thirty days. These living, self-to-self skin graft tissue are intended to form permanent skin tissue that will not be rejected by the immune system of the patient, a critical possibility in porcine or cadaver skin grafts used today. The technology has been clinically tested in over 150 pediatric, catastrophic burn patients. Currently Regenicin is working with its contract manufacturer to prepare for pre-market approval of PermaDerm™ from the FDA. PermaDerm™ is being designed to save lives, reduce healthcare costs by decreasing the patient's stay in the Critical Care Unit and reduce the need for additional surgeries. An insurance company procedural code has been approved for reimbursement of costs to hospitals. The American Medical Association has assigned CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) code for cultured skin substitutes under the dermal substitute category which enables insurance companies to process and hospitals to be reimbursed for cultured skin substitutes once approved by the FDA.     For Burns  According to the American Burn Association, there are currently over 2,000 cases annually involving burns covering over 50% of the patient's total body surface area. PermaDerm™ is being developed for the treatment of catastrophic, full-thickness burns covering over 50% of the total body surface area. PermaDerm™ has been used in clinical trials on pediatric patients with catastrophic burns covering from 50 to 90+% of their body. PermaDerm™ is being developed to require less donor skin from the patient's own body, thus needing fewer surgeries to harvest skin. The result is expected to be less scarring, with fewer infections and faster healing.    Board of Directors Randall McCoy Chief Executive Officer   Randall McCoy has more than 37 years of experience in the healthcare industry.
