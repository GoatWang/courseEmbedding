Outstanding Comfort.Reliable Performance.Rugged Construction.

	In 1975, David Clark Company introduced the first noise-attenuating headset designed to provide hearing protection for pilots, while also providing clear reception and crisp transmission at normal voice levels in a noisy aircraft. Since then, the 'green domes' have consistently set the standards of comfort, quality and performance in aviation headset design and manufacture.
	

	Today, our broad line of passive noise attenuating and Electronic Noise Cancelling (ENC) aviation headsets for both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft is the top choice for general aviation and commercial pilots.
