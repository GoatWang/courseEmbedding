7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

Nuveen Dow 30SM DynamicOverwrite Fund (DIAX)



What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

              SpaceX has raised up to $350 million in a new round of financing that would value the company at around $21 billion, a vote of confidence for billionaire founder Elon Musk who is seeking to prove the rocket maker can use reusable engines to speed up launches and become a major satellite operator.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

PIMCO Launches the PIMCO Flexible Credit Income Fund
The fund’s interval fund structure combines attributes of a traditional mutual fund and a closed end fund



















February 22, 2017 09:00 ET

 | Source: PIMCO Account Management






NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Feb.  22, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PIMCO, a leading global investment management firm, has launched the PIMCO Flexible Credit Income Fund, an interval fund that aims to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and current income by investing across global credit sectors, including consumer, corporate, emerging market, mortgage and municipal bonds. The fund will be managed by a team of portfolio managers based in Newport Beach, New York and London. The interval fund structure combines certain attributes of a closed end fund and a traditional mutual fund. As an unlisted closed-end fund, it looks to provide greater flexibility in targeting potentially higher returning, less liquid assets while offering the fund enhanced liquidity protection* should markets become stressed. The fund has greater flexibility to invest in illiquid securities and assets than open-end mutual funds. Similar to a mutual fund, the fund is continuously offered.  Additionally, investors can sell their shares back to the fund, although unlike the daily liquidity of a mutual fund, they may only be able to do so on a quarterly basis through repurchase offers (currently expected to be at 5% of outstanding shares).**   “In a low yielding environment, it is increasingly important to have the flexibility and resources to invest in both the public and private credit markets,” said Alfred Murata, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager. “We believe the flexibility of an interval fund structure allows investors to seek to capitalize on dislocations across global credit markets while remaining flexible to better navigate periods of short-term volatility.” The PIMCO Flexible Credit Income Fund is the firm’s first interval fund. The structure expands access to our flexible, opportunistic credit capabilities that PIMCO already deploys in our private credit vehicles. Mr. Murata; Dan Ivascyn, Managing Director and Group Chief Investment Officer; Mark Kiesel, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of Global Credit; Marc Seidner, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of Non-traditional Strategies; Christian Stracke, Managing Director and Global Head of Credit Research; and Eve Tournier, Executive Vice President and Head of European Credit Portfolio Management, are jointly and primarily responsible for day-to-day management of the fund. About PIMCO  PIMCO is a leading global investment management firm, with offices in 11 countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Founded in 1971, PIMCO offers a wide range of innovative solutions to help millions of investors worldwide meet their needs. Our goal is to provide attractive returns while maintaining a strong culture of risk management and long-term discipline. PIMCO is owned by Allianz S.E., a leading global diversified financial services provider. *Liquidity protection refers to the fact that the fund is not subject to the more restrictive liquidity requirements of an open-end registered investment company.  It is not meant to suggest that the fund is a liquid investment. Investors should consider shares of the fund to be an illiquid investment. **A 2% repurchase fee on shares accepted for repurchase by the Fund that have been held for less than one year. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing.  This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative or by visiting www.pimco.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money. The fund is an unlisted closed-end “interval fund.” Limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the fund’s quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% to 25% (currently expected to be 5%) of its outstanding shares at net asset value. There is no secondary market for the fund’s shares and none is expected to develop. Investors should consider shares of the fund to be an illiquid investment. It is important to note that differences exist between the fund’s daily internal accounting records, the fund’s financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations. It is possible that the fund may not issue a Section 19 Notice in situations where the fund’s financial statements prepared later and in accordance with U.S. GAAP or the final tax character of those distributions might later report that the sources of those distributions included capital gains and/or a return of capital. Please see the fund’s most recent shareholder report for more details. The fund’s distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, fund performance, and other factors. There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in the fund distribution rate at a future time. A word about risk: Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. Mortgage-related assets and other asset-backed instruments may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee, there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Bank loans are often less liquid than other types of debt instruments and general market and financial conditions may affect the prepayment of bank loans, as such the prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. There is no assurance that the liquidation of any collateral from a secured bank loan would satisfy the borrower’s obligation, or that such collateral could be liquidated.  Investments in distressed loans and bankrupt companies are speculative and the repayment of default obligations contains significant uncertainties.  The value of real estate and portfolios that invest in real estate may fluctuate due to: losses from casualty or condemnation, changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, property tax rates, regulatory limitations on rents, zoning laws, and operating expenses. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. The use of leverage may cause a portfolio to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements. Leverage, including borrowing, may cause a portfolio to be more volatile than if the portfolio had not been leveraged.   An investment in an interval fund is not suitable for all investors. Unlike typical closed-end funds an interval fund’s shares are not typically listed on a stock exchange. Although interval funds provide limited liquidity to investors by offering to repurchase a limited amount of shares on a periodic basis, investors should consider shares of the Fund to be an illiquid investment.  Investments in interval funds are therefore subject to liquidity risk as an investor may not be able to sell the shares at an advantageous time or price. There is also no secondary market for the Fund’s shares and none is expected to develop. There is no guarantee that an investor will be able to tender all or any of their requested Fund shares in a periodic repurchase offer. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are suitable for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for a long term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. Investors should consult their investment professional prior to making an investment decision.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

Each data point can be viewed by moving your mouse through the chart. The vertical bars below the chart represent Volume and are color-coded to indicate market activity for the day:  An up day (where the price is greater than the previous price) will show a green bar. A down day (where the price is less than the previous price) will show a red bar. When the price is unchanged compared to the previous price, Volume will show as a blue bar.  On futures charts, the horizontal purple line above the Volume bars represents Open Interest. Technical Charts have the option to create Spread Charts , with the ability to choose from a number of common spreads (such as Corn 1-2, Soybeans Crush, and Wheat Butterfly), or allowing you to enter your own custom spread calculation (supporting all futures, equities, index and forex symbols). Chart Settings A chart form resides below the chart. This is where you can change the symbol, style, time frame, and other chart settings. If you are logged in to your My Barchart account, you will also see a drop-down list for any Chart Templates you've previously saved. Simply select one from the list and the settings on the template will be applied to the current chart. Basic Chart  Bar Type - choose from OHLC Bars, Candlesticks, Hollow Candlesticks, Line or Area Volume On - displays or hides the volume for the symbol. Time Frame - determines the period (Frequency) and amount of data that will be displayed on the chart (Time Period and Start/End Dates).  For Frequency, choose from Intraday, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. for Commodity Contracts, you may also select a chart for the Contract, Nearest Futures Contract, or a Continuation chart Nearest Futures and Continuation Charts Commodity charts have three additional frequencies for Daily, Weekly and Monthly data: Contract, Nearest, and Continuation.  Daily/Weekly/Monthly Contract will plot prices for that specific contract   Daily/Weekly/Monthly Nearest Futures will use whatever contract was the Nearest Futures contract on the date of the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used to build the corresponding bar Daily/Weekly/Monthly Continuation Chart will always use the same MONTH specified in the chart form to build the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used (in this case, December, or Z)  The information is back-dated to the start of the period, so on a 5-minute chart information in the period dated 12:45 includes all trades between 12:45 and 12:49 inclusive. A trade at 13:00 would be included within the next bar dated 13:00.     A default Time Period is set based on your Frequency setting. For example, an Intraday chart will use a Time Period of 3 Days, while a Daily chart uses a Time Period of 6 Months. You may change the Time Period to increase or decrease the density of the bars displayed on the chart. The longer the time frame, the closer together the individual bars. The shorter the time frame, the more distance between the bars. You may override or further define the Time Period, or generate a historical chart, by entering a Start and End Date for the data. For example, you can get a Daily chart with 6 months of data from one year ago by entering an End Date from one year back.     Display Settings - further define what the chart will look like.  Price Box - when checked, displays a "Data View" window as you mouse-over the chart, showing OHLC for the bar, and all indicator values for the given bar.  Price Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows prices. % Change Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows the percent change from the open. Linear Scale - when on, scaling will calculate the most intelligent scale using the high, the low and a series of acceptable divisors for possible scales. Logarithmic Scale - when on, uses logarithmic scaling instead of the linear scaling.    Spread Chart Spread Charts allow you to choose from a number of common commodity spread chart calculations. You may also create your own custom spread chart by selecting up to three commodity contracts and multipliers, or by entering your own custom spread expression. The calculated results are displayed as a line chart. Expression: shows the calculation used to create the chart. When you select a Common Spread from the drop-down list, or when you create a Futures Spread using the fields on the form, the Expression is built automatically for you.  If you want to create your own custom Expression, you can enter the calculation directly into the Expression field. Valid syntax for an Expression calculation includes the use of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) between each leg. Calculations are performed from left to right, unless you change the order of the calculation using parentheses. Examples:  IBM-DELL subtracts the last price of DELL from IBM. 2*IBM+DELL multiplies IBM by two, then adds the price of DELL. 2*DELL/3+IBM multiplies DELL by two, then divides by three, then adds IBM. (2*DELL)/(3+IBM) multiplies DELL by two, then divides the result by the sum of three plus IBM. $DXY-$SPX subtracts the S&P 500 Index from the Dollar Index. ^USDCAD+^CADAUD adds the Canadian Dollar/Australian Dollar to the US Dollar/Canadian Dollar.  Note for Futures Contracts: Barchart's charting application commonly uses the * symbol on futures contracts as a shortcut to specify the month. For example, ZC*1 will return the front month, ZC*2 returns the second month out, ZC*3 returns the third month out, etc. When creating a custom expression using futures contracts, you must use parentheses to group the order of the calculation in the expression:  (ZC*1+ZC*2+ZC*3)/3 will add the front, second and third months for Corn, then divide the result by three. (ZCZ0+ZCH11+ZCK11)/3 will add December 2010 Corn, March 2011 Corn and May 2011 Corn together, then divide the results by three. (ZC*1)*2+(ZC*3)*2 will multiply the front month for Corn by 2, then add the result to the (third month out for Corn multiplied by two). ZC*2*4 will take the second month out for Corn and multiply the price by 4.   Common Spreads: choose from a number of common commodity spreads. (the expression will be displayed once you've made a selection from the list.)  Create a Futures Spread: select up to three different commodities, including the month, year, multiplier and function (+ - / *) between the second and third leg. The expression will be built and displayed in the Expression field as you enter the different legs of the spread.   Comparison Chart  Select up to three symbols to compare against. This will generate a chart with the price data of the symbols overlayed. To produce a chart of percent changes between symbols, check the Percent Change box. The colors of the boxes (green, purple, red) indicate the color of the line that will be drawn on the chart for the symbol. You may also indicate whether to display that symbol's price scale on the left side of the chart (by default, prices will all display on the right side). Studies / Parameters Select the indicators you wish to add to the chart. To remove an indicator, click the red "delete" icon. To change an indicator's parameters, click on the indicator name.

PIMCO launches Flexible Credit Income Fund

Launches & Fundraising











PIMCO has launched the PIMCO Flexible Credit Income Fund, an interval fund that aims to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and current income by investing across global credit sectors, including consumer, corporate, emerging market, mortgage and municipal bonds.
The fund will be managed by a team of portfolio managers based in Newport Beach, New York and London.
 
The interval fund structure combines certain attributes of a closed end fund and a traditional mutual fund. As an unlisted closed-end fund, it looks to provide greater flexibility in targeting potentially higher returning, less liquid assets while offering the fund enhanced liquidity protection* should markets become stressed. The fund has greater flexibility to invest in illiquid securities and assets than open-end mutual funds.
 
Similar to a mutual fund, the fund is continuously offered. Additionally, investors can sell their shares back to the fund, although unlike the daily liquidity of a mutual fund, they may only be able to do so on a quarterly basis through repurchase offers (currently expected to be at 5 per cent of outstanding shares). 
 
“In a low yielding environment, it is increasingly important to have the flexibility and resources to invest in both the public and private credit markets,” says Alfred Murata, managing director and portfolio manager. “We believe the flexibility of an interval fund structure allows investors to seek to capitalise on dislocations across global credit markets while remaining flexible to better navigate periods of short-term volatility.”
 
The PIMCO Flexible Credit Income Fund is the firm’s first interval fund. The structure expands access to the flexible, opportunistic credit capabilities that PIMCO already deploys in its private credit vehicles.
 
Murata; Dan Ivascyn, managing director and group chief investment officer; Mark Kiesel, managing director and chief investment officer of global credit; Marc Seidner, managing director and chief investment officer of non-traditional strategies; Christian Stracke, managing director and global head of credit research; and Eve Tournier, executive vice president and head of European credit portfolio management, are jointly and primarily responsible for day-to-day management of the fund.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

TD Ameritrade


In the process of searching for a well-rounded broker, finding the right mix is no easy task. Trade costs, trade platforms, tools, research, and customer service all are important to investors.
After using a TD Ameritrade account, you cannot help but love the overall experience. The broker charges $6.95 per trade, almost twice that of some of the cheaper discount brokers. However, the value and quality delivered is so superior it easily justifies the higher price tag.
Commissions & Fees

While having access to 24/7 customer support, advanced trade platforms, ample research, real-time streaming quotes site wide and more is great; unfortunately, it is expensive. TD Ameritrade charges a flat rate of $6.95 per trade, with options costing $6.95, plus $.75 per contract.
Compared to other full-service brokers, TD Ameritrade is on par with ETRADE, but is more expensive than the rest, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Scottrade. In fact, considering margin costs, TD Ameritrade is the most expensive broker out of the 16 included in our 2017 Review.
TD AmeritradeE*TRADECharles SchwabFidelity Stock Trade Fee (flat)$6.95$6.95$4.95$4.95Options Base Fee$6.95$6.95$4.95$4.95Options Per Contract Fee$0.75$0.75$0.65$0.65Mutual Fund Trade Fee$49.99$19.99$76.00$49.95Broker Assisted Trades Fee$44.99$25.00$25.00$32.95Commission Free ETFs10113322991Commissions & Fees 2.5 Stars  2.5 Stars  3.5 Stars  3 Stars 
One bright spot is that TD Ameritrade offers 101 commission-free ETFs (Charles Schwab offers the most, with 229). The only caveat is that, with TD Ameritrade, any commission-free ETF that is sold within 30 days of purchase is subject to a short-term trading fee of $19.99.
UPDATE 03/06/17 – TD Ameritrade reduced its equity commissions. Equity trades, including stocks and ETFs, have been lowered to $6.95 per trade (previously $9.99). Since these new rates were announced after the 2017 Review was published, they are not incorporated into TD Ameritrade's star rating for this category. 
Customer Service

If having access to 24/7 customer support by phone and email is important to you, then TD Ameritrade has you covered. The broker posted fantastic results for phone and email during testing for our 2017 Review, finishing No. 1 and No. 3, respectively.
When it comes to support, the bottom line is that for a full-service broker, great customer service is expected, and TD Ameritrade delivers, regardless of the communication avenue.
During our phone tests, our average wait time was less than two minutes. The reps were very well trained. Every test call we made to TD Ameritrade, regardless of the day or time, was answered by a customer service agent who identified him/herself, provided a pleasant introduction, and always left us with a warm closing note (e.g., “Have a great day”). All our questions were always answered, so it was not surprising to see TD Ameritrade end up No. 1 for phone customer service out of 16 brokers.
Email testing was also a great experience. All our emails were returned within 12 hours, on average. In fact, in one test, TD Ameritrade responded to our multi-question support inquiry in a blazingly fast 11 minutes.  Customer service agents were clearly well trained, as email templates were consistent and thorough. Of all our eight email tests, two resulted in a “good” overall score, with the rest being “great.” TD Ameritrade finished third for email.
Live chat support is also offered, but only for clients seeking platform support while using thinkorswim, or for potential clients who navigate around the site long enough to trigger a live chat popup. Knowing how the web is evolving and how millennials prefer to communicate, I would like to see TD Ameritrade offer live chat support for all clients and potential clients. TD Ameritrade finished third for live chat.
When it comes to support, the bottom line is that for a full-service broker, great customer service is expected, and TD Ameritrade delivers, regardless of the communication avenue. TD Ameritrade finished first overall for Customer Service in our 2017 Review.
Research

Like its biggest competitors, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and ETRADE, TD Ameritrade has a substantial research offering. 
TD AmeritradeFidelity E*TRADEMerrill EdgeCharles SchwabEquity Research - Social Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes Equity Research - Metric Comparisons Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Yes Equity Research - Reports712438ETF Research - Reports Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes Mutual Fund Research - Reports Yes  No  Yes  Yes  Yes 
When I pulled up a quote for Apple (AAPL), I found a clean spread of relevant data, including seven different third-party research reports to choose from and read, which is the third highest number in the industry (Fidelity offers 12). The featured research report provider is ResearchTeam, which combines five research providers into one.

Providing clients quality research is an extremely competitive challenge. Of all the functionality provided on the website, I found TD Ameritrade had two outstanding functions: the Social Signals tab and the Peer Comparison tab. Powered by LikeFolio, Social Signals displays both a real-time streaming feed of algorithmically filtered brand-relevant tweets – which I found much better than seeing a list of recent StockTwits tweets – and a summary chart of the most-tweeted brands. Naturally, Social Signals is best used for consumer-focused brands such as Apple (AAPL) or Nike (NKE). In thinkorswim (covered further down) the data can be charted for deeper analysis.

On the Peer Comparison tab, investors find a clean customizable chart showing the stock’s performance against its closest competitors followed by a comparison table of relevant metrics. Included competitors can also be shown or hidden. Clean peer comparisons are not easy to do, which is where TD Ameritrade stands out. Metrics included in the table are relevant and pruned to the most important. Social Signals data is also tied in; however, I found this data did not appear each time I loaded the page, and data was missing for certain securities. Data was marked as “New” during my testing, so I imagine the data will be worked out in time.

Social Signals and peer comparisons aside, I also enjoyed the on-site charting functionality. With 34 different technical indicators (volume, MACD, RSI, etc.) and easy-to-read, big charts, the experience is as clean as you will find anywhere. I could even pop out the chart into its own window to expand it across my 24-inch monitor. The only downside to the experience is the lack of panning flexibility on the chart itself. Charting is driven by provider SunGard, and my recommendation to TD Ameritrade would be to check out ChartIQ instead.

For the price customers pay per trade, excellent research should be expected. When all 51 variables for Research are considered, TD Ameritrade lacks only two features: displaying the total number of holdings for ETFs, and a country allocation chart for Mutual Funds. Impressive, to say the least. TD Ameritrade finished third behind Fidelity and Charles Schwab for Research in 2017. 
Ease of Use

Making research a seamless experience is just one part of TD Ameritrade’s efforts to make its website easy to use. The site-wide quote bar streams real-time quotes – functionality that Charles Schwab, ETRADE, and Fidelity do not offer – and includes SnapTicket, a quick trade extension that allows stock and option orders to be placed from any page on the site.

TD Ameritrade also offers a fully customizable sidebar, My Dock, which allows clients to display up to 13 different modules. Modules can be resorted or placed into separate columns, allowing clients with wide-screen monitors to maximize their workflow. While clean and easy to use, I found myself leaving the sidebar collapsed and hidden away. Despite having a 24-inch monitor capable of maximizing the experience, I found it to be a distraction.

I had to dig deep to find flaws in TD Ameritrade’s client experience.
I had to dig deep to find flaws in TD Ameritrade’s client experience. After many hours of testing and comparing, I found two disappointing items that stood out: The My Account Overview experience and adding additional accounts. The default My Account page is data rich but poorly laid out and I found it to be a poor launching pad into my usual workflow. Enabling My Dock in the sidebar did little to patch the user experience. Charles Schwab Trade Source and Fidelity’s new fully responsive Accounts experience are both superior; I know TD Ameritrade can do better.

For managing multiple accounts, I found that each new account I created required a completely new username and password. Once established and logged in, I could then link the new account to my primary user ID. This is a subtle difference from other brokers where you can simply create and add a new brokerage account to your same ID with no trouble. Minor? Yes. However, for clients with multiple accounts, it can be a confusing experience first time through.
Pickiness aside, TD Ameritrade’s platforms (discussed next) have both casual and active traders covered and the same two-pronged approach is applied to mobile, where two separate apps are offered. No doubt, TD Ameritrade shines in the category Ease of Use.
Platforms & Tools

While there are many attractive features in TD Ameritrade, the broker's two platforms are its bread and butter. The flagship platform, thinkorswim, used to be a standalone broker until TD Ameritrade acquired it in 2009.
TD AmeritradeFidelity E*TRADEMerrill EdgeCharles SchwabDesktop Platform (Windows) Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes Charting - Indicators / Studies3701661187340Charting - Drawing Tools2222242215Option Chains - Total Columns3326396234Watch Lists - Total Fields4018013021694
Thinkorswim is designed for advanced traders who want complete flexibility and depth. Furthermore, it can be used by any client with no minimums or specific trade criteria required for access. This is an important advantage over both Fidelity Active Trader Pro and ETRADE Pro, which both require minimums for access.

Run as a desktop application, thinkorswim is so advanced it is rivaled only by TradeStation. A few clicks of the mouse will have dozens of charts streaming real-time data, and even the pickiest trader will be satisfied with the 300+ technical studies available for each chart (highest in the industry), not to mention that each study can be customized thereafter.

Using thinkScript, thinkorswim’s proprietary coding language, traders can even create their own indicators. This is most like TradeStation’s EasyLanguage, which is the only other broker to offer such functionality.
It’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way.
TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim is also home to a slew of advanced tools. Whether it be company profiling, advanced earnings analysis, plotting FRED data, charting social sentiment, backtesting and replaying historical markets tick by tick, viewing economic and corporate calendars, creating and conducting real-time stock scans, sharing charts and workspace layouts, or performing advanced options analysis, the rabbit hole goes as far as any trader's imagination will take them. It’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way.

Focusing on the two most recent innovations, adding Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and the new earnings analysis tool, investors can begin to appreciate the endless brain hub stationed at thinkorswim’s Chicago office. Starting with FRED, a publicly accessible US Government database of over 400,000 economic data points; think GDP, CPI, treasury rates, median household income, etc. FRED data is used by institutional investors, hedge funds, and other sophisticated trading operations. In its never-ending quest to level the playing field, the thinkorswim team decided to download all the data, process it, build a custom interface to graph it, and brought it to all TD Ameritrade clients free.

Make no mistake, what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing. The only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a Bloomberg terminal.
Make no mistake, what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing. The only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a Bloomberg terminal. Once a data set is loaded, it can be tweaked and customized, whichever way the user desires. For sophisticated investors, FRED data is extremely useful in assessing the overall health of the market or specific sectors, which is why institutions pay up to access it via Bloomberg. Thanks to thinkorswim, now any TD Ameritrade client can conduct the same analysis.
Alongside FRED analysis, thinkorswim also launched its new tool for conducting earnings analysis. In my personal trading career, I have analyzed thousands of earnings releases. Heading into an earnings event, the toughest and most time-consuming part is researching historical price action and volatility surrounding previous events, understanding how the earnings were estimated in the eyes of Wall Street, then gauging the significance of any beat or miss. Earnings analysis with thinkorswim does all of this in one clean interface.

Starting with the top row, five days of price action are plotted before and after each earnings release. Next, volatility is plotted over the same time span followed by an At The Money (ATM) straddle (extremely insightful data for options traders seeking patterns and outliers in options market behavior). Finally, using data from Wall Street analysts and crowd-sourced ratings from Estimize, EPS estimate ranges alongside actual results are clearly plotted, providing an efficient way of assessing the company’s results. The whole experience together brings clarity with much less noise. It’s magic.
Both FRED data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in 2016 are two examples of many where TD Ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders.
Both FRED data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in 2016 are two examples of many where TD Ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders. For casual and active traders, earnings analysis with thinkorswim is truly a work of art and the best new trader tool of 2017 in my books.
One of my gripes with thinkorswim back in 2013 and 2014 was the platform’s reliability during volatile markets. On highly volatile and active trading days when there would be a large influx of clients using the system, thinkorswim would lag noticeably – sometimes for lengthy periods. Growing pains are no fun, and while it took longer than clients had hoped for, thinkorswim addressed them all. Today, thanks to the thinkorswim reskin in 2015, alongside a slew of infrastructure updates in both 2015 and 2016, thinkorswim hums along with no trouble at all. In 2017, active traders should be confident relying on thinkorswim to provide a seamless experience, regardless of the market environment.
Platform thinkorswim aside, TD Ameritrade also has a web-based platform, Trade Architect, which is designed with more casual investors in mind. The tools and functionality are purposely kept simple, and the design is clean with visual flare. Everything ran smoothly in my Chrome browser, bug-free, and I quickly became a fan of the platform-wide streaming real-time quotes.

From testing every broker, the streaming watch list functionality Trade Architect offers is my favorite. It isn't just the superb layout, but also the flexibility, ease of use, and depth of data available. The layout is completely customizable, and it’s great having access to visual data such as quote trends, trade trends, 52-week range, and a strength meter.

The bottom line is simple: when it comes to Platforms & Tools in 2017, for the sixth year in a row, TD Ameritrade is on top.
Mobile Trading

With mobile trading, TD Ameritrade took a different approach by offering not one, but two smartphone apps: TD Ameritrade Mobile and TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader. TD Ameritrade Mobile is designed for new and casual investors, while TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader is designed for the feature-hungry active trader.
Having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons.
Having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons. On the pros side, the apps can hone in on their individual target users and provide a specific experience. On the cons side, it is easy to confuse the two apps initially and not know which one is right for you. Also, some of the functionality that is built for one could really be beneficial on the other, for example basic price alerts, so it can be tricky at times to find the right home as a client.

Looking at specific functionality, TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader is “where the magic happens,” so to speak. Advanced charting, with a staggering 328 different technical studies, is available alongside a full array of order options. An extremely smooth interface for advanced equities trades as well as a seamless experience for complex options trades are compelling features. In my view, this combination is the best in the industry.

In 2015, TD Ameritrade released in-app chat support and mobile desktop linking, both for the Mobile Trader app. In-app chat support allows users to use their mobile devices and chat with a customer service agent for live help, which includes screen sharing. Linking enables users to link the thinkorswim desktop platform to the Mobile Trader app. Click on the quotes tab, select a color next to the search bar that matches a chart or similar in thinkorswim, then pull up any quote, and thinkorswim will follow suite.
In 2016, the updates were across the board. With TD Ameritrade Mobile, highlights included Touch ID login alongside customized positions and watch list views, and the addition of Social Signals analysis. A Windows 10 app was also launched. For Mobile Trader, access to saved orders was added with deeper linking to thinkorswim desktop.

It would be great to see screening and advanced alerts added to TD Ameritrade’s Mobile Trader in 2017. In TD Ameritrade Mobile, it would also be nice to be able to chart portfolio performance against the overall market and be able to set basic price alerts.
When all 52 variables are factored in for the Mobile Trading category, TD Ameritrade came away with 95% of possible points in our 2017 Review, edging out long-time industry leader E*TRADE, and taking first place overall.

Other Notes
Regarding TD Ameritrade’s educational offering, the company was again the only broker to ace the category in our 2017 Review and receive a perfect five-star rating. Over 200 videos are available, including endless education webinars and articles through thinkMoney magazine and The Ticker Tape. Content is organized into courses with quizzes and the chance to earn points alongside badges to encourage further learning.

TD Ameritrade also extends education into colleges across the United States with its annual thinkorswim Challenge. October 2016 was the third challenge, in which 726 teams across 49 states competed.
Finally yet importantly, TD Ameritrade entered the robo advisor space in 2016 with the launch of TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios. Read our full review of TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios.
Final Thoughts
TD Ameritrade is one of those companies that just gets it. They understand their clients and the value of a high-quality user experience, and they know what it takes to stay ahead of the competition.
Any investor, new or seasoned, will find TD Ameritrade a great fit for their needs. The main gripe with the broker is cost, but what you pay for is what you get, and the quality delivered by TD Ameritrade is, undoubtedly worth the extra few dollars per trade.
For online investing and trading in 2017, TD Ameritrade ranks #1 Overall.
Methodology
For our 2017 Stock Broker Review we assessed, rated, and ranked sixteen different online brokers over a period of six months. In total, we conducted 349 customer service tests, collected 5,277 data points, and produced over 40,000 words of research. How we test.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
