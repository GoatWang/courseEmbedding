A solution by Bsquare Introducing DataV
A complete IoT software stack for business & industrial applications 






IoT is a Progression
Don’t adopt IoT for IoT’s sake. Instead, focus on specific business
use cases and outcomes, using IoT as the basis for an overall strategy to achieve those
goals. It’s important to look at IoT not just as a journey but as a progression
as organizational needs and adoption changes.
Bsquare’s experience has shown that moving along the path to full IoT can be broken down into five stages. Each stage provides increasing levels of benefits. Progression through all five stages culminates in a holistic, intelligent, automated IoT system that delivers the broadest range of positive outcomes for multiple business goals, click here to learn more.

Read Our New DataV Case Studies









DataV is a complete Internet of Things (IoT) software solution allowing business and industrial concerns to use data generated by myriad connected devices in order to drive better business outcomes.

What are IoT Use Cases?
IoT use cases are the application of IoT technology in service of larger business objectives. Examples include predictive failure, adaptive diagnostics, IoT device management, condition-based management, asset optimization, and asset utilization. To varying degrees, these use cases can help organizations reduce costs and/or increase revenue.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Bsquare Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results
Q4 Revenue $26.8 million; Full Year Revenue $97.4 million; Cash balance up by $3.2 million during 2016
 
Bellevue, Wash., – February 21, 2017 – BSQUARE Corporation (NASDAQ: BSQR) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. 
 
Jerry Chase, Bsquare President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During 2016 we saw a successful launch of DataV, our new Internet of Things (IoT) proprietary software offering, with PACCAR, Inc., a global Fortune 500 transportation company and Itron, Inc., a world-leading technology and services provider. We also delivered solid results from our traditional third-party software business and optimized our engineering services business to support both DataV and our traditional services customers.”
Mr. Chase continued, “Given our recent successes with DataV and the strength of our pipeline, we will continue targeted investments in sales and marketing, research and development, and in building an enterprise-class product support and integration services team to ensure customer success.”  
 
Mr. Chase concluded, “We experienced strong cash flow in 2016, partly as a result of our success with DataV, increasing cash by $3.2 million during the year. We anticipate continued DataV customer traction in 2017 but believe that it will not occur uniformly throughout the year. Further, given the ability of DataV to support multiple licensing and deployment options, we expect varying revenue recognition patterns in 2017. We have built a strong base from which to grow and to further enhance shareholder value.”
Q4 2016 Financial Highlights
 
Total revenue for the quarter was $26.8 million, up 19% compared to the third quarter of 2016, and up 7% from the prior year period. Net loss for the quarter was $1.3 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to net loss of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2016 and net income of $1.1 million, or $0.09 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDAS* for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a negative $0.8 million, compared to break-even in the third quarter of 2016 and a positive $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our cash and investments increased to $33.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.
 
As previously disclosed, we initiated a restructuring plan in July 2016 reducing the size of our engineering services organization. These actions and the resulting severance and restructuring costs negatively impacted our Q3, Q4 and full year results, and they were mostly completed during the third quarter of 2016. We incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of $831,000 in the third quarter of 2016 and $154,000 in the fourth quarter.

A solution by Bsquare Introducing DataV
A complete IoT software stack for business & industrial applications 






IoT is a Progression
Don’t adopt IoT for IoT’s sake. Instead, focus on specific business
use cases and outcomes, using IoT as the basis for an overall strategy to achieve those
goals. It’s important to look at IoT not just as a journey but as a progression
as organizational needs and adoption changes.
Bsquare’s experience has shown that moving along the path to full IoT can be broken down into five stages. Each stage provides increasing levels of benefits. Progression through all five stages culminates in a holistic, intelligent, automated IoT system that delivers the broadest range of positive outcomes for multiple business goals, click here to learn more.









 

Device Connectivity & Data ForwardingSensor data is transmitted and stored for analysis and action.  




 

Real-Time MonitoringData is monitored and visualized to initiate use case for desired business outcomes. Achieves awareness of equipment status and refines business processes.

AutomationOrchestrates automated, complex actions from equipment to inventory, support, service ticketing and other systems to enable condition-based maintenance and better device utilization. 




 

Enhancing On-Board IntelligenceProvides maximum ROI and business benefit from predictive failure, data driven-diagnostics and device optimization.
