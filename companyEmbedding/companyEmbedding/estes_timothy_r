ESTES, TIMOTHY R
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Vermont:













Does Estes, Timothy R carry a valid contracting license?



The state of Vermont does not offer licenses for contractors working on residential or commercial construction projects.











Your liability risk when hiring Estes, Timothy R



Contractors are not required by the state to carry general liability or workers compensation insurance. When hiring a contractor for any type of construction or remodeling work, it is always a good idea to only hire contractors with general liability and workers compensation insurance. Request a copy of the insurance certificates for each before any work starts. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



Because Vermont does not have licensing requirements for contractors,homeowners need to approach all home improvement projects with an extra level of caution.When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims.BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Vermont, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Batten riser assembly



Patent number:  7386962
                                            

Abstract:  Disclosed is a batten riser assembly that is used to install battens for tile roofs. The batten riser assembly can be used to prolong the life of tile roofs since it is made of waterproof materials. The batten riser assembly uses flexible strips that can be easily folded in a compact package and can be installed in a quick and easy manner. The batten riser assembly can be used in conjunction with a marker tape to speed installation. The batten riser assembly is designed to prevent the damming of water that penetrates the tile roof. The batten riser assembly provides a simple and easy way for installers to comply with building codes.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
