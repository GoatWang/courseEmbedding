About
About Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc.
Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 24, 2015. We were incorporated and our business plan called for Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. to seek out and acquire various mining assets in the State of Nevada. Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. is a precious metals exploration and development company with the objective of becoming a gold producer. Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. is currently focused on the advancement of its two principal projects: the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims.
Land rights
Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. now owns land and patented mining rights North of Elko, Nevada, near the formation that is known as the Carlin Trend. The Carlin Trend is the second-largest known gold resource in the world and has produced over 70 million ounces of gold. Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc.'s property includes two patented claims - the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims - comprising what is known as the Prunty Mine Area.
A Historical Look Back
In 1912, Dr. Pinkard Prunty purchased 1,200 acres of Nevada wilderness from the then-future President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. Gold was discovered on the land soon after. Dr. Prunty immediately employed day workers with pick axes to begin extraction, and over the next decades purchased an additional 120,000 acres with his gold revenues. After his death, the property passed to his children, who continued to successfully mine gold on the property with pick-axes. In 1979, family member Charles Leavitt reviewed the mine's books and uncovered the fact that revenues had been mishandled, this lead to a dispute and the family closing the mine in 1980.
Since then, David Leavitt inherited the land and the associated patented mining claims on the property. Leavitt was the Chairman of Humboldt Mining Company, Inc.
Humboldt Mining was acquired by Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. in July of 2015 for the purpose of developing the claims.

Our offering is being made in a direct public offering without the involvement
of underwriters or broker-dealers. We intend to disburse the proceeds from this
offering in the priority set forth below within the first 12 months after
successful completion of this offering.

Not taking into account any possible additional funding or revenues, we intend
to use the proceeds from this offering as follows. The following chart indicates
the approximate amount of funds that we will allocate to each item, but does not
indicate the total fee/cost of each item. The amount of proceeds we allocate to
each item is dependent upon the amount of proceeds we receive from this
offering:

If we sell all of the Shares being offered, our net proceeds will be
$10,000,000. We will use the net proceeds to pay development costs and to hold
and maintain the asset rights, as well as complete reserve reports to guide
mining efforts and secure optimum profit streams on the mining output. Such
efforts will continue until we become cash-flow positive. The precise amounts
that the Company will devote to each of these items and the timing of
expenditures will vary depending on numerous factors including, but not limited
to, the progress of development efforts relating to each project. The following
table sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net proceeds as we
currently expect to use them, assuming the sale of 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% of the
Shares offered for sale in this offering:

Assumed Percentage of Shares Sold           100%             75%             50%             25%          
Price to Public                             $ 10,000,000     $ 7,500,000     $ 5,000,000     $ 2,500,000  
Other offering expenses                           82,900          82,900          82,900          82,900  
Net proceeds                                $  9,917,100     $ 7,417,100     $ 4,917,100     $ 2,417,100  
                                                                                                          
Project development and commercialization   $  1,150,000     $ 1,150,000     $ 1,150,000     $   650,000  
Operating expenses                             1,000,000       1,000,000       1,000,000       1,000,000  
Working capital                                  350,000         350,000         350,000         350,000  
Total use of proceeds                       $  2,500,000     $ 2,500,000     $ 2,500,000     $ 2,000,000  

As indicated in the table above, if we sell only 75%, or 50%, or 25% of the
Shares offered for sale in this offering, we would expect to use the resulting
net proceeds for the same purposes as we would use the net proceeds from a sale
of 100% of the Shares, and in approximately the same proportions. However, the
lower our net proceeds, the less we would expect to use the funds in the
expenditure category “Development and Commercialization”, and the more we would
expect to use those funds for the development and commercialization of the
assets we have acquired. As can be seen in the table, the only expenditure that
changes relative to the proceeds received in the offering is the “Development
and Commercialization” expenditures forecasted under the circumstance where
proceeds received only represent 25% of the offering. Expenses that fall under
“Development and Commercialization” include the development of additional mining
claims, held within the Prunty Mine Area by the Company which management feels
would be productive in terms of adding to the existing reserve base. The reason
why only this expenditure is adjusted in the event only 25% of the target
offering proceeds are raised is because the development of additional claims
represented by this expenditure are ancillary to the Company’s main initial
objective of developing its deposits.

In the event we do not sell all of the Shares being offered, we may seek
additional financing to support the intended use of proceeds discussed above. If
we secure additional equity funding, investors in this offering would be
diluted. In all events, there can be no assurance that additional financing
would be available when needed and, if available, on terms acceptable to us.


The mining industry is very competitive. Much of our competition is from larger,
established mining companies with greater liquidity, greater access to credit
and other financial resources, newer or more efficient equipment, lower cost
structures, more effective risk management policies and procedures and/or a
greater ability than us to withstand losses. Our competitors may be able to
respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, and
devote greater resources to the expansion or efficiency of their operations. In
addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or
establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.
Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and
new competitors may emerge and gain significant market share to our detriment.
We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future
competitors, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, or results of operations.


Company Description
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 24, 2015. We were
incorporated and our business plan called for the Company to seek out and
acquire various mining assets in the State of Nevada. Rancho Santa Fe Mining
Inc. is a precious metals exploration and development company with the


 objective
of becoming a gold producer. The Company is currently focused on the advancement
of its two principal projects: the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims.

On October 28, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the
“Asset Purchase”) with Humboldt Mining Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation
(“HMCI”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of
the assets owned by HMCI, including, but not limited to: (i) all the real
property, leasehold improvements, fixtures, furniture, machinery and equipment
owned by the HMCI and relating to or used in HMCI’s operations; and, (ii) all
inventory, including finished goods, raw materials and work in process as well
as the right to receive inventory ordered by the HMCI for use in its operations;
and, (iii) in addition to the foregoing, we acquired all the books and records
of HMCI, as well as all intangible assets held, owned or controlled by HMCI
(collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to hereinafter as the “Acquired
Assets”). As per the Asset Purchase we acquired various liabilities of HMCI,
including: (i) the assumption of all liabilities arising out of any unfilled
customer orders outstanding as of the date the Asset Purchase closed. The
Company is entitled to any future payments relating to any payments made
pursuant thereto; (ii) the assumption of obligations relating to a lawsuit and
default judgment, including, but not limited to the obligation to pay attorneys’
fees of approximately $20,000.00, and, (iii) inherited HMCI’s reclamation
liability, if any, as it is related to the property. There are no royalties due
or owing on the purchased claims. The only amounts due are local property taxes,
which are assessed annually.
---

The Company now owns land and the patented mining rights North of Elko, Nevada,
nearby the formation known as the Carlin Trend. The Company’s property includes
two patented claims – the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims - comprising
what is known as the Prunty Mine Area (Vanity Fair, Virginia, 3871 Mining Survey
Number). The 2 patented mining claims (Prunty Mine – Virginia and Vanity Fair
Patents) total approximately 40 acres. The importance of these patented claims
cannot be underestimated. In accordance with the Apex Rule in Mining, along the
primary axis of the claims the Company is allowed to follow and continue mining
the Prunty Mine area beyond the properties presently owned by the Company, even
if following that mining axis extends beyond the patented claim. We leased the
Patented Mining Claims and the mineral rights associated with the Patents have
no expiration date, subject to property taxes being paid on the property.

Operationally, the Company intends to outsource fully 100% of the exploration,
site preparation and extraction operations to a third party who provides all
manpower, equipment and operational expenses associated therewith. Insomuch as
this work will be outsourced and the Company income will be based on profits
from the sale of gold recovered by the contractors received therefrom, the
Company cannot speak to the outsourced expenditures related to exploration, site
preparation and extraction.

Our executive offices are located at 9655 Granite Ridge Drive, Suite 200, San
Diego, CA 92123. Telephone number: 858.717.8090.

 Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. (Form: 424B3, Received: 10/28/2016 11:24:42) 


















	Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)



	Registration No. 333-208550



	PROSPECTUS


	 



	20,000,000 Shares

	of Common Stock



	 



	Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc.




	 




	 




	This
	is the initial offering of Common Stock of Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. (the “Company”). We are offering for sale
	a total of 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock at a fixed price of $0.50 per share for the duration of this Offering (the “Offering”). This
	offering also includes up to 6,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock offered by selling shareholders as herein further
	detailed. Our Common Stock is presently not traded on any market or securities exchange. The selling security holders have not
	engaged any underwriter in connection with the sale of their shares of Common Stock.  Common Stock being registered
	in this Registration Statement may be sold by selling security holders at a fixed price of $0.50 per share until our Common Stock
	is quoted on the OTCQB and thereafter at a prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices or in transactions that
	are not in the public market. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with OTCQB,
	nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. We have agreed to bear the expenses
	relating to the registration of the shares of the selling security holders.






	 




	There
	is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the Offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from
	the sale of any of the offered shares. The Offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which
	means our Officers and Directors will attempt to sell the shares directly to friends, family members and business acquaintances.
	Our Officers and Directors will not receive commissions or any other remuneration from any such sales. In offering the securities
	on our behalf, our Officers and Directors will rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1, promulgated
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides
	an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate
	in the sale of the securities of such issuer. We are an “emerging growth company” under applicable Securities
	and Exchange Commission rules and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.




	 




	The
	shares will be offered for sale at a fixed price of $0.50 per share for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days from the
	effective date of this Prospectus, unless extended by our Board of Directors for an additional 90 days. If all of the shares offered
	by us are purchased, the gross proceeds to us will be $10,000,000.00.  All funds raised hereunder will become immediately
	available to the Company and will be used in accordance with the Company’s intended “Use of Proceeds” as set
	forth herein. Investors are advised that they will not be entitled to a refund and could lose their entire investment.




	 




	The
	Company is a development stage company and currently has limited operations. Any investment in the shares offered herein
	involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford a loss of your investment. Our independent
	registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for the Company, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt
	as to our ability to continue as a going concern.




	 

	 




	This
	Prospectus covers the primary public offering by the Company of 20,000,000


	shares of Common Stock. The Company is concurrently
	conducting a resale offering for 6,750,000


	shares of Common Stock, which is covered in a separate Resale Prospectus.





	 





	THE PURCHASE
	OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDER
	THE SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS ENTITLED “RISK FACTORS” BEFORE BUYING ANY SHARES OF RANCHO SANTA FE’S COMMON
	STOCK.






	 






	NEITHER THE
	SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED
	UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.





	 





	No dealer, salesperson
	or any other person is authorized to give any information or make any representations in connection with this offering other than
	those contained in this Prospectus and, if given or made, the information or representations must not be relied upon as having
	been authorized by us. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security
	other than the securities offered by this Prospectus, or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities
	by anyone in any jurisdiction in which the offer or solicitation is not authorized or is unlawful.

	the information you should consider before investing in our common stock. Before making an investment decision, you should read
	the entire prospectus carefully, including the “Risk Factors” section, the “Management’s Discussion and
	Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section, the financial statements and the notes to the financial
	statements. You should also review the other available information referred to in the section entitled “Where You Can Find
	More Information” in this prospectus and any amendment or supplement hereto. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms
	the “Company,” “Rancho Santa Fe Mining,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer
	and relate to Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc.





	 





	The Company
	Overview





	 




	The
	Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 24, 2015. We were incorporated and our business plan called for
	the Company to seek out and acquire various mining assets in the State of Nevada. Rancho Santa Fe Mining Inc. is a precious metals
	exploration and development company with the objective of becoming a gold producer. The Company is currently focused on the advancement
	of its two principal projects: the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims.




	 





	On October 28, 2015, the
	Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase”) with Humboldt Mining Company, Inc., a Nevada
	corporation (“HMCI”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the assets owned by HMCI,
	including, but not limited to: (i) all the real property, leasehold improvements, fixtures, furniture, machinery and equipment
	owned by the HMCI and relating to or used in HMCI’s operations; and, (ii) all inventory, including finished goods, raw materials
	and work in process as well as the right to receive inventory ordered by the HMCI for use in its operations; and, (iii) in addition
	to the foregoing, we acquired all the books and records of HMCI, as well as all intangible assets held, owned or controlled by
	HMCI (collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to hereinafter as the “Acquired Assets”). As per the Asset
	Purchase we acquired various liabilities of HMCI, including: (i) the assumption of all liabilities arising out of any unfilled
	customer orders outstanding as of the date the Asset Purchase closed. The Company is entitled to any future payments relating
	to any payments made pursuant thereto; (ii) the assumption of obligations relating to a lawsuit and default judgment, including,
	but not limited to the obligation to pay attorneys’ fees of approximately $20,000.00, and, (iii)

	inherited HMCI’s reclamation liability, if any, as it is related to the property.

	There are no royalties due
	or owing on the purchased claims. The only amounts due are local property taxes, which are assessed annually.


	 


	In exchange for the Acquired
	Assets, the Company issued to the HMCI shareholders Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand (13,500,000) shares of the Company’s
	$0.001 par value common stock, which represented fifty (50%) percent of the Company’s issued and outstanding
	shares at the time of issuance.


	 


	The Company now owns land
	and the patented mining rights North of Elko, Nevada, nearby the formation known as the Carlin Trend. The Company’s property
	includes two patented claims – the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims - comprising what is known as the Prunty Mine
	Area (Vanity Fair, Virginia,

	3871 Mining Survey Number

	). The 2 patented mining claims (Prunty Mine – Virginia and
	Vanity Fair Patents) total approximately 40 acres. The importance of these patented claims cannot be underestimated. We own
	the Patented Mining Claims and the mineral rights associated with the Patents have no expiration date, subject to property
	taxes being paid on the property.


	 


	Operationally, the Company
	intends to outsource fully 100% of the exploration, site preparation and extraction operations to a third party who provides all
	manpower, equipment and operational expenses associated therewith. Insomuch as this work will be outsourced and the Company income
	will be based on profits from the sale of gold recovered by the contractors received therefrom, the Company cannot speak to the
	outsourced expenditures related to exploration, site preparation and extraction.


	 


	As such, the proceeds
	will largely be utilized for payroll, outsourced consultants and asset maintenance and development. The Company plans to retain
	five full time staff and lease nominal executive office facilities in Nevada. All legal, accounting, shareholder
	relations and geology can be outsourced to consultants as needed. Business development is limited to developing
	and maintaining a website presence, and nominal travel and business entertainment expense. The primary additional operations entail
	asset development, which includes the maintenance of applicable permits and claim renewals, as well as the outsourced production
	of independent Reserve Reports annually.

	Emerging
	Growth Company






	 





	We
	are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an emerging
	growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain regulatory requirements applicable to other public companies that
	are not emerging gr


	owth companies, including but not limited to: not being required to comply
	with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; being permitted to comply with reduced disclosure
	obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and being exempt from the requirements
	of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and securing stockholder approval of golden parachute payments.
	We intend to take advantage of these reduced regulatory requirements until we are no longer an emerging growth company. For a
	description of the qualifications and other requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, and certain elections we have
	made due to our status as an emerging growth company, see “Risk Factors— As an ‘emerging growth company’
	under applicable law, we will be subject to reduced disclosure requirements, which could leave our stockholders without information
	or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies”.





	 












	RISK FACTORS







	 






	An
	investment in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the
	other information in this Prospectus before investing in our Common Stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business,
	operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. Currently, shares of our Common Stock are not publicly traded.
	In the event that shares of our Common Stock become publicly traded, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline due to
	any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In the event our Common Stock fails to become publicly traded,
	you may lose all or part of your investment.







	 








	RISKS RELATED
	TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY






	 






	We are an
	exploration stage company and may never be able to carry out business or achieve any revenues or profitability; at this stage,
	even with good faith efforts, potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment.






	 




	We
	have not earned any revenues as of the date of this current report. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally
	encountered by new mineral exploration companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must
	be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the exploration
	of the mineral properties that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems
	relating to exploration and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates.




	 




	There
	is nothing at this time on which to base an assumption that our business operations will prove to be successful or that we will
	ever be able to operate profitably. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues.
	We therefore expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that we will ever achieve
	any revenues or profitability. The revenue and income potential of our proposed business and operations is unproven as the lack
	of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the future prospects of our business.




	 






	We are dependent
	on our two principal projects for our future operating revenue, neither of which currently has proven or probable reserves.






	 




	The
	Virginia and the Vanity Fair Project do not have identified proven and probable mineral reserves. The costs, timing and complexities
	of upgrading either property to proven and probable reserves may be greater than we anticipate. Mineral exploration and development
	involves a high degree of risk that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge cannot eliminate, and few
	properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. There is no assurance that our mineral exploration
	programs will establish the presence of any proven or probable mineral reserves. The failure to establish proven or probable reserves
	would severely restrict our ability to implement our strategies for long-term growth.




	 
















	8










	 









	We cannot
	be certain that our acquisition, exploration and evaluation activities will be commercially successful.






	 




	We
	currently have no properties that produce gold in commercial quantities. Substantial expenditures are required to acquire existing
	mining properties, to establish ore reserves through drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal
	from the ore and, in the case of new properties, to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site
	chosen for mining. We cannot provide assurance that any gold or other metal reserves or mineralized material acquired or discovered
	will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on
	a timely basis. Factors including costs, actual mineralization, consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity prices
	affect successful project development, could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.






	 








	Actual capital
	costs, operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those we have anticipated and there are
	no assurances that any future development activities will result in profitable mining operations.






	 




	The
	capital costs to take our claims into production may be significantly higher than anticipated. We may ultimately base our decisions
	about the development of the projects based on a feasibility study. We have not prepared a feasibility study for the either, but
	we may use a portion of the proceeds of the offering to produce one if we deem it necessary or appropriate to do so. Our evaluations
	of our business and prospects are subject to change, including after any feasibility study has been conducted, which could materially
	adversely affect our prospects.




	  






	Historical
	production at either of our claims may not be indicative of the potential for future development.






	 




	There
	is currently no commercial production at either claim and, since acquiring ownership, we have never recorded any revenues
	from commercial production. You should not rely on the fact that there were historical mining operations at the either claim as
	an indication that we will ever have future successful commercial operations. In order for us to develop new mining operations,
	we will be required to incur substantial operating expenses and capital expenditures to refurbish and/or replace existing infrastructure.






	 








	Land reclamation
	and mine closure may be burdensome and costly.






	 




	Land
	reclamation and mine closure requirements are generally imposed on mineral exploration companies, which require us to,
	among other things, to minimize the effects of land disturbance. Such requirements may include controlling the discharge of potentially
	dangerous effluents from a site and restoring a site’s landscape to its pre-exploration form. The actual costs of reclamation
	and mine closure are uncertain and planned expenditures may differ from the actual expenditures required. Therefore, the amount
	that we are required to spend could be materially higher than current estimates. Any additional amounts required to be spent on
	reclamation and mine closure may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, financial position and results of
	operations, and may cause us to alter our operations. In addition, we are required to maintain financial assurances, such
	as letters of credit, to secure reclamation obligations under certain laws and regulations. The failure to acquire, maintain or
	renew such financial assurances could subject us to fines, penalties, or suspension of our operations. Additionally,
	even if we cease exploration at either claim, we will be required to expend cash and other resources to satisfy ongoing
	care and maintenance obligations.




	 










	Our operations
	involve significant risks and hazards inherent to the mining industry.






	 




	Our
	operations involve the operation of large pieces of drilling and other heavy equipment. Hazards such as fire, explosion, floods,
	structural collapses, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, ground control problems, cave-ins, flooding
	and mechanical equipment failure are inherent risks in our operations. Hazards inherent to the mining industry can cause injuries
	or death to employees, contractors or other persons at our mineral properties, severe damage to and destruction of our property,
	plant and equipment and mineral properties, and contamination of, or damage to, the environment, and can result in the suspension
	of our exploration activities and any future development and production activities. While the Company aims to maintain best safety
	practices as part of its culture, safety measures implemented by us may not be successful in preventing or mitigating future accidents.

	The mining
	industry is very competitive.






	 




	The
	mining industry is very competitive. Much of our competition is from larger, established mining companies with greater liquidity,
	greater access to credit and other financial resources, newer or more efficient equipment, lower cost structures, more effective
	risk management policies and procedures and/or a greater ability than us to withstand losses. Our competitors may be able to respond
	more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, and devote greater resources to the expansion or efficiency
	of their operations. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships
	among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors
	may emerge and gain significant market share to our detriment. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and
	future competitors, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
	or results of operations.




	 






	Mining exploration,
	development and operating activities are inherently hazardous.






	 




	Mineral
	exploration involves many risks that even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome.
	Operations in which we have direct or indirect interests will be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration,
	development and production of gold and other metals, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to property and possible
	environmental damage. The nature of these risks is such that liabilities might exceed any liability insurance policy limits. It
	is also possible that the liabilities and hazards might not be insurable, or, that the Company could elect not to be insured against
	such liabilities due to high premium costs or other reasons, in which event, significant costs could be incurred that could have
	a material adverse effect on our financial condition.





	 







	Reserve calculations
	are estimates only, subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices, inherent variability of ore, and recoverability
	of metals in the mining process.






	 




	There
	is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves and corresponding grades dedicated to future production.
	Until reserves are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only. In addition,
	the quantity of reserves and ore may vary depending on metal prices. Any material change in the quantity of reserves, mineralization,
	grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties. In addition, there can be no assurance that gold
	recoveries or other metal recoveries in small-scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions
	or during production.






	 


	 






	We may be
	unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms.






	 




	The
	exploration and development of our development properties will require significant capital investment to achieve commercial production.
	We may have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to maintain and advance our existing property positions and
	to acquire new gold projects. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms
	and, if additional financing is not available, we may have to substantially reduce or cease operations.





	 







	Our exploration
	and eventual development operations are subject to environmental regulations which could result in the incurrence of additional
	costs and operational delays.






	 




	All
	phases of operations are subject to environmental regulation. Environmental legislation is evolving in some jurisdictions in a
	manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent
	environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors
	and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulations, if any, will not adversely affect the Company’s
	projects. We will be subject to environmental regulations with respect to properties in Nevada, under applicable federal and state
	laws and regulations. Production at either claim may involve the use of sodium cyanide, which is a toxic material. Should sodium
	cyanide leak or otherwise be discharged from the containment system, we may become subject to liability for cleanup work
	that may not be insured. While appropriate steps will be taken to prevent discharges of pollutants into the ground water and the
	environment, we may become subject to liability for hazards that it may not be insured against.






	 









	 



	10



	 







	 













	U.S. Federal
	Laws






	 




	Under
	the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, mining companies may incur costs for generating, transporting, treating, storing,
	or disposing of hazardous waste, as well as for closure and post-closure maintenance once they have completed mining activities
	on a property. Mining operations may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants, from stationary
	equipment, storage facilities, and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment which are subject
	to review, monitoring and/or control requirements under the Federal Clean Air Act and state air quality laws. Permitting rules
	may impose limitations on the Company’s production levels or create additional capital expenditures in order to comply with
	the rules.




	 




	The
	U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), imposes strict joint and
	several liability on parties associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances. The groups who could be
	found liable include, among others, the current owners and operators of facilities, which release hazardous substances into the
	environment and past owners and operators of properties who owned such properties at the time the disposal of the hazardous substances
	occurred. This liability could include the cost of removal or remediation of the release and damages for injury to the surrounding
	property. The Company cannot predict the potential for future CERCLA liability with respect to its properties.





	 







	Increased
	costs could affect our financial condition.







	 





	We
	anticipate that costs will frequently be subject to variation from one year to the next due to a number of factors, such as changing
	ore grade, metallurgy, and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition,
	costs are affected by the price of commodities, such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to
	volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. A material increase
	in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on profitability.





	 







	Difficult
	conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of
	operations.






	 




	Factors
	such as business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect
	the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized
	by higher unemployment, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment, our operations could be negatively impacted. Purchasers
	of gold production may delay or be unable to make timely payments. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively
	and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.





	 

	 






	A shortage
	of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.






	 




	We
	will be dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and development operations. The shortage
	of such supplies, equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore,
	limit or increase the cost of production.





	 







	If we lose
	key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel, we may be unable to establish and develop our business.






	 




	Our
	development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees. We do not have and currently have
	no plans to obtain key man insurance with respect to any key employees. We will need to recruit and retain other qualified
	managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such
	persons, then development and growth could be significantly curtailed.




	 






	Principal
	stockholders will be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval, which could delay
	or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the Board of Directors, possibly conflicting
	with the interests of other stockholders.






	 




	Major
	shareholders and the President’s position on the board of directors could exert significant influence in determining
	the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval and otherwise control of our business. This control could have
	the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or entrenching management or the board of directors, which
	could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and, consequently, could adversely affect the market price of our
	common stock.




	 
















	11










	 









	Our Articles
	of Incorporation exculpates our officers and directors from certain liability to our Company or our stockholders.






	 




	Our
	Articles of Incorporation contain a provision limiting the liability of our officers and directors for their acts or failures
	to act, except for acts involving intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This limitation on liability may
	reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors and may discourage or deter our stockholders
	from suing our officers and directors based upon breaches of their duties to our Company.




	 






	Our internal
	controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated
	to the public.






	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange
	Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal
	executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
	assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:




	 






	 




	·




	pertain to the maintenance of
	records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;






	 






	 




	·




	provide reasonable assurance
	that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
	of management and/or directors of the Company; and






	 






	 




	·




	provide reasonable assurance
	regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could
	have a material effect on the financial statements.






	 




	Our
	internal controls may be inadequate or ineffective, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation
	being disseminated to the public. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.









	 







	We have a
	“going concern” opinion from our auditors, indicating the possibility that we may not be able to continue to operate



	.





	 




	Our
	independent registered public accountants have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion
	could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. If we fail
	to raise sufficient capital when needed, we will not be able to complete our proposed business. As a result, we may have
	to liquidate our business and investors may lose their investment. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
	is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish its plan of operations described herein and eventually attain profitable
	operations. Investors should consider our independent registered public accountant’s comments when deciding whether to invest
	in the Company.

	RISKS RELATED
	TO THE OFFERING






	 






	The Company’s
	stock price may be volatile.






	 




	The
	market price of the Company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response
	to various potential factors, many of which will be beyond the Company’s control, including the following:




	 






	 




	·




	competition;






	 






	 




	·




	additions or departures of key
	personnel;






	 






	 




	·




	the Company’s ability to
	execute its business plan;






	 






	 




	·




	operating results that fall below
	expectations;






	 






	 




	·




	loss of any strategic relationship;






	 






	 




	·




	industry developments;






	 






	 




	·




	economic and other external factors;
	and






	 






	 




	·




	period-to-period fluctuations
	in the Company’s financial results.






	 




	In
	addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated
	to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market
	price of the Company’s common stock.




	 






	We do not
	expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.






	 




	We
	do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the
	development and growth of our business. Therefore, investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock, and
	stockholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms or at all. We cannot assure you of a positive return on investment
	or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.




	 






	We may in
	the future issue additional shares of our common stock which would reduce investors’ ownership interests in the Company
	and which may dilute our share value.






	 




	Our
	Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The future
	issuance of all or part of our remaining authorized common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common
	stock held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance
	of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the
	shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.




	 






	FINRA sales practice requirements
	may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.






	 




	The
	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) has adopted rules that relate to the application of the SEC’s
	penny stock rules in trading our securities and require that a broker/dealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment
	is suitable for that customer, prior to recommending the investment. Prior to recommending speculative, low priced securities
	to their non-institutional customers, broker/dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s
	financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information.




	 










	13










	 







	Under
	interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative, low priced securities will not
	be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA’s requirements make it more difficult for broker/dealers to recommend that
	their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our
	common stock. Further, many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions. As a result, fewer broker/dealers
	may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a shareholder’s ability to resell shares of our common stock.




	 










	DETERMINATION
	OF OFFERING PRICE






	 




	As
	a result of there being no established public market for our shares, the offering price and other terms and conditions relative
	to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by the Company and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value,
	or any other objective criteria of value. In addition, no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party has been
	consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares.






	 









	USE OF PROCEEDS






	 




	Our
	offering is being made in a direct public offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers. We intend to disburse
	the proceeds from this offering in the priority set forth below within the first 12 months after successful completion of this
	offering.




	 




	Not
	taking into account any possible additional funding or revenues, we intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows.
	The following chart indicates the approximate amount of funds that we will allocate to each item, but does not indicate the total
	fee/cost of each item.  The amount of proceeds we allocate to each item is dependent upon the amount of proceeds we receive
	from this offering:




	 




	If
	we sell all of the Shares being offered, our net proceeds will be $10,000,000. We will use the net proceeds to pay development
	costs and to hold and maintain the asset rights, as well as complete reserve reports to guide mining efforts and secure optimum
	profit streams on the mining output. Such efforts will continue until we become cash-flow positive. The precise
	amounts that the Company will devote to each of these items and the timing of expenditures will vary depending on numerous factors
	including, but not limited to, the progress of development efforts relating to each project. The following table
	sets forth a breakdown of the estimated use of the net proceeds as we currently expect to use them, assuming the sale of 100%,
	75%, 50% and 25% of the Shares offered for sale in this offering:

	As
	indicated in the table above, if we sell only 75%, or 50%, or 25% of the Shares offered for sale in this offering, we would
	expect to use the resulting net proceeds for the same purposes as we would use the net proceeds from a sale of 100% of the Shares,
	and in approximately the same proportions. However, the lower our net proceeds, the less we would expect to use the funds
	in the expenditure category “Development and Commercialization”, and the more we would expect to use those funds for
	the development and commercialization of the assets we have acquired.

	As can be seen in the table, the only expenditure
	that changes relative to the proceeds received in the offering is the “Development and Commercialization” expenditures
	forecasted under the circumstance where proceeds received only represent 25% of the offering. Expenses that fall under “Development
	and Commercialization” include the development of additional mining claims, held within the Prunty Mine Area by the Company
	which management feels would be productive in terms of adding to the existing reserve base. The reason why only this expenditure
	is adjusted in the event only 25% of the target offering proceeds are raised is because the development of additional claims represented
	by this expenditure are ancillary to the Company’s main initial objective of developing its deposits.



	 












	14










	 







	In
	the event we do not sell all of the Shares being offered, we may seek additional financing to support the intended use of proceeds
	discussed above. If we secure additional equity funding, investors in this offering would be diluted. In all events, there can
	be no assurance that additional financing would be available when needed and, if available, on terms acceptable to us.






	 













	DIVIDEND POLICY







	 





	We
	have not paid any dividends on our common stock since inception and we currently expect that, in the foreseeable future, all
	earnings (if any) will be retained for the development of our business and no dividends will be declared or paid. Any future dividends
	will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our earnings (if any), operating
	results, financial condition and capital requirements, general business conditions and other pertinent facts.





	 








	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION;
	TERMS OF THE OFFERING








	 




	Rancho
	Santa Fe Mining, Inc. has issued and outstanding as of the date of this Prospectus 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The
	Company is registering an additional 20,000,000 shares of its Common Stock for sale at the price of $0.50 per share. There is
	no arrangement to address the possible effect of the offering on the price of the stock. In connection with the Company’s
	selling efforts in the offering, our officers and directors will not register as broker-dealers pursuant to Section 15 of the
	Exchange Act, but rather will rely upon the “safe harbor” provisions of SEC Rule 3a4-1, promulgated under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Generally speaking, Rule 3a4-1 provides an exemption from the
	broker-dealer registration requirements of the Exchange Act for persons associated with an issuer that participate in the sale
	of the securities of such issuer.




	 




	Our
	officers and directors meet the conditions of the Rule 3a4-1 exemption, as: (1) they are not subject to any statutory disqualification,
	as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act; (2) they will not be compensated in connection with their participation
	in the direct public offering or resale offering by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or
	indirectly on transactions in our securities; and (3) they will not be associated persons of a broker or dealer at the time of
	their participation in the direct public offering and resale offering. Further, our officers and directors: (1) at the end of
	the offerings, will continue to primarily perform substantial duties for the Company or on its behalf otherwise than in connection
	with transactions in securities; (2) are not, nor have been within the preceding 12 months, a broker or dealer, and they are not,
	nor have they been within the preceding 12 months, an associated person of a broker or dealer; and (3) they have not participated
	in another offering of securities pursuant to the Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1 in the past 12 months and they have not and will not
	participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on the Exchange
	Act Rule 3a4-1(a)(4)(i) or (iii).




	 




	In
	order to comply with the applicable securities laws of certain states, the securities will be offered or sold in those states
	only if they have been registered or qualified for sale, an exemption from such registration is available, or if
	qualification requirement is available and with which the Company has complied. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing,
	the Company will be subject to applicable provisions, rules and regulations under the Exchange Act with regard to security transactions
	during the period of time when this Registration Statement is effective.




	 






	Offering
	Period and Expiration Date






	 




	This
	offering will start on the date of this Prospectus and continue for a period of up to 180 days, unless extended by our board
	of directors for an additional 90 days




	 






	Concurrent
	Offering






	 




	The
	Company will be offering shares of the Company’s Common Stock under the direct public offering at the same time that the
	Selling Shareholders will be offering shares of the Company’s Common Stock under the resale offering. The Selling Shareholders
	include our officers and directors who will be selling shares on their own behalf, individually. Pursuant to our informal Code
	of Ethics, our officers and directors have an ethical obligation to give their loyalty to the best interests of the Company. As
	such, our officers and directors will first offer shares of the Company’s Common Stock under the direct public offering
	on behalf of the Company and will offer their individual shares in the resale offering only if the direct public offering is fully
	subscribed.

	Procedures
	for Subscribing






	 




	If
	you decide to subscribe for any shares in this offering, you must:

	2.




	deliver a check, certified funds
	or cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds directly to the Company for acceptance or rejection.






	 




	The

	you are purchasing, and the price you are paying for your shares.




	 




	All
	checks for subscriptions must be made payable to

	Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc.







	 








	Acceptance
	of Subscriptions

	will be accepted or rejected within 48 hours after we receive them.




	 






	No Minimum
	Subscription








	 






	There
	is no minimum number of shares that must be sold under the offering. As such, there is no guarantee that the Company will raise
	any funds from the offering.






	 








	Penny Stock
	Regulation






	 




	Our
	Common Shares are not quoted on any stock exchange or quotation system. The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer
	practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than
	$5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that
	current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange system).




	 




	The
	penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver
	a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that:




	 





	contains a description of the nature and
	level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;




	contains a description of the broker’s
	or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation
	of such duties;




	contains a brief, clear, narrative description
	of a dealer market, including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread
	between the bid and ask price;




	contains a toll-free telephone number for
	inquiries on disciplinary actions;




	defines significant terms in the disclosure
	document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and,




	contains such other information and is
	in such form (including language, type, size, and format) as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.













	16










	 







	The
	broker-dealer also must provide the customer with the following, prior to proceeding with any transaction in a penny stock:




	 





	bid and offer quotations for the penny
	stock;




	details of the compensation of the broker-dealer
	and its salesperson in the transaction;




	the number of shares to which such bid
	and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock;
	and,




	monthly account statements showing the
	market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.







	In
	addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the
	broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
	the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement and a signed and dated copy of a written

	suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect
	of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules.
	Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities.






	 







	Registration
	Rights






	 




	We
	have not granted registration rights to any persons.





	 













	DILUTION






	 




	Net tangible book value
	per share represents the amount of the Company’s tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the 30,000,000 shares
	of Common Stock outstanding as of June 30, 2016 pursuant to the financials enclosed herein. Net tangible book value
	dilution per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of the Shares in this offering assuming
	the offering price of $0.50 per share of Common Stock and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of Common Stock immediately
	after completion of the offering.


	 


	After giving effect to
	the sale of the 20,000,000 shares offered by the Company hereunder, at an Offering Price of $.50 per share the pro forma net tangible
	book value of the Company at June 30, 2016, would have been $.19483 per share, representing an immediate increase
	in tangible book value of $.20345 per share to existing shareholders and an immediate dilution of $.30517 per share
	to purchasers of the Shares.


	 


	The following table
	illustrates the foregoing information with respect to new investors on a per share basis:

	Preferred

	Our
	Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001. The shares
	of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is authorized to provide for
	the issue of such series of shares of Preferred Stock.




	 






	Voting Rights






	 




	Except
	as otherwise required by law or as may be provided by the resolutions of the board of directors authorizing the
	issuance of Common Stock, all rights to vote and all voting power shall be vested in the holders of Common Stock.  Each share
	of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote.  




	 






	No Cumulative
	Voting






	 




	Except
	as may be provided by the resolutions of the board of directors authorizing the issuance of Common Stock, cumulative
	voting by any shareholder is expressly denied.




	 






	No Preemptive
	Rights

	have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock since inception and presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will
	be retained for development of our business and that no dividends on our Common Stock will be declared in the foreseeable future.
	Any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future
	earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and other pertinent facts. Therefore,
	there can be no assurance that any dividends on our Common Stock will be paid in the future.

	No Public
	Market for Common Stock






	 




	There
	is currently no public trading market for our Common Stock and no such market may ever develop. While we intend to seek and obtain
	quotation of our Common Stock for trading on the OTC Markets (“OTCQB”), there is no assurance that our
	application will be approved. An application for quotation on the OTCQB must be submitted by one or more market makers
	who: 1) are approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”); 2) who agree to sponsor the security;
	and 3) who demonstrate compliance with SEC Rule 15(c)2-11 before initiating a quote in a security on the OTCQB. In order
	for a security to be eligible for quotation by a market maker on the OTCQB, the security must be registered with the SEC
	and the company must be current in its required filings with the SEC. There are no listing requirements for the OTCQB and

	DESCRIPTION
	OF OUR BUSINESS








	 







	The Company Overview





	 





	The Company was incorporated
	in the State of Nevada on July 24 2015. We were incorporated and our business plan called for the Company to seek out and acquire
	various mining assets in the State of Nevada. Rancho Santa Fe Mining Inc. is a precious metals exploration and development company
	with the objective of becoming a gold producer. The Company is currently focused on the advancement of its two principal projects:
	the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims.


	 


	On October 28, 2015, the
	Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase”) with Humboldt Mining Company, Inc., a Nevada
	corporation (“HMCI”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the assets owned by HMCI,
	including, but not limited to: (i) all the real property, leasehold improvements, fixtures, furniture, machinery and equipment
	owned by the HMCI and relating to or used in HMCI’s operations; and, (ii) all inventory, including finished goods, raw materials
	and work in process as well as the right to receive inventory ordered by the HMCI for use in its operations; and, (iii) in addition
	to the foregoing, we acquired all the books and records of HMCI, as well as all intangible assets held, owned or controlled by
	HMCI (collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to hereinafter as the “Acquired Assets”). As per the Asset
	Purchase we acquired various liabilities of the HMCI, including: (i) the assumption of all liabilities arising out of any unfilled
	customer orders outstanding as of the date the Asset Purchase closed, the Company is entitled to any future payments relating
	to any payments made pursuant thereto; (ii) the assumption of obligations relating to a lawsuit and default judgment, including,
	but not limited to the obligation to pay attorneys’ fees of approximately $20,000.00, and, (iii)

	inherited HMCI’s reclamation liability, if any, as it is related to the property.

	There are no royalties due
	or owing on the purchased claims. The only amounts due are local property taxes, which are assessed annually.


	 


	In exchange for the Acquired
	Assets the Company issued to the HMCI shareholders Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand (13,500,000) shares of the Company’s
	$0.001 par value common stock, which represented fifty (50%) percent of the Company’s issued and outstanding
	shares at the time of issuance.

	The Company now owns land
	and the patented mining rights North of Elko, Nevada nearby the formation known as the Carlin Trend. The Company’s property
	includes two patented claims – the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims - comprising what is known as the Prunty Mine
	Area (Vanity Fair, Virginia,

	3871 Mining Survey Number

	). The 2 patented mining claims (Prunty Mine – Virginia and
	Vanity Fair Patents) total approximately 40 acres. The importance of these patented claims cannot be underestimated. We owned
	the Patented Mining Claims and the mineral rights associated with the Patents have no expiration date, subject to property
	taxes being paid on the property.


	 




	Operationally, the Company
	intends to outsource fully 100% of the exploration, site preparation and extraction operations to a third party who provides all
	manpower, equipment and operational expenses associated therewith. Insomuch as this work will be outsourced and the Company income
	will be

	based on profits from the sale of gold recovered by the contractors,

	the Company cannot
	speak to the outsourced expenditures related to exploration, site preparation and extraction.


	 


	As such, the proceeds
	will largely be utilized for payroll, outsourced consultants and asset maintenance and development. The Company plans to retain
	five full time staff and lease nominal executive office facilities in Nevada. All legal, accounting, shareholder
	relations and geology can be outsourced to consultants as needed. Business development is limited to developing
	and maintaining a website presence, and nominal travel and business entertainment expense. The primary additional operations entail
	asset development, which includes the maintenance of applicable permits and claim renewals, as well as the outsourced production
	of independent Reserve Reports annually

	 



	 


	The purpose of this exploration
	program is to identify a gold ore body. Geophysics (a magnetic survey and GIS compilation) was commissioned in the summer of 2011
	by Humboldt Mining Company. The geophysical survey was completed in the field by Christopher McGee and interpreted by James
	Wright of Wright Geophysics. The data returned identified 2 anomalies on the Prunty patented claims. These anomalies
	that are the target of the current exploration program.



	 



	The exploration (drilling)
	will begin as soon as is feasible. First, the drill hole locations
	must be identified. The anomalies have been identified by the geophysical survey completed in 2011.


	 


	On the blow up of the
	1:24,000 topo map, a 4WD drive road is marked coming up the back (north - west) side of the Prunty ridge from Union Gulch to the
	north. At present, there is no assurance that the USFS (United States Forest Service) would allow its use. If this road
	can be used for drill access, the drilling could begin as soon as the USFS approves its use. The target is on patented claims
	surrounded by Forest Service lands with a permitted access road up the front (south) side to the historic Prunty mine area, after
	fording the creek.



	 







	No drilling can begin until
	water drops in the creek (If 76 Creek is to be forded), which, at the earliest, would be late summer into the fall. 
	The creek needs to be forded and an access road to the proposed drill sites may need to be constructed on patented lands from the
	mine site. The corners of the patented claims would be marked by Carlin Trend Mining services. 


	 


	Initial drilling would
	be completed by a buggy or track mounted RC drill. A fence would be drilled across each of the anomalies (there are 2 total) with
	angle drill holes. At least one of the anomalies would be drilled as time permits. The depth of each drill hole would be no deeper
	than about 700 feet and the angle would be no shallower than -55.


	 


	At this point in time,
	we do not know how many holes would be needed, but based on the map, we expect about 8 to 12 drill holes in the
	1st phase if both anomalies are drilled. Following phases would likely be core drill holes and possibly deeper. If anything is
	found, the hole likely would need to be twinned by a core hole. Whether or not a 2nd phase can be completed before winter sets
	in, is weather dependent. The assay results need to be in hand and evaluated. ALS Chemex in Elko, Nevada would
	be used for assaying.


	 


	As discussed, an access
	road to the drill site would likely need to be constructed to the drill sites from the historic Prunty mine site. All of this
	would be on parented lands and of less than 5 acres’ total disturbance. The NDEP has told me that no specific permit
	is required for this level of disturbance. Filing a Small Miner's notice would be sufficient. A reclamation bond may need to be
	posted to NDEP and the USFS would need to be notified, however.


	 




	Initial funding will mark
	the beginning of the development of the initial drill site. Further exploration phases will be conducted as needed in the following
	year. This further exploration may include opening of the Prunty mine. This decision will be made upon successful completion of
	the initial phases.

	The best estimate is that
	a minimum of approximately USD 350,000 to a maximum of USD 900,000 would be needed to adequately fund the projects as envisioned.
	However, the following Drill Budget is a preliminary
	estimate of potential costs associate with the drilling program:

	There
	are no specific permit requirements if the disturbance is less than 5 acres and on private land. The United States Forest Service
	(USFS) needs to be informed and the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) Reclamation division has no requirements
	for such a level of disturbance. The NDEP would like a Small Miner's Permit filed so they know what is happening. The NDEP's Division
	of Reclamation may pay a visit to the site.


	On unpatented claims, the USFS needs a Plan of Operation (POO) filed and bonding
	posted for any level of disturbance. Even in designated road less areas, historic old roads can be used, especially with low impact
	vehicles. This is decided on a case-by-case basis, and only when a POO is filed. The USFS has a spreadsheet for determining the
	level of bonding required.

	Asset Analysis







	 







	Background






	 




	In
	1912, Dr. Pinkard Prunty purchased 1,200 acres of Nevada wilderness from the then future President of the United States, Herbert
	Hoover. Gold was discovered on the land soon after. Dr. Prunty immediately employed day workers with pick axes to begin extraction,
	and over the next decades purchased an additional 120,000 acres with his gold revenues. After his death, the property passed to
	his children, who continued to successfully mine gold on the property with pick-axes. In 1979, family member Charles Leavitt reviewed
	the mine’s books and uncovered the fact that revenues had been mishandled. This lead to a dispute and the family
	closing of the mine in 1980.




	 




	In
	1997, David Leavitt, inherited the land and the associated patented mining claims on the property. Leavitt was the Chairman
	of Humboldt Mining Company, Inc.




	 





	 




	 




	Management
	believes there is persuasive evidence the geological structure of the area is potentially on a major mineralized zone, perhaps
	part of the Carlin Trend.




	 




	Based
	on management’s experience and all available documentation, we believe we have a “Carlin-type deposit”.
	This type of deposit possess what geologists call “disseminated gold.” It generally takes a microscope
	to see the gold in such deposits. In such deposits, the grade may be low but they make up for low-grade in high-volume. To
	extract gold from such low-grade deposits, miners crush tons of rock, which is piled into heaps and irrigated with cyanide,
	an industrial-scale mining technique that was actually pioneered at the Carlin Trend. As the gold price shot up at the end of
	the 1970s, mining companies rushed to look for similar deposits around the world - just as the Prunty family’s lands were
	closed in a family dispute.




	 





	The claims are located
	on private land in Elko County in Sections 13, 14, 23, and 24, Township 44 North, Range 57 East, Mount Diablo Baseline and
	Meridian, approximately 63 miles north of the town of Elko. The site can be accessed by traveling east on Interstate-80 to
	exit 333, turning north and then immediately taking the frontage road east. After approximately 1.25 miles, turn north on Charleston-Deeth
	Road. After approximately 41 miles, turn right onto county road NF-062 (Jarbidge-Charleston County Road - County Road 748), continuing
	for approximately 9 miles. Turn left onto the unnamed dirt road, ford 76 Creek and continue approximately 0.5 mile to the mine
	site.

	The sedimentary units
	seen in the mine area are referred to as shales and limestones instead of their actual metamorphic counterparts. Limestones are
	Devonian. Pilot shale and Joana limestone are Pennsylvanian in age. Near the margins of the intrusive, the sediments have
	all been metamorphosed. The granodiorite plug is the oldest igneous unit on the property and is probably Jurassic in age. The
	intrusive is elongate to the northwest, parallel to the trace of the range-front fault. Along the southern edge of the intrusive
	in the Prunty mining area is a series of diabase dikes. It appears the Prunty mine was actually developed on this dike. The dike
	is composed mainly of plagioclase, chloritized hornblend and biotite. Volcanic rocks on the property area are all of the Jarbidge
	rhyolite formation. Mineralization is hosted in relatively narrow (four [4] to six [6] feet wide) quartz veins that dip at approximately
	45 degrees.


	 


	The only work completed
	to date is the drilling described in the report "The Humboldt Mines Project, Elko County, Nevada" dated March 2, 2012,
	and there are, at present, no improvements or equipment on site.


	There is no equipment, infrastructure or other facilities
	on site. The nearest places to stay are Wild Horse Reservoir, Elko County Nevada, Owyhee, Idaho or Elko, Nevada. For the
	geophysical survey, the field operations were based out of Owyhee, Idaho. Once necessary, power will be sourced from diesel power
	and diesel powered generators if needed. The water will be obtained from the Black Warrior mine if accessible. If a USFS Permit
	is obtained, water can be obtained from 76 Creek. If this cannot be obtained, there are private wells in the town of Charleston,
	which is less than 5 miles from the project.


	 


	The property has no known
	reserves and the proposed program is exploratory in nature.

	Pelke Technical
	Evaluation Report







	 





	In
	addition to his September 2015 opinion letter, in August, 2011, Paul Pelke was retained as a consulting geologist to prepare a
	technical evaluation report (

	hereinafter referred to as the “

	Pelke Report

	”

	) on the Humboldt Mines Project
	in northern Elko County, Nevada. The Pelke Report was completed February 24, 2012 and details the assets, locations, geology,
	production and exploration history of the Company’s patented lands. The key findings of the Pelke Report are summarized
	below.




	 



	The property has been
	drilled three times; in 1984, 1986 and 2010. Mr. Pelke collected 2 samples from various locations on the property and subsequently
	for analysis by the ALS Chemex analytical laboratory in Reno, Nevada. These returned gold traces between 0.028 ppm (

	parts-per-million

	)
	and 32.4ppm. A concentration of 34.2857 ppm is 1.0 OPT. All samples have been taken in a 7" x 12.5" poly-propylene sample
	bag. It is well known that a full sample bag of that size weighs between 7 and 8 pounds and that is the weight of each grab sample
	taken.



	  




	During
	the early summer of 2011, Humboldt Mining commissioned a ground magnetic survey of the Claim Group. Magee Geophysical Services
	of Reno, Nevada, carried out the survey and Wright Geophysics of Spring Creek, Nevada, completed the interpretation. Based on
	this data, Wright Geophysics produced two maps showing Areas of Interest (AOI). The ground magnetic survey delineates what is
	interpreted as a heavily intruded sedimentary terrain dominated by two primary structural orientations. Most prominent among the
	structures is a Northwest Corridor traversing the entire project area for 2 kilometers. This zone should be considered to be a
	principal target area. Wright interprets the corridor to be composed of one large continuous structure as well as several smaller
	parallel structures to the northeast.




	 




	At
	this time, the Company has performed no verification work of its own. The drilling and geophysics discussed above was
	completed in 2012. Both the drilling and the Ground Magnetic Survey and GIS Compilation were completed to industry standards.




	 




	The
	Pelke Report recommends initial work should be done in the Prunty Mine area. The quartz with sulfides recovered returned values
	of 32.4 ppm (

	about 1.0 OPT

	). Consequently, it may be possible to develop underground vein deposit. In addition,
	the Prunty Patented Claims cover the most important parts of the Northwest Corridor based on Areas of Interest (AOI) identified
	by Wright Geophysics.




	 









	Exploration Work: Prunty Claims Virginia
	and Vanity Fair Patents




	 


	When Pelke arrived
	on the claim group, the initial work that was showed consisted of three areas: the Prunty Mine itself and the Cleveland and Manhattan
	Patents area.


	 


	Samples 199056 and
	199057 were grab samples taken from the Prunty Dump. The mine itself was not accessible because the portal was caved. 199056 was
	a grab sample of a quartz fraction which contained visible sulfides. The sulfides included pyrite, chalcopyrite and possible arsenopyrite.
	199057 was a grab sample of the dark fraction which appeared to be a fine grained mafic intrusive with possible disseminated sulfides.
	199056 (Quartz fraction) returned 32.4 ppm Au (which is equivalent to just over 1 ounce of Au per metric ton), while 199057 (mafic
	intrusive) returned 0.028 ppm Au. The sample locations can be found on Figure 5 at the point labeled “PRUNTY”. (Figure
	5 attached).


	 


	Sample results are
	given in “Table of Detailed Sample Results” which was prepared by ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada. The weights are given
	along with the results.


	 


	Later, after the area
	was run for ground magnetics by Magee Geophysics of Reno, Nevada, and interpreted by Wright Geophysics of Elko, Nevada.


	 


	The patented Prunty
	Claims present a very interesting target area (Figures 5, 6, 8 and 9). Not only does the high grade Prunty Mine lie on this patented
	ground but also the intrusive interpreted to be present by Wright as well as the portion of the Northwest Corridor that has several
	of the largest and most important AOI's as defined by Wright 2011.

	The yellow box outlines
	the Virginia and Vanity Fair Patented Claims. The red hachured areas represent Areas of Interest (AOI) as defined by Wright Geophysics
	(2011). The mapped road shows access to the Prunty Patents, which is already permitted by the USFS.


	 


	The ground magnetic
	survey delineates what is interpreted as a heavily intruded sedimentary terrain dominated by two primary structural orientations.
	Most prominent among the structures is a Northwest Corridor traversing the entire project area for 2 kilometers. Diabase dikes,
	which have been noted to be associated with mineralization at the Prunty Mine, are interpreted along the entire length of the
	Northwest Corridor (Wright, 2011). Consequently, this zone which was defined by Wright Geophysics, should be considered to be
	the principal target area. Wright interprets the corridor to be composed of one large continuous structure as well as several
	smaller parallel structures to the northeast. The Prunty is located within this corridor, and have the best geophysical anomalies
	in the entire area.

	RECOMMENDATIONS




	 


	It is recommended that
	the initial work be done in the Prunty Mine area. The quartz with sulfides recovered from the dump returned Au values of 32.4
	ppm Au. This amounts to approximately 1 ounce per metric ton (tonne). Consequently it may be possible to develop a high grade
	underground vein deposit. In addition the Prunty Patented Claims also cover one of the most important parts of the Northwest Corridor
	(Figure 9), based on the size of the AOI's identified by Wright Geophysics(2011).


	 


	Since this is Patented
	land (Private) no direct US Forest Service approval is needed to begin work. The USFS is interested in work completed on Patented
	Lands in so far as it impacts adjoining USFS Lands. Apparently, Humboldt Mining Company already has approval from the Forest Service
	to rehabilitate the access road located on the unpatented surrounding ground up the hill to the Prunty Mine portal area.


	 


	The Humboldt Mining
	Company (and its successor Rancho Santa Fe Mining Inc.) has been in contact with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection
	(NDEP). Rock and water samples have been submitted to an approved environmental laboratory for analysis. The sample results raised
	no obvious red flags and a waste water discharge permit should be approved within the standard time frame, i.e., about 5 to 6
	months.


	 









	27










	 






	Since the Virginia
	and Vanity Fair is private land, roads can then be constructed to access drill sites on the principal Northwest Corridor structure.
	There generally is no close monitoring by the NDEP (Nevada Department of Environmental Protection) but a plan does need to be
	filed.

	If the Prunty Mine
	were reopened and rehabilitated, underground drilling can be considered for use in trying to define other high grade veins. Underground
	drilling may prove to be less expensive and more efficient in locating extensions of and/or parallel structures to the Prunty
	than by drilling from the surface.

	Mining Technique:
	Cyanide Heap Leaching







	 





	The
	geology of the Company’s assets dictates the Company use of Cyanide Heap Leaching similar to the mining techniques
	pioneered and used at the nearby Carlin Trend. More than 90% of all gold extracted worldwide relies upon the use of cyanide. Of
	the 1.1 million tons of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) produced annually, only 6% is for use in the mining industry. The remaining 94%
	is used to produce a wide variety of products such as adhesives, computer electronics, fire retardants and nylon.




	 






	In
	heap leaching, a cyanide solution is dripped or sprayed onto heaps of crushed ore that is placed over impervious liners. The cyanide
	solution dissolves minute particles of gold and silver in the ore to form a water-soluble compound. The resulting solution
	containing the metals in this form is collected and processed to extract the gold and silver for further refining. The remaining
	cyanide solution is then recycled and reused for extraction.










	28










	 







	Mine
	operators have stringent safety practices to minimize risks to workers, the environment, and communities. These include strict
	workplace safety measures, employee training programs and emergency response plans to prepare workers to respond quickly to exposure
	to cyanide or spillage. To prevent any release to the environment, mines integrate protective measures such as constructing liquid
	containment areas around tanks, utilizing impervious liners beneath leach pads and ponds, and installing leak detection and collection
	systems. 




	Nevada
	has over 100 active cyanide leach operations. Nevada's Water Pollution Control Law has cyanide performance standards for groundwater.
	Guidelines specific to cyanide operations for closure and reclamation are outlined in the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection's
	(DEP) "Evaluations for Closure". All mining permits require stabilization of tailings and spent ore during closure.
	Closure is considered complete when the facility and mined areas have been stabilized and no longer have the potential to degrade
	waters of the state. Reclamation standards are site-specific. No design standards are prescribed in the Nevada law. The
	Nevada Department of Wildlife has a permit program for industrial ponds, including tailings impoundments and all cyanide process
	ponds.




	In
	order to get a viable feasibility study, the Company needs to have a metallurgical test run on the potential ores from the property.
	This is a must in order to define an economic reserve and will determine whether or not the potential ore in question is amenable
	or not to heap leaching or milling. The testing will be done by a reputable and certified laboratory, such as McClelland Labs
	in Reno, Nevada. The amount of material will be determined by the laboratory (usually tons).




	The
	Company intends to maintain quality assurance/quality control protocols, including when preparing samples, ensuring proper custody,
	assay precision and accuracy as we implement our exploration plans. There are three aspects to a proper QA/QC program:
	Blanks, Duplicates and CRM or Certified Reference Material.




	BLANKS:
	Blank material can be purchased from a local supplier, which consist of crushed concrete blocks. These have been assayed
	and have statistics on the results. Alternatively, one can purchase decorative cobbles (usually marble) from a local hardware
	store. The idea is to put the reference blanks through the process of crushing and pulverization in the same manner as the gold
	bearing material. Proper cleaning of the crusher-pulverizer between gold bearing samples is essential due to the possibility of
	gold smearing inside this equipment, especially from higher-grade samples.




	DUPLICATES

	.

	It is easy and straightforward to produce duplicate samples in a Reverse Circulation drill program as the company proposes.
	In a core program, field sample duplicates necessitate using 1/4 of the core as a duplicate. Laboratory samples need to be arraigned
	before hand with the assay laboratory. This duplicate will be taken after crushing and before pulverization, and will require
	submitting an empty sample bag with a sequential tag to the lab. This will test a laboratory's sample preparation procedure. Laboratories
	routinely insert blanks into each batch.




	CRM
	or CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL

	.

	In this case, the matrix of the CRM should be similar to the sample. Since the samples
	consist of shales, limestones and cherts, finding a suitable CRM is not easy. In Reno, the CRM's available
	come from local mines and western volcanic rocks, the matrix of which is not compatible with the rock types expected.














	Regulatory:






	 




	On
	the patented (

	private

	) lands, no direct US Forest Service (

	USFS

	) approval is needed to begin work. The USFS is primarily
	interested in work completed on Patented Lands only to the extent such work impacts adjoining USFS Lands. To get approval to drill
	in 2010, the USFS had to conduct archeological, biological, botanical and water quality evaluations of the project site and received
	approval at that time. The Company already has approval from the USFS to rehabilitate the access road located on the unpatented
	surrounding ground up the hill to the Prunty Mine portal area.




	 




	The
	USFS is reluctant to allow building of new roads. Consequently, drill pads need to be located along or next to existing
	roads. There are many old drill roads in the area, some dating from the 1984 and 1986 drilling. On private land, roads can be
	constructed to access drill sites on the principal Northwest Corridor structure. From the standpoint of working on the lands,
	topography is gentle to moderate and vegetation is mostly sagebrush. The average annual precipitation over the area varies from
	8 to 15 inches, a major portion of which occurs as snow during the winter months. There is no electrical power line to the property.
	Elko is the most prominent population center in the area and provides a broad range of services and supplies to the mining industry.




	 












	29










	 






	The
	agency responsible for patented claims is the Nevada Division of Environmental Quality (NDEQ) in Carson City, Nevada. There are
	no known environmental liabilities within the claim group. Humboldt was also in contact with the Nevada Department of Environmental
	Protection (NDEP). Rock and water samples were submitted and there were no red flags. There generally is no stringent monitoring
	by the NDEP (

	Nevada Department of Environmental Protection

	), but a plan must be filed.




	 












	Employees






	 





	We
	currently employ 4 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. Our employees perform overlapping roles and have
	responsibilities for different segments of our business.






	 









	LEGAL
	PROCEEDINGS







	 






	Robison v. Humboldt Mining Company, Inc.





	 




	On
	March 25, 2015, Robert Robison filed suit against Humboldt Mining Company, Inc. (“Humboldt”) seeking declaratory judgment
	with respect to Robison’s (i) alleged ownership of certain unpatented mining claims in Elko, Nevada, for which he is seeking
	a declaratory judgment; and (ii) alleged 10% ownership in Humboldt. In addition, Robison claims that he is owed $24,200 under
	a prior consulting agreement with Humboldt. (Robison v. Humboldt Mining Company, Inc., CV-BU15-169, Department 1, Fourth Judicial
	District of the State of Nevada, County of Elko).




	 




	The
	Company, in its Asset Purchase Agreement with Humboldt, agreed to pay for any future payments owed on this lawsuit in addition
	to up to $20,000 in legal fees. A default judgment was entered into against Humboldt. On July 7, 2016, Humboldt filed a motion
	to set aside the default judgment which was granted by Order of the Court on July 26, 2016.

	There have been no material
	developments in this litigation since the Order by the Court to set aside the default judgment was granted.








	 









	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS






	 





	This
	Registration Statement contains forward looking statements relating to our Company's future economic performance, plans and objectives
	of management for future operations, projections of revenue mix and other financial items that are based on the beliefs of, as
	well as assumptions made by and information currently known to, our management. The words "expects”, “intends”,
	“believes”, “anticipates”, “may”, “could”, “should" and similar expressions
	and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this section
	are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement.





	 




	The following discussion
	and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the three months and nine months ended June 30,
	2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from July 24, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2015
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	 







	Overview








	 






	The
	Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 24, 2015. We were incorporated and our business plan called for the Company
	to seek out and acquire various mining assets in the State of Nevada. Rancho Santa Fe Mining Inc. is precious metals exploration
	and development company with the objective of becoming a gold producer. The Company is currently focused on the advancement of
	its two principal projects: the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims.




	 




	On
	October 28, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase”) with Humboldt Mining
	Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“HMCI”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100%
	of certain assets owned by HMCI, including, but not limited to: (i) all the real property, leasehold improvements, fixtures, furniture,
	machinery and equipment owned by the HMCI and relating to or used in HMCI’s operations; and, (ii) all inventory, including
	finished goods, raw materials and work in process as well as the right to receive inventory ordered by the HMCI for use in its
	operations; and, (iii) in addition to the foregoing, we acquired all the books and records of HMCI, as well as all intangible
	assets held, owned or controlled by HMCI (collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to hereinafter as the “Acquired
	Assets”).




	 




	In
	exchange for the Acquired Assets the Company issued to the HMCI shareholders Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand shares of
	the Company’s $0.001 par value common stock, which represented fifty (50%) percent of the Company’s issued
	and outstanding shares at the time of issuance.




	 












	30










	 






	The Company now owns land
	and the patented mining rights North of Elko, Nevada nearby the formation known as the Carlin Trend. The Company’s property
	includes two patented claims – the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims - comprising what is known as the Prunty Mine
	Area (Vanity Fair, Virginia,

	3871 Mining Survey Number

	). The 2 patented mining claims (Prunty Mine – Virginia and
	Vanity Fair Patents) total approximately 40 acres. The importance of these patented claims cannot be underestimated. We own
	the Patented Mining Claims and the mineral rights associated with the Patents have no expiration date, subject to property
	taxes being paid on the property.



	 








	Operationally,
	the Company intends to outsource fully 100% of the exploration, site preparation and extraction operations to a third party who
	provides all manpower, equipment and operational expenses associated therewith. Insomuch as this work will be outsourced and the
	Company income will be based on based on profits from the sale of gold recovered by the contractors, the Company cannot speak
	to the outsourced expenditures related to exploration, site preparation and extraction.




	 




	As
	such, the proceeds will largely be utilized for payroll, outsourced consultants and asset maintenance and development. The Company
	plans to retain five full time staff and lease nominal executive office facilities in Nevada. All legal, accounting,
	shareholder relations and geology can be outsourced to consultants as needed. Business development is limited
	to developing and maintaining a website presence, and nominal travel and business entertainment expense. The primary additional
	operations entail asset development, which includes the maintenance of applicable permits and claim renewals, as well as
	the outsourced production of independent Reserve Reports annually

	.

	Operating Expenses



	               


	We incurred total operating
	expenses of $143,434 from July 25, 2015 (inception) to year ended September 30, 2015. All of these expenses related to general
	and administrative expenses, which included professional fees of $92,559 relating to legal and accounting costs incurred as part
	of the incorporation process of the Company. There is no historical financial data for the Company.


	.



	Net Loss



	 


	We incurred a net loss
	of 143,434 from July 25, 2015 (inception) to year ended September 30, 2015. As we did not generate any revenues during the year
	ended September 30, 2015, our net loss equaled our operating expenses.



	  



	 




	For the Three Month Period Ended June
	30, 2016





	 




	Revenues



	 


	We are still in our development
	stage and did not generate any revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2016.

	Operating Expenses



	               


	We incurred total operating
	expenses of $61,341 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. All of these expenses related to general and administrative
	expenses, and interest expense.


	 



	Net Loss



	 


	We incurred a net loss
	of $65,448 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. As we did not generate any revenues during the three months
	ended June 30, 2016, our net loss equaled our operating expenses in addition to $4,107 in interest expense.




	 






	 






	For the Nine Month Period ended
	June 30, 2016





	 




	Revenues



	 


	We are still in our development
	stage and did not generate any revenues during the nine months ended June 30, 2016.


	 







	Operating Expenses



	 


	We incurred total operating
	expenses of $141,071 for the nine months ended June 30, 2016. All of these expenses related to general and
	administrative expenses, and interest expense.


	 



	Net Loss



	 


	During the nine
	months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $145,187. As we did not generate any revenues during the nine
	months ended June 30, 2016, our net loss equaled our operating expenses in addition to $4,107 in interest expense.







	 



	 






	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As at June 30,
	2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $316,312, a net loss of $228,612 and has not earned any revenues
	to cover its operating costs. We have $1,303 cash on hand and our burn rate is approximately $21,000. Presently, our operations
	are being funded by cash advances from our executives. The Company intends to fund future operations through equity financing
	arrangements. The ability of the Company to realize its business plan is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional
	financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise
	additional funds through public or private placement offerings.


	 


	These factors, among
	others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements
	do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




	 




	Off-Balance Sheet
	Arrangements




	 


	As of June 30,
	2016, we had no off balance sheet transactions that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on
	our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
	or capital resources.









	 






	Critical
	Accounting Policies







	 





	Our
	financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
	principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
	principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
	disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
	expenses during the reporting periods.




	 












	32










	 







	We
	regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare for financial statements. A complete summary of
	these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical
	experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
	under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.

	Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact
	on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
	pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.




	 






	Cash Requirements







	 





	We
	anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the sale of
	the maximum amount of shares being offered hereunder will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 48 months.
	If we are able to sell only 75%, 50% or 25% of our offered shares, we anticipate that we will only be able to meet our anticipated
	cash needs for the next 36 months, 24 months or 12 months, respectively. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold
	and there is no guarantee that the Company will raise any funds from the offering.




	 








	We
	estimate that our maximum and minimum amount of expenses over the next 12 months will be approximately $2,500,000 and
	$1,500,000 respectively as described in the table below. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature
	of our future business activities and our ability to raise additional capital from shareholders or other sources. Some of these
	estimates will be paid for out of the proceeds of this offering, assuming we are successful in raising any such proceeds.

	The
	foregoing chart sets forth estimates of the Company’s total maximum and minimum operational expenses for the initial
	12-month period following effectiveness of this offering. The minimum expenses represent basic G&A expenses associated
	with minimal rents and office expenses, working capital for professional fees such as geologists and legal expenses directly associated
	with mining operations and the leases and project development expenses such as maintaining the permits, claim renewals, and preparation
	of reserve reports, and general legal, accounting and consultant expenses. The amounts are not limited to proceeds received
	under this offering, if any, and therefore in order to reach our targets, we will need additional funds in the form of financing
	or revenues.

	Our
	audit committee shall be primarily responsible for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors, evaluating our
	accounting policies and our system of internal controls. Our compensation committee shall assist the Board in reviewing and approving
	the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers and periodically
	reviewing and approving any long-term incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements. Our nominating
	committee shall assist the Board in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition
	of the Board and its committees.




	 






	Compliance
	with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act






	 




	Section
	16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more
	than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports
	of change in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders
	are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Since inception, we have not
	had a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Hence, compliance with
	Section 16(a) thereof by our officers and directors was not required.

	about us at the same time. Mr. Robb collects and evaluates all shareholder communications. All communications addressed to our
	directors and executive officers will be reviewed by those parties unless the communication is clearly frivolous.

	Related Party
	Transactions






	 




	For
	the period from July 24, 2015 (date of inception) to June 30, 2016, two of the Company’s executive
	officers/shareholders had advanced $228,743 for expenses relating to the Company and its operations. These advances have been
	reflected in the accompanying balance sheet under the caption “accounts payable – related parties.”

	An
	amount of $173,029 was advanced through personal credit card charges of executive officers/shareholders of the Company with
	interest rates varied from 9.49% to 16.24%. The remaining $55,714 were from cash advances. Our executive
	officers/shareholders are not seeking the return of any interest on the cash advances. There are no written agreements
	between the executive officers/shareholders and the Company with respect to any of the above advances.







	 




	On
	October 28, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase”) with Humboldt Mining
	Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“HMCI”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100%
	of certain assets owned by HMCI, including, but not limited to: (i) all the real property, leasehold improvements, fixtures, furniture,
	machinery and equipment owned by the HMCI and relating to or used in HMCI’s operations; and, (ii) all inventory, including
	finished goods, raw materials and work in process as well as the right to receive inventory ordered by the HMCI for use in its
	operations; and, (iii) in addition to the foregoing, we acquired all the books and records of HMCI, as well as all intangible
	assets held, owned or controlled by HMCI (collectively, (i), (ii) and (iii) are referred to hereinafter as the “Acquired
	Assets”.




	 




	In
	exchange for the Acquired Assets the Company issued to the HMCI shareholders Thirteen Million Five Hundred Thousand shares of
	the Company’s $0.001 par value common stock, which represented fifty (50%) percent of the Company’s issued
	and outstanding shares at the time of issuance. A copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement may be found as an Exhibit attached
	to this Registration Statement.




	 




	At
	the time of this transaction, our current Chairman of the Board Directors, Mr. Baron W. David Leavitt was a shareholder in Humboldt
	Mining Company and its Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Mr. Leavitt was issued shares of
	the Company and was appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors as Chairman.




	 




	Other
	than the foregoing, none of the directors or executive officers of the Company, nor any person who owned of record or was known
	to own beneficially more than 5% of the Company’s outstanding shares of its Common Stock, nor any associate or affiliate
	of such persons or companies, has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction that has occurred during the past
	fiscal year, or in any proposed transaction, which has materially affected or will affect the Company.




	 




	With
	regard to any future related party transaction, we plan to fully disclose any and all related party transactions in the following

	COMMISSION
	POSITION ON








	INDEMNIFICATION
	FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES






	 




	Our
	Articles of Incorporation and Nevada law provide that none of our officers or directors will be personally liable to the Company
	or its stockholders for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as an officer or director
	unless it is proven that:




	 








	·




	The
	officer’s or director’s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his
	or her fiduciary duties as an officer or director; and,










	·




	The
	breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation
	of law.






	 




	These
	provisions eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders to recover damages from an officer or director for his or her breach
	of a fiduciary duty unless such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. The limitations summarized
	above, however, do not affect our ability or that of our stockholders to seek non-monetary remedies, such as an injunction or
	rescission, against an officer or director for his or her acts or failure to act.




	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and other persons
	pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such
	indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
	FIRM



	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders


	Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc.


	San Diego, California 92123


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet
	of Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. as of September 30, 2015, and the related statement of operations, stockholders’ deficit
	and cash flows for the period from July 24, 2015 (inception) to September 30, 2015.  These financial statements are the
	responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our
	audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
	for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
	effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly we express no such opinion.  An
	audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
	the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. as of September 30, 2015,
	and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from July 24, 2015 (inception) to September 30, 2015 in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements,
	the Company’s limited capital resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Management’s
	plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
	might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Rancho Santa
	Fe Mining, Inc.









	Notes to Financial
	Statements






	September 30,
	2015





	 






	Note 1 –
	Organization and Business Activity






	 



	Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. (“RSFM”
	or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 24, 2015. The Company’s business plan details
	a strategy to seek out and acquire various precious metal mining assets in the State of Nevada. RSFM is a developmental company
	engaged in precious metals exploration with the objective of becoming a substantial gold producer. The Company is currently focused
	on the advancement of its two principal projects:  the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims, both of which are located
	in northern Nevada, which were acquired in October 2015.


	 


	Operationally, the Company intends to outsource
	all of the exploration, site preparation and extraction to a third-party who provides all the manpower, equipment and operational
	expenses associated therewith. The third-party operator will compensate the Company through a royalty equal to 20% to 30% of profits
	derived from sale the gold reserves recovered and sold by this party from the acquired mining claims noted above. The Company
	plans to retain four full time staff members in various capacities and lease office facilities in California. Legal, accounting,
	shareholder relations and geology will be outsourced to consultants as needed. Business development for the Company will be limited
	to developing and maintaining a website presence, nominal travel and business expense.



	 






	Note
	2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  






	 





	Basis
	of Presentation

	—The accompanying financial statements are pr


	epared in accordance with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The Company has selected September 30th as
	their fiscal year end.




	 





	Going Concern

	—As
	shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has limited cash and no revenues and has accumulated a deficit of
	$143,434 as of September 30, 2015.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
	as a going concern.  Management intends to seek additional capital from new equity securities offerings and short-term
	borrowings if necessary that will provide funds needed to increase liquidity and fully implement its business plan.  The
	financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the
	amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.




	 





	Use of Estimates

	—Preparing
	the Company’s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities
	and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
	and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Cash and cash
	equivalents

	—Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and liquid investments with an original maturity
	of three months or less. Because of the short maturity of these   investments, the carrying amounts approximate
	their fair value.




	 





	Fair Value Measures


	-

	ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
	requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  ASC
	820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure
	fair value.  A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest
	level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels
	that may be used to measure fair value:




	 




	Level
	1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.




	 




	Level
	2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
	such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
	markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model derived valuations in which significant
	inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.




	 




	Level
	3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
	the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.




	 









	F-

	7










	 







	This hierarchy
	requires the Company to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when estimating
	fair value.  




	 









	Financial Instruments

	—The
	Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable.  Pursuant
	to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assts.  The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair
	values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or duration.




	 





	Mineral Properties

	—Mineral
	property acquisition costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined. When proven
	and probable reserves are determined for a property, subsequent development costs on the property would be capitalized. If a project
	were to be put into production, capitalized development costs would be depleted on the units of production basis determined by
	the proven and probable reserves for that project.




	 





	Asset Retirement
	Obligation –

	Future obligations to retire an asset, including site closure, are recorded as a liability at the fair
	value incurred. The fair value determination is based on estimated future cash flows, the current credit-adjusted risk-free interest
	rate and an estimated inflation factor. The value of the liability is evaluated at least annually or as new information becomes
	available. As reclamation work is performed or liabilities are otherwise settled, the recorded liability amount will be reduced.




	 




	Future reclamation
	expenditures are difficult to estimate in many circumstances due to the early stage nature of the exploration project, the uncertainties
	associated with defining the nature and extent of environmental disturbance, the application of laws and regulations by regulatory
	authorities and changes in reclamation technology. Changes in estimates are reflected in the statement of operations in the period
	an estimate is revised.




	 





	Loss Per Common
	Share

	—Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
	during the period, and does not include the impact of any potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.  Potential
	common shares are not included in the computation of loss per share, as their effect is antidilutive.




	 





	Impairment of
	Long-Lived Assets

	—The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment annually and at interim periods
	if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined
	to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets. An
	impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based
	on quantities of recoverable minerals, expected gold and other commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price
	trends and related factors), production levels and operating costs of production and capital, all based on life-of-mine plans.
	The term “recoverable minerals” refers to the estimated amount of gold or other commodities that will be obtained
	after taking into account losses during processing and treatment. Estimates of recoverable minerals from such mineral interests
	are risk adjusted based on management’s relative confidence in such materials.




	 




	In estimating future
	cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of
	future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions
	and it is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities
	of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels and operating costs of production and capital are
	each subject to significant risks and uncertainties.




	 





	Mining Development
	Costs

	—Mine development costs are amortized using the units of production method based upon projected recoverable ounces
	in proven and probable reserves. Projected recoverable ounces are determined by the Company based upon its proven and probable
	reserves and estimated metal recovery associated with those reserves.  As of September 30, 2015, no mines are in production
	therefore none are being amortized.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition

	—The Company has not yet achieved any revenues.  Revenue will be recognized on profits from
	the sale of gold recovered by contractors, royalties from the sale of gold, silver, and other metal sales when persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the metal is delivered, the title has been transferred
	to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured.




	 





	Advertising
	Costs

	—The Company expense advertising costs as they are incurred and had no advertising costs as of September 30, 2015.




	 











	F-

	8










	 








	Income Taxes

	—The
	Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, which recognizes certain temporary differences between the financial
	reporting basis of the Company’s liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets.
	This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the Company, as measured by the statutory tax rates
	in effect. The Company derives its deferred income tax charge or benefit, if any, by recording the change in either the net deferred
	income tax liability or asset balance for the year.




	 




	At September 30,
	2015, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of its deferred income tax assets, which it believes, based on the
	weight of available evidence; it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be
	realized.




	 











	Stock-based
	Compensation

	—The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock
	Based Compensation” and ASC 505 “Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees”, which requires the measurement and
	recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based awards made to employees and directors,
	including stock options.




	 




	ASC 718 requires
	companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.  The
	Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as its method of determining fair value.  This model is affected
	by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables.  These subjective
	variables include, but are not limited to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and
	actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.  The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately
	expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.




	 




	All transactions
	in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the
	fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.





	 






	Recent Accounting
	Pronouncements

	—The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact
	its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that
	might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.




	 






	Note 3 –
	Related Party Transactions






	 




	For the period
	from July 24, 2015 (date of inception) to September 30, 2015, two of the Company’s executive officers/shareholders had advanced
	$147,047 for expenses relating to the Company and its operations. These advances have been reflected in the accompanying balance
	sheet under the caption “accounts payable – related parties.” The stock subscriptions receivables due from the
	stockholders were collected on November 5, 2015.




	 






	Note 4 –
	Federal Income Taxes






	 




	Total income tax
	benefit is less than the amount computed by multiplying the loss before income taxes by the statutory federal income tax rate.  The
	reasons for the difference and the related tax effects for the period ended September 30, 2015:

	The Company has
	no deferred tax liabilities.




	 






	 




	As of September
	30, 2015, the Company had a federal income tax net operating loss carry forward of approximately $143,434 to offset future taxable
	income, which begins to expire in 2025. The Company has never had an Internal Revenue Service audit.




	 






	Note 5 –
	Commitments and Contingencies






	 




	Certain conditions
	may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be
	resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.  The Company’s management and legal counsel assess
	such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.  In assessing loss contingencies
	related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the
	Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived
	merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.




	 




	If the assessment
	of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated,
	the estimated liability is accrued in the Company’s financial statements.  If the assessment indicates that a
	potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then
	the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material,
	will be disclosed.


	Loss contingencies considered remote are generally
	not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees are disclosed.




	 






	Note 6 –
	Subsequent Events






	 




	The Company’s
	management have evaluated subsequent events through December 11, 2015, the date the financial statements were issued. In the opinion
	of the Company’s management, there have been no significant events since September 30, 2015, other than the acquisition
	of certain mining claims in exchange for 13,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock on October 28, 2015.




	 




	On October 28,
	2015, the Company entered into an “Asset Purchase Agreement by and between Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. and Humboldt Mining
	Company, Inc.” This agreement required the Company to issue 13,500,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for certain
	land and mining claims.








	 




	On September 30,
	2015, the Company entered into an “Equity Purchase Agreement” with Kodiak Capital Group, LLC (“Kodiak”)
	whereby Kodiak can purchase up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock. The stock would be sold for a price equal to
	the closing bid price for the Company’s common stock on the principal market on a trading day as reported by Bloomberg Finance
	L.P. The Company committed to issue Kodiak Capital 3,000,000 shares of its common stock as a commitment shares.

	Notes to Financial Statements




	June 30, 2016




	(Unaudited)



	 



	Note 1 – Organization and
	Business Activity



	 


	Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. (“RSFM”
	or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 24, 2015. The Company’s business plan details
	a strategy to seek out and acquire various precious metal mining assets in the State of Nevada. RSFM is a developmental company
	engaged in precious metals exploration with the objective of becoming a substantial gold producer. The Company is currently focused
	on the advancement of its two principal projects:  the Virginia and Vanity Fair patented claims, both of which are located
	in northern Nevada, which were acquired in October 2015.


	 


	Operationally, the Company intends
	to outsource all of the exploration, site preparation and extraction to a third-party who provides all the manpower, equipment
	and operational expenses associated therewith. The third-party operator will compensate the Company through a royalty equal to
	20% to 30% of the gold reserves recovered and sold by this party from the acquired mining claims noted above. The Company plans
	to retain four full time staff members in various capacities and lease office facilities in California. Legal, accounting, shareholder
	relations and geology will be outsourced to consultants as needed. Business development for the Company will be limited to developing
	and maintaining a website presence, nominal travel and business expense


	 



	Note 2: Summary of Significant
	Accounting Policies



	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim
	financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and should be read in conjunction
	with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s annual report filed with the SEC on its
	10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation
	of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results
	of operations for our interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to
	the financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the
	year ended September 30, 2015, as reported in the Form S-1, have been omitted.


	 


	As shown in the accompanying
	financial statements, the Company has limited cash and no revenues and has accumulated a deficit of $288,612 as of June 30, 2016.  These
	factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  Management intends
	to seek additional capital from new equity securities offerings and short-term borrowings if necessary that will provide funds
	needed to increase liquidity and fully implement its business plan.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
	be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.



	Note 3: Equity Transactions



	 


	On October 28, 2015, the Company
	entered into an “Asset Purchase Agreement by and between Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. and Humboldt Mining Company, Inc.”
	This agreement required the Company to issue 13,500,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for certain land and mining claims.
	The Company assumed $44,200 of certain liabilities from the seller.


	 


	On September 30, 2015, the Company
	entered into an “Equity Purchase Agreement” with Kodiak Capital Group, LLC (“Kodiak”) whereby Kodiak can
	purchase up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock. The stock would be sold for a price equal to the closing bid price
	for the Company’s common stock on the principal market on a trading day as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P. The Company
	issued 3,000,000 shares of its common stock to Kodiak Capital as commitment shares under the Equity Purchase Agreement (the
	“Commitment Fee Shares”).


	 


	The Company issued the Commitment
	Fee Shares on February 10, 2016. In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, on April 28, 2016, the Company provided to Kodiak
	a termination notice and the Company is now in the process of effecting the return or cancellation of the Commitment Fee Shares,
	as well as pursuing any other available legal remedies.


	 



	Note 4: Note Payable



	 


	On June 28

	th

	, the Company
	entered into an agreement by and between Rancho Santa Fe Mining, Inc. and Lucosky Brookman, LLP for the financing of attorney
	fees of $27,500 for legal services. The Company has signed a 12% demand note payable to record this transaction.


	 



	Note 5: Related Party Transactions



	 


	As of June 30, 2016 funding for the expenses of the company have been paid by the officers
	and major shareholders. The amount of these payments is $228,743 and is reflected in the Accounts payable – related
	parties line in the balance sheet.

                About Us                















The Story of Gold Rush Expeditions – From then ’til now.
It all started with George Thompson and a book called “Some Dreams Die” in 1988. The book is basically a treasure hunter’s handbook, George set up grand images of mining days gone by and the lost treasures buried by miners, Indians, and other outlaws.
In 1989, Driver’s license in one hand and a well read, dog-eared copy of “Some Dreams Die”, Corey set out to find these lost treasures. Endless days and long starry nights were spent wandering and exploring the hills of Utah’s remote and unforgiving west Desert. Days were spent matching lore with real maps and history and then finding and documenting the old areas. One aspect became clear and consistent with each discovery, everything was tied to mining sites. That lead to a different search. What was this mining thing, and why was it nearly dead for the average person today?
History is pretty clear that the west was settled on one concept. Mining. Anyone could be a prospector. These prospectors combed the hills and sometimes made a strike. Farmers and Ranchers followed, feeding the miners. This was the start of a community. Soon a small town would form, because Americans are capitalists if anything, and these miners and ranchers, needed supplies. As the mines expanded, so did the towns. Soon there were rail lines. Be aware that the cross country rail lines were not built for the people and tourism of the Nation. No, they were built to transport massive loads of gold and silver ores to mills and plants.
These towns would flourish from mining. Schools, hospitals and more would pop up in support of the mining operations. In many cases, when the mines died out for whatever reasons, the towns would fade as well. It’s a story that can be seen all over the west even today.
Corey found it intriguing that most every town in Utah could be traced back to mining. Even Brigham Young and his band of Mormons were only able to survive by selling wares to the people who passed along on their way to the gold fields of Nevada, or the Gold Rush lands of California. Yet very little mining was happening today. 
Over the years, Corey couldn’t help but notice more and more historic mining sites vanishing from the landscape. Tunnels and drifts that made up the being of many men’s lives were backfilled and bulldozed. The history completely destroyed and the mines and their locations becoming lost knowledge.
A bit of investigation showed that this history was being viciously destroyed by our own US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management through their Abandoned Mine Reclamation Programs. No concern for history or the heritage of a mine camp that had been tucked away for 100 years in a long forgotten canyon. No concern for the men still mining their claims on the weekend for some extra money.
The mission of these agencies is nothing less than the eradication of mining from the face of the land. Entire historic mine camps from the 1800s through the great depression are/were being burned and bulldozed at an alarming rate. This destruction included mills, ore bins, trusses, and cabins. These historic mines where people had built a life, were being completely erased from the landscape, never to be seen again.
Utah Division of Oil Gas and Mining Director John Baza said it best, “It’s time to erase the scar of mining from this land”.
One week these abandoned mining camps would be there, the next week there would be an empty bulldozed piece of land. No history, no remembrance of the men and women who worked, slept and may have died there. The concept of wiping out the history of these people and what they built through mining was completely unacceptable. Corey was determined to do something about it, and so Gold Rush Expeditions was born.
Today Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. combs the historic maps and documents locating valuable and historic mining sites that are still standing. As a company, we have come to learn that mining is not dead. Many mines hold millions and sometimes billions of dollars in gold and gem reserves. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. locates these sites and documents them thoroughly. Then offering them up for sale, providing opportunities for mining to grow and live again. Mining has been around since the beginning of time, and it’s not too difficult to make a living like thousands of miners have done over the years.
“We find ’em you mine ’em”, that pretty much sums it up. Over the years Gold Rush Expeditions have become experts at finding the best available mines in the West and then documenting and presenting those mines to the public. GRE takes care of all of the paperwork with the BLM and simplifies the process. Then we show you what you need to do to mine it. Our legal team helps you through all of the steps of permitting and turning your mining operation into a working, producing mine. 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. also sponsors the National Bureau of Mines. A repository of every mine and mine site that they have documented over the years. The goal is to educate people about America’s mining heritage, remind us all that we come from tough stock. People who were both dreamers and doers. Highlighting the incredible feats they accomplished. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc wants to bring back the Gold Rush. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. wants these mining sites to be around for future generations to learn from and enjoy.
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. formally formed as an incorporated entity in 2004. Since that time they have grown exponentially, evolving into a powerful force restoring mining as a way of life.
Mining Today
Today the opportunity for mining is greater than it has ever been. Old mines that were abandoned when gold mining was made illegal by the War Act are still out there. These mines provided more than a living, they provided independence and freedom.  Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. locates mines throughout the West. These mines are ready to work with rich veins visible and ores exposed. While regulations have increased, the tools and ability to process the ore from these historic mines are more effective than ever.
While each year more and more mines are erased from our landscape, Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. is racing against the destruction. We are out documenting the old mines in the backcountry of the West. Researching, Surveying and filing Claims on the valuable sites.
These Mines were America’s past success and with a little work, they are America’s future success. Gold Rush envisions the transition, a generation of paper pushing, computer terminal warriors being transformed into an army of miners. Creating their own future and prosperity working underground, digging out gold and gems. 
Over the years Gold Rush has seen that we are not alone. There are many miners in waiting, snapping up these sites as quickly as we can locate them.
Gold Rush is playing a small part in helping Americans to remember and appreciate their past. This while offering an opportunity to work the mines and provide a good living for themselves.
“It’s a 21st century Gold Rush. If our kids and their kids have something to look back on, then we are accomplishing what we have set out to do.”
 
A Crash Course on Abandoned Mine Reclamation
Back in the 1970’s the nation’s mining heritage dotted, if not covered, the landscape of the Western States. An estimated 115 to 120 thousand of these old abandoned mines were found scattered throughout the West. Their head frames and waste piles provided a glimpse into the Nation’s past. Today there are still some surviving mines on federal lands, but most of those will be gone in a few decades. The loss of Western mining heritage will accelerate in the coming years, rather than diminish. Not because of the gradual effects of wind, weather, and vandals, but primarily due to government reclamation programs. In 1977, Congress passed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act which taxes active coal mines. The funds were meant to fix safety hazards and environmental problems from two centuries of coal mining, but increasingly the funds are applied towards eliminating historic hard rock mines in the West. Since the passage of the Act in 1977, $7.2 billion has been spent by the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) to reclaim old mines that have been deemed “hazardous”. The history of these landmarks is gone forever. Never to be seen again.
Why the BLM and FS are Bent on Closing Abandoned Mines
The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service claim that they are bulldozing old mining sites for public safety, which is a believable story until you look at the numbers. From 2013 to 2014, there were only 4 deaths across the United States attributed to abandoned mines. In 2012 there were 15 deaths attributed to abandoned mines. In 2011, there were 5 deaths attributed to abandoned mines. In relation, there are approximately 10 people PER DAY that die while swimming in lakes and rivers across the US. That is over 3,500 people per year. So why isn’t there more of a focus on lake and river safety?
Follow the money. They have the money to spend and it’s use it or risk losing it. There also seems to be an underlying current among the BLM and Forest Service to reclaim much of the land in the West to its primitive state. It appears that the BLM and Forest service use the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to reclaim mines and the Endangered Species Act to close large swaths of land with the same goal, to keep the public from using the land.
Why it is Important to Preserve our Mining Heritage
The destruction of these historic landmarks is alarming. We are actively destroying our heritage. We are standing on the shoulders of giants and at the same time, our government organizations are determined to erase all evidence that these giants ever existed. When we remember the struggles that our predecessors went through and the obstacles they overcame we begin to see that we are part of a larger narrative. It gives us added strength. We become more resilient and better able to deal with the challenges in our own lives. The ingenuity, resourcefulness and the stick to it mentality of these old miners are absolutely amazing. Here they were far from civilization, making their living cutting tunnels and bringing out gold. They built small towns with whatever resources they could find. They crossed the plains and built every mining town from Leadville, Colorado, and Virginia City, Nevada, to Butte Montana. They were independent and hardworking dreamers, who in very essence built the West. Thomas Paine wrote, over 200 years ago, “What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly”. In a bigger sense when we forget the price that was paid for the rise of this nation and the struggles that we overcame to get where we are; we esteem our current position too lightly and we risk losing what our ancestors worked so hard to gain. One of the main reasons we work so hard to preserve these old mines is so that we have the physical reminders of the contributions of those who went before us.
 
In Corey’s own words, “It’s a wild ride. I never expected to see so many mining enthusiasts. We’ve had our fair share of tough times, but I have no regrets. This is what I love doing, and the more mines I can save and put into production, the bigger the chance that these mines and their history will be preserved. The best part is seeing the number of people who are able to make a good living, working mines that would have otherwise been destroyed.”

                Services                















Claim Filing
We also offer land status verification, which involves hand checking the plat maps and verifying all of the status against state lands, Indian lands and other withdrawals.
GRE, Inc. will guarantee accuracy in paperwork and submission with all respective counties and governing bodies in relation with mining claims.
Average time for client to receive all paperwork on claims including deeds and documentation is 45-60 business days. This time allows us to make sure that all issues have been resolved and your claim is unencumbered.











Geology Surveys And Samples
Maybe you just want an underground survey with samples. Our trained surveyors will document the exposed veins and lodes in the mine and extract samples from those ore bodies. These to be delivered directly to the claim owner or to one of our trusted Assayers. All samples are the property of the claim owner and are held strictly confidential.
Maybe you need some deep drilling and core sampling? We can do that as well. Drilling and core sample extractions are contracted out to GRE trusted companies.











Mine Exploration
Underground exploration can be dangerous. Our teams utilize both oxygen and gas meters to monitor air quality and are trained to safely navigate the inner workings of underground operations. Exploration occurs to the extent that is viably safe for the Surveyor to do so. In the case of re-opening closed mines, we require at least 30 days lead time for the mine to clear of “dead air”.
If it is determined that the mine cannot be safely documented, there will be a $100 survey fee. This fee will include pictures of the site from outside the mine and surrounding area. Underground exploration is billed at $1 per foot. Excavation services are on a case by case quote. Mine owner is responsible for any permits required from state to state.











Notice Of Intent / Operation
A solid notice of operation is the cornerstone of any mining operation. We offer our expertise and years of experience to help you write an effective Notice that gets approved. We have written over 100 Notices of Intent/Operation that have all been successfully approved by Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management agencies.

HomeFrequently Asked Questions 

                Frequently Asked Questions                















General Questions



Why does Gold Rush Expeditions sell mining claims instead of working them themselves?
Our mission is to preserve mining history and to reestablish the glory days of mining. That has been our goal from the very beginning. Thousands of mine sites are destroyed across the West each year by the BLM, Forest Service and other land managers. Every mine we claim and sell can be moved off of that list of “Abandoned Mines” and thus preserved. We seek to document and preserve the work that made the West what it is today.
If Gold Rush stopped to “work” these mines, we would not be able to document and procure new sites. We would become strictly a mining company. That’s not who we are, and not what we do. We sell mines with visible veins of gold or gems every day. The mission of Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc is not to mine these sites. To coin a phrase, “We find ’em, You mine ’em!” 
 




Can I look at a claim site and test some samples before I buy?
Absolutely, but we do require a signed non-disclosure/confidentiality agreement prior to disclosing the location of sites. We do this because we spend a lot of time locating these sites and believe they have value, and often times the new claimant does not want a lot of people wandering around their claim after purchase.
In the case of claims listed on our website, we can hold a claim for seven days, with a nonrefundable deposit of $500.00. If you decide to purchase the claim, the $500.00 can then be used towards your purchase. We can also provide you with authorization to remove up to 100 lbs of sample.




How does Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. determine the price for each claim?
There are a variety of elements that determine the pricing of a particular mining claim or block of mining claims. For your information, here are some of the elements that are taken into consideration:
Mineral Content:
The surveyors themselves look through any available tailings to find evidence of precious metals. They inspect the ores and veins personally, and report the visible presences of any valuable minerals. It doesn’t get any more direct than that! The surveyors are looking for minerals that can be taken by hand in many cases. They bypass many mines with “microscopic gold” or “sulphide minerals” because they are difficult to extract value from. That is the reason you see Gold Rush mines stating “free milling gold” or visible gems and deposits. While our historical research is extensive and painstaking, we don’t solely rely on that second hand information. We validate and verify, right on site.
Scarcity/Rarity:
Contrary to popular belief, there are many mines out there with substantial mineral reserves and values. With that in mind, Mines are being destroyed by the BLM and Forest Service on a daily basis. 40 years ago, you could find a good producing mine in any variety of districts across the west. Not today. With reclamation becoming a business for the government, closures are more prevalent. Usable, mining claims are becoming more scarce. For instance, in a county or a district with high gold values but very few viable mines, those mines will have increased value. Our goal is to find a mine that is still intact, preferably not reclaimed, that can be worked profitably under casual use with no government interference. There are a lot of factors to take into consideration, we judge them all and pass the information to you.
Location:
Location in a key mining district or region is vital to pricing of a claim. If the mine is located in a gulch or drainage, it may rank higher. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc surveyors will often overlook mines that are right off the highway. No one wants to deal with lots of passerby’s unless the mine is completely stunning and secure. 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc’s ideal sites are large, remote and undisturbed with substantial documentation. Even though a more remote mine will rank high, it’s not much good to you if you cannot build a road to it. Another element of the critique is if the claim is easily accessible by road or trail. A mine that is inaccessible, cannot ship out ores, and its thus going to rank low on our scale.
Environment:
The next element that is addressed are factors in the climate and environment in general. We look at the available resources on the site and make note if there’s any shelter, water, or timber.
Having year round water is often pivotal, and shelter is more than necessary when the sun is beating down on you. Some older mines will have remnants of old structures, and that can prove useful to a miner. Whether it’s providing shelter in a cabin, or utilizing an old mill. Sometimes it is easier and cheaper to utilize existing structures than building new.
Also as part of environment we consider the aesthetics. Is the mine itself awe inspiring? Does it have a special and unique look to it that you can’t quite find anywhere else? Does it have character? Does it have an interesting story? 
Market:
All of the elements above put together a good picture of the market for specific mines and properties. This market will fluctuate slightly from year to year, but similar to real estate, it always seems to grow. As mining companies and small miners pay more for claims, the values of others will grow. Naturally, history can attest to how valuable a mine is, records of the mine producing gold and/or other precious metals. The general trend is a positive one, where the exact mine claim that sold in 2008 for $50k, today will sell for over $110k in most regions. That’s not a bad trend!




Does Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc offer leases and/or shared ventures?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. does not often enter into shared ventures. But there are rare occasions where we have been able to assist small miners in getting their operations up and running for a share of the smelter returns. 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc does offer leases on many of its higher priced mining claim blocks. This is to assist the smaller miner with start up costs. We require an initial deposit and monthly lease payments. This is also predicated upon 10% return of net smelter returns.




Can I sell my mining claim through Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc.?
Yes! Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can help you sell your mining claims. We will even do all the work for you if required. There are specific criteria that must be met to meet the Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. standards. For more information, please give us a call at: 385-218-2138 or email us: goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com






Purchasing



What sort of payment options does Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. accept?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can accept credit/debit cards for monthly payments, deposits and down payments for a maximum amount of $500.00.
For payment of a purchase, we can only accept Personal Checks, Wire Transfers, Money Orders, Cashier’s Checks or other certified funds. Please be aware that mining claims are considered real property, and as such, the payments must be secured.
We do take cash if delivered in person to our main office. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. also accepts certified (stamped) silver and gold bullion for payment. Spot Pricing determines the value given for silver and gold. This fluctuates throughout the normal business day, and can be tracked on websites such as http://www.kitco.com/ Kitco website. Spot pricing is defined at the time of acceptance at the GRE offices.
We do not accept payments through PayPal. PayPal considers mining claims to be real property and their company policies don’t permit them to process transactions regarding real property.




Can I pay for my claim with ore collected from the claim?
No, we do not accept raw ores as a form of payment. Ores must be processed by a reputable source. They are then stamped with a weight and purity. Once the ores have been processed to this point they are referred to as bullion, and can be accepted at spot pricing.




What paperwork will I get after purchasing a mining claim from GRE?
You will receive a Quit Claim deed, showing transfer of ownership of the claim and all of the associated paperwork, images and documentation of the claim.
The Deed transfers the mineral rights from GRE to the new owner. The Deed is created and submitted to the appropriate State and Federal agencies.
You can expect to receive a New Claim Owner Welcome packet within 14 days of full payment. The welcome packet includes:

Land status map of the claim
Original copy of the Quit Claim Deed
National Bureau of Mines Claim Certificates
Digital copies of:

Land status map of the claim
Map showing GPS coordinates of the claim corner markers
All Pictures of the claim and underground images of the mine(s) where applicable
Notice of Location/Certificate of Location with BLM and county recorded stamp
Copy of the Signed Purchase Agreement
Guide to permitted mining operations (State Specific)


A copy of the Quit Claim Deed that has been recorded by the County and BLM will be emailed to you when returned from the County and BLM





Can I change the name of my claim after purchase?
Yes. A  mining claim Name can be modified by submitting an amended NOL/COL to the appropriate county and state BLM. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can also provide this service for a nominal cost.




Who can own a mining claim?
Mining Claims are limited in ownership by US Citizenship. Any US Citizen can own a mining company. Additionally, any US based company can take ownership of mining claims. In the case of international companies, those companies must be approved to do business in the Unites States.






Financing



What is the required down payment for financing a claim with GRE?
Mining Claim Financing is offered at a rate of 0% APR (annual percentage rate) for the first 6 months. If the claim is not paid off within 6 months a 9% APR (annual percentage rate) will be applied to the total claim price from the date of contract execution. If you would like to finance a claim, basic terms are a minimum of 25% down. A documentation fee of $349.00 per claim and $249 for each additional claim is added to this down payment. If buyer is over 30 days late, claim falls into default and reverts back to GRE with no return of any funds paid. We will not file collections, but we will not return funds.  Financing limited to one (1) buyer for one (1) site (in the case of multiple claims on a single site) at any given time. Buyer will have full access to the claim under casual use guidelines. More details on financing will be sent to those who are approved for financing.

Auctions and eBay



Do you sell mining claims on eBay?
We do offer limited mining claims for purchase through eBay and other auction sites.
Our surveyors document a large number of claims each month. We only file and stake so many mining claims and reserve the best of the best for our website and customers. 
We do file claims on some mining claims that for various reasons do not meet the strict guidelines to be listed on our website. In such cases, these claims are liquidated to eBay or other auction sites.
These claims are still good and valid mining claims, and also carry the Gold Rush Guarantee.
 




If I am blocked from bidding can I become unblocked?
There are many reasons for eBay bidders to be blocked from participation in Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. auctions. The most common block is due to non-payment. If you have been banned from our auctions for non-payment or another reason, your bid will not be accepted. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. reserves the right to block bidders who have not paid on previous eBay claim purchases or any other reason at our sole discretion.
If you are a bidder with a feedback rating of less than 10, you will receive an email from Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. to confirm your identity. If your identity cannot be verified, you will likely be blocked. In most cases, you can resolve this with a quick call to our offices at 385-218-2138. Removing a bidder from the blocked list may take up to 24 hours. 






Mining Claims



What exactly am I getting with an Mineral Claim?
An unpatented lode claim gives the claimant complete ownership of all minerals and gems located within the confines of the mining claim. 
Lode Mineral Claims give ownership of minerals that are located in their original location or amalgamated in a host rock.
Placer Mineral Claims give ownership of valuable minerals or gems that have been displaced from their original lodes and can be found in gravels or riverbeds. Placer claims usually apply to the topmost 18 inches of gravel or sands.
All unpatented mineral claim rights are subject to annual renewal. Plainly put, If you do not renew your claim annually, those rights will revert back to the US Federal Government. Keep your mining claim active and valid by paying your annual assessments before September 1st of each year.
Ownership of a mining claim, either placer or lode does not, by default, convey or imply ownership or interest in any BUILDINGS, MACHINERY or other EQUIPMENT that is found within the boundaries of the claim. In the case of many mining claims, it is possible to take control of the buildings, machinery or other items by filing a Notice of Operation and utilizing the  items in conjunction with or to promote your mineral extraction operation. 
Use of any implement, building or machine on the mineral claim may not violate the Antiquities Act of 1906. Any items that have been undisturbed (undisturbed means that the item has not been moved or utilized in any manner) for over 50 years are subject to the Antiquities Act and any movement or removal of said items is a violation of federal law.
When in doubt, please inquire. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. has years of experience and we can provide answers to any questions that may arise.




How do I keep my claim active?
All mining claims must be renewed each year with the appropriate county and Bureau of Land Management. This is done in one of two ways:

Pay an annual assessment fee and record and register your claim with the County and Bureau of Land Management before September 1st of each year.  
Document improvements made to your claim and submit a waiver to the county and Bureau of Land Management.

Annual assessment fees are the fees paid to the Department of the Interior to maintain ownership of your property. Annual Assessment fees are subject to change. In 2015 and 2016, the cost to renew a single, 20 acre lode or placer claim was $155.00. Please call us for current pricing.
Assessment fees or Annual Maintenance for unpatented claims are due by September 1st of every year, no exceptions. Claims that are not renewed by September 1st will revert back to federal ownership.
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can assist with the Annual Assessment process to ensure that you retain ownership of your claim each year.




Can an unpatented claim be changed to a patented claim?
No, not at this time. There is currently a moratorium on patenting mining claims. This was signed in by President Bill Clinton in 1994 specifically to hinder mining efforts in the United States. Until this moratorium is lifted,  it is not currently possible to patent (gain full ownership of the land) an unpatented mining claim.




How many claims can an individual own?
There is no limit to the number of claims you can own. In order to file a small miner waiver for annual assessments, you cannot own over 10 claims.




How long does a mining claim remain active?
Indefinitely, provided that the annual assessment payments are kept current. These annual assessments must be completed by September 1st of each year.




Weren't most mines abandoned because they were all mined out?
It may come as a surprise, but most mines were not abandoned due to lack of production or minerals. There are many reasons that mines were abandoned. The most common are related to regulation and are as follows:

The “Silver Crash” of 1891-3. Federal support for purchase of silver and silver ores was removed in 1891. The value of silver dropped from over $1 per ounce to $0.27 per ounce in 1893, stabilizing at an average of $0.79 by the end of the year. This equated to a cut of more than 30%. (Consider the impact that losing 30% of your income tomorrow would have on your own economy.) As a result, many silver mines were mothballed while waiting for the price to rise to previous levels of $1 per ounce.
During WWI and WWII many left their mines to either fight in the war or help support the war effort by working in other industries.
In 1941, President Roosevelt made it illegal to pursue the mining of any minerals except those considered strategic. This act was known as the War Act, and its intent was to cripple the mining industry, while providing man power for WWII. 418,000 men never returned from WWII. This left their mining operations abandoned. In addition, over 300,000 were wounded, left permanently disabled and were unable to return to their mines.  Many men after WWII never returned to their mines.
In the years after WWII, the federal government bolstered efforts to encourage people to work in the cities and offices of the nation. 
Since the repeal of the War Act in 1945, Mining activity decreased over 400%. These mines were left abandoned because people died or were no longer able to work their mines. Many more people held their mining claims while they worked their city jobs from 9-5, all the while promising to return to mining at some point. Most never did, and when they died, or stopped paying on their claims, they were considered abandoned.





Where can I get raw ore processed?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. recommends the Paradine Mill in Montana for processing your ore. There are also a good number of mills that can process ores in Nevada and Arizona.
A good mine should be able to offset the costs of logistics by producing rich ores. 
For more information, please call our office at 385-218-2138 during normal business hours.






Working your Claim



Can I build a cabin or other structure on my claim?
Yes, but only with an approved Notice of Operation. Your building will need to be in direct support of your mining operation. You will likely be assessed a bond that insures that you will remove the cabin when you leave the claim.
You can make improvements to current structures on the claim with an approved notice of intent or notice of operations. The improvements must be in support of mining operations.




How far can I tunnel outside my claim boundaries?
As far as you want, as long as you don’t breach the surface. You have virtually unlimited rights underground provided your workings do not surface at any time outside of your claim boundaries. In the case of your workings surfacing outside your claim boundaries, another party could claim that portion of the workings. The legal owner of those workings would be the claimant which controls the apex of the lode on their claim.




I got a letter/notice from the BLM or FS, what do I do? 
You usually have 30 days from receipt of the letter to respond. If you do not respond in that time frame you may lose your rights.
What you need to do depends on what the letter says. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can assist you in responding to these notices. If you require assistance with a BLM or FS issue, please call our offices at 385-218-2138 to see how we can help.




 Can I live on my claim?
The word “live” implies doing things possibly not incident to or reasonably related to mining. You can’t “live” on your claim, but you can prospect and mine it. Residency not reasonably incident to mining is not allowed. If it is reasonable to pack up mining gear and go back to a town or campground, you will be expected to do that, rather than stay more than 14 days straight on your claim. However if it is approved in your Notice of Operations, then yes you can remain on your claim for however many days you listed in your approved Notice of Operations.




 Are there public utilities (power, water, etc.) that I can use on the claim?
On rare occasion, there are public utilities near or on the property. If public utilities are present you can contact the utility company for set up requirements.




Can Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. provide help to those new to mining?
There is a lot of information that we can help the beginning miner with. This from permitting to logistics and processing. If you need help, give us a call (385-218-2138 ) or email goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com, let us know what you need and we can help you put it together. 
There are also volumes of information available on mining basics in the form of old mining books. For a list a recommended books please contact our offices. Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. can answer specific questions regarding mining basics and operations. Email your specific questions to goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com




Where can I buy equipment to mine with? 
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. is very particular about who we work with. For this reason we only make recommendations we can stand behind.
Global Mining Equipment is an all American provider of all your mining equipment or needs. If you need it, Global has it. Global Mining Equipment comes highly recommended by Gold Rush Expeditions Inc.




I bought a claim from someone else, can Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. verify the validity of that claim?
Yes, we can research and report on the validity of your claim. This is charged per hour based on the current Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. office services rate. Call 385-218-2138 or email goldrush@goldrushexpeditions.com for more information.






Gold



Why do people attach so much value to Gold?
Gold is one of the rarest elements on the planet earth. It has been used as currency and for trade since the dawn of recorded history. It is a solid, tangible asset that can be used to purchase, barter or trade for most any item.




How does gold differ from pyrite?
Pyrite is a derivative of iron. Pyrite often occurs in gold lodes. Old Spanish prospectors lived by the motto: “Gold rides an iron horse”. Meaning that where you find heavy concentrations of iron, you will find gold.
If you find something that you think is gold. Use the knife method to verify. Gold is mallable, it will feel soft. You can gouge it with a knife but it will not scratch. Pyrite on the other hand is a more crystalline formation and is very hard. If you scratch it with a knife, the surface will mar and become defaced.
Gold and pyrite differ slightly in color, shape, hardness, odor, and malleability. It’s not difficult to tell the two apart once you have seen them side by side. Gold also forms in and with pyrite, in a form known as auferous pyrite. For more information please see:Difference Between Gold and Pyrite




What does gold look like in its native form/in the host rock?
The appearance of gold is dependent on how it is formed. Native gold, in a good mine, will look exactly like what it is. Gold. Gold is soft. It can be “dented” with the tip of a knife or other hard object. Gold is also globulus, meaning it is not crystalline, it will not have hard edges, or any crystal formations.
Native Gold is also called “Free Gold”, or “Free Milling Gold”, this  refers to gold that can be crushed and panned out. By crushing the rock, you will break the gold out of it. It can then be panned out with water or other chemicals. 
Gold can also be microscopic and invisible to the naked eye. Unless you are planning a pit mine processing thousands of tons per day, microscopic gold is as good as no gold.
Gold often runs with quartz. Gold also alloys with metals such as copper, iron and silver.
An old miner adage is that that you always want to be on the look out for one of the 4 metals, which always occur together, those being: Gold, Silver, Copper and Platinum. The concentrations may vary, but this is a very accurate statement. This is why there are a lot of mines named “The 4 Metals”.




Where can I find the current price on Gold/Silver?
Gold Rush Expeditions, Inc. recommends Kitco.com. Kitco website.

I really like this claim, it is one of the nicest you have offered. I loved it the last time it was available. I’d just like to add; Corey, you and your crew are awesome. You have provided a great deal of information on mining and prospecting and have been professional and upstanding to the utmost. You are helping to make the dream come true for many. Have a great day.

You can’t go wrong buying a mine from GRE, They are honest and accurate with their details. I can’t say enough so nuf’ said

by Don Wotherspoon
 






Last spring I bought a lode mining claim in southern Arizona from Gold Rush Expeditions (GRE). I purchased this claim from GRE because I felt that they were a reputable, professional company. In September I received a notice from BLM that they wanted an amendment to the Notice of Location that had previously been accepted by the county and BLM, or else they would terminate my claim. I contacted GRE and they quickly responded to this regulatory change by BLM and submitted amendments to the county and BLM, which have been recorded successfully. It is one thing to have a company complete a sale and accept your funds. It is another to have that company come through for you after the sale when it matters.

I highly recommend GRE as a competent company with integrity. I would go back to them again in the future.

We have done business with Gold Rush almost since the inception.  We have purchased and/or sold numerous claims with Gold Rush and have always had a very pleasant purchasing and selling experience... Phone calls, emails, and messages have always been handled in prompt, courteous manner... 
We would recommend Gold Rush Expeditions to our valued customers and friends as having a highly respectful and honest organization... "You need not worry as their word tends to be their BOND"...

When GRE says that they want satisfied customers, it's not just words. They prove it with actions that go beyond normal business practices. So this is a shout out to them .....Kudos for all.

I have bought other claims from individuals that were later forfeited to the BLM because of a failure by the previous owners to file the proper paperwork. I was able to reclaim the claims, but what a pain and waste of time and money. I know when I purchase a claim from Gold Rush Expeditions the claim is solid and your support team is there if assistance is needed. I would especially recommend purchasing claims from Gold Rush Expeditions to someone who is new to prospecting. I am waiting for the weather to cooperate a little more before going to the claim, but I feel like I have already been there by way of your video. I hope to purchase more claims from Gold Rush Expeditions in the future.

GRE has answered my questions and some I didn't have. Very nice to work with. Easy communication and fast service. I would highly recommend them for a mine purchase.
