Job Details
               Patriot Financial Partners, L.P. is a private equity firm focused on investing in community banks, thrifts and financial service related companies throughout the United States. Patriot's objective is to provide superior risk-adjusted returns by applying a hands-on, value-added investment model to non-control investments within the community banking sector, which consists of more than 1,000 public and privately-held depository institutions that have between $500 million and $5 billion of assets. Portfolio companies must have strong management teams with successful track records. Patriot is looking for banks with demonstrated growth in assets, loans and core deposits; a strong credit culture, growth in net income and acceptable levels of capital. Typically, as banks grow, their financial performance improves due to economies of scale. Therefore, the fund is designed to provide growth capital to companies allowing them to grow and achieve top quartile peer level financial performance, thereby enhancing shareholder value. The Partners' extensive operating backgrounds in the bank and thrift industry will provide value added knowledge to patriot's company's executives and boards of directors. In addition, Patriot has formed an industry advisory board to provide additional expertise to portfolio company management to help prioritize key business initiatives and implement "best practices" to maximize individual company franchise growth.

                                Report abuseTranscript of progression of apple productsThe progression of Apple iPhones iPhones have been used in are day to day lives for 7 years now. there have been 8 different phones released in that time span. With an amazing 10 software updates.    This logo has changed in many different ways over time. this logo is very different that the one shown before. This logo was used on apple products in 1978-1998 This logo has changed many ways form the first logo that apple chose to use. In this logo there is a pop art theme running throughout the logo with its geometric blocks filled with a wide range of different colours adds to the pop art feel. Also this logo is simple yet effective upon the eye. How has Apple's logo changed?The Progression Of Apple Products.The first iPhone  iPhone 3GThe iPhone 3G was first released in June 2008. This was the first apple product to have the freedom to  chose from two different colours, Black or white. Also this was the first and only apple product to include Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync support this means that you were able to sync you apple product with window products and many different products. Also at this time Apple introduced the use of an app store within there phones. Apple were the first phone company to this in the products.This was the first logo that apple used on there products. This was first used in 1976.This was the very first logo that Apple used in their products. This logo has a complex design. This logo also has a surrealistic feel to it. With it's flowing lines running thought out gives a complex yet elegant design. that compliments the inner picture.      How has Apple's logo changed?How has Apple's logo changed?This logo has change in many ways from the previous logo used by apple. this logo first appeared on the product in 1998.This logo is very similar to the first two logos that apple used on their products. This logo is very similar to the first logo that they used in their products. With is one block colour is simple but still effective.   How has Apple's logo changed?This is the final logo that apple have used on the products. This logo as got a robotic feel to it, with its metal finish with shaded strip though the middle makes it seem metallic and make the logo look more professional and has a creative look to the logo. This is the logo that you will see on all of your apple products from now on.I like this logo over the rest of the logos this is because it has got and simple yet effective design to it. Also it has its futuristic elements running throughout.    This was the original iPhone, this was first released in June 29, 2007. with its 3.5 inch screen this phone was they smallest iPhone that they have released. This phone has a simple design, the curved edges adds to the simple flowing design of the original iPhone. Also with the rapid change in colours creates the feel of a grip and a bold look to the iPhone.      iPhone 3GS The iPhone 3GS was the first phone to ever have the use of cut and past. Not much has changed one the design of the iPhone at this stage it was just a hardware and software update on the phone. Also a new feature on the phone at this time was the use of a video camera, Apple were one of the last to introduce this into there product and this cased them to fall behind with the tech side to there phone.    iPhone 4 At this stage Apple have took a massive leap with the design and software. The fist massive change that Apple did was the shape and feel of the phone. They gave the phone a boxier feel with its flat sides with curved corners this was a massive change from it rounded lower models. The next change was a glass back with is slick and smoothness added to the already modern feel that the phone had.  iPhone 4SNot much has changed at this stage the only change is the use of 'siri'. this is the ability to control your phone with voice commands. This changed phone form there on, all of the well know phone company stated to use this idea all in there new phones. Also Apple added the fist use of the iCloud at this stage this allowed to to save, store and share all different things with other iPhone users.    iPhone 5iPhone 5SThis was the next big leap in the Apple iPhone product.. The larger screen. The 4 inch 'Retina' screen. And the new lightning port. this was the first iPhone to have these two special feature. Also this iPhone 5 when back the the first idea of having the metal back over the glass back with was prone to smashing. The iPhone 5 was such a big hit with people they sold over 5 million on the first 3 days of the release world wide.   iPhone 5c Not much has changed at this stage. The only big difference at  this stage was the use of a finger nt scanner that will allow you to enter you phone effortlessly, with just a scan of the finger. Also at this stage apple started to introduce 4G into there phones and other products. Also There was a another changed in the iPhone range the new colour Gold.  This was a First for apple releasing two iPhone in the same year. this was a big change for Apple they released a phone that you had a chose between five different colored phones. Apple discribed this as a "iPhone Gets a Color Bath". This sums up the whole phone in on line. This is the cheaper of the twp phone that were released in that year, apple also described this as "outstanding phone with a low price tag".   The Future Where do i think Apple will go in the future? There are many different ways that Apple could go with there future products. One of the things that i think apple will do is create a phone that is fully glass that is clear. Also Ithink that the Apple in time will bring a wearable product out, this could be many things one of the many things is a watch, that allows you to accesses all of you files that are on your phone with a watch. Another wearable product that i think appl will bring in is glasses that allow to take images of what you see also research all about your surroundings.        IntroductionWhy have I chosen Apple?The reason for me choosing Apple for my presentation is that I use Apple products in my day to day life. So this means that I know a lot about Apple products. Also I have chosen Apple for my presentation because throughout the years of me using their products I have gained a wide range of information about there products.  Where do people think Apple is going next? The first person that i asked said " Apple has changed so much over the years that i have used there products, i think that they are going to stick with same rectangular shape with the touch scan figure scanner. Also i think that they will add a few new features like a 3D camera things like that." The next person i asked said  " I'm not to sure where apple can go next.. there is many different roomers that i have heard going round but I don't that will come true.. a transforming phone.. come on..." Where do I think that Apple are going to go next? Well there are many different ways that apple could go next one of the big ideas that i have is wearable devises as in watches.Websites http://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/http://www.google.co.uk/#q=iphones+facts+&safe=activehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhonehttp://www.google.co.uk/#q=iphones+facts&safe=activeFull transcriptPopular presentationsSee more popular or the latest prezisPreziProductGalleryThe ScienceConversational PresentingFor BusinessTestimonialsCompanyAboutTeamCareersOur ValuesPressOur CustomersContact UsLanguages
