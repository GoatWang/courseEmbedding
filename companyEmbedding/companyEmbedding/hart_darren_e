This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Darren Randolph: Joe Hart arrival prompted Middlesbrough switch
Vincent De Villiers
Julho 28, 2017

If the West Ham man does move to Newcastle he would have to compete with Rob Elliot for a place in the starting XI but that looks to be a better situation for the Spaniard especially with the extra Premier League experience he would bring potentially giving him an edge.
West Ham had problems in goal a year ago, with both Adrian and Darren Randolph suffering from indifferent form, and the England goalkeeper has been brought in to add presence and organisational ability.He played 22 Premier League games last season as he battled for selection with Adiran and has remained Martin O'Neill's preferred stopper for Ireland, but Randolph admitted Hart's signing signalled the end of his spell in London, and is now targeting game time with Boro and a ticket to Russian Federation with his country.The 29-year-old winger, though, failed to make a huge impact at the London Stadium.

Com isso, os testes fechados começarão apenas em 16 de setembro, e perdurarão até o dia 18 do mesmo mês.  Os jogadores terão acesso a uma versão primária do Hub online, e acesso a nove personagens jogáveis .

The Mirror reported last month that West Ham are looking to offload the Scotland global winger in the summer transfer window, with Middlesbrough, Sunderland and Sheffield Wednesday claimed to be interested in him.Football Insider analyses how West Ham would line-up if they complete the midfielder signing, as well as including their four completed deals in the side to face United on August 13."If things go well and the new signings slot in and the players avoid injuries, then I believe West Ham should be finishing in the top half and challenging for the top eight".The Hammers need to give the Scotsman a full season to show what he is capable of, as it would not be fair on the winger to be dumped after six months.

Testimonials
Nice product.  Easy to use!
Searched on the web and decided to take a chance with getting something to do HART on my PC instead of having to lug around a HART communicator.  We are a Systems Integrator that performs field commissioning all over the world.  My main expertise is PLC programming and field commissioning.  I have to lug around cables, tools, laptops, etc. and the DevCom2000 software and HART modem work out well for me when I do checks from devices back to the PLC.  Since traveling with tools and equipment by airline is a hassle these days, this system has filled a big void without requiring additional baggage.
Your service is very good and your ability to make the customer feel like they are important goes beyond most of the vendors that I deal with.
A lot of the devices I check out are not in easily accessible areas on the skid.  That makes the HART Bluetooth modem especially appealing.  I can climb up to the device, connect it up and it enables me to keep my computer on the ground and not in awkward positions.  Since my laptop is my livelihood, keeping it safe, sound, and secure is very important.
Used every day since purchase.  Very useful!
The system has been one of the best field service aids that I have purchased.  Previously we had to share HART communicators and we only had two.  There are six people in our organization that do the majority of field work, so we were priority shipping the communicators all over the country.  The DevCom2000 software and HART modem bring the system price to the level where everyone in a field service organization can have one.  Great product, great support!
My company has several of the systems now and they become a HOT item when going out to the field.  It has saved us many hours of checkout/startup time.
I want to thank ProComSol because the factory support I have received has been outstanding.  This is one of the things that I like to tell everyone when showing the system because good factory support is becoming harder to obtain.  Keep up the good work!
