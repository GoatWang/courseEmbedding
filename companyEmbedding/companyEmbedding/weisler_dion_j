Whitman on Q3 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript» Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) Meg Whitman on Q2 2015 Results - Earnings Call TranscriptGood day and welcome to the first quarter 2016 HP, Inc. earnings conference call. My name is Denise, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.Diana Sroka - Director-Investor RelationsGood afternoon. I'm Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP, Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer.Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations webpage at www.HP.com.As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release.With that, I'll hand it over to Dion.Dion J. Weisler - President, Chief Executive Officer & DirectorThank you, Diana. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for dialing in today.We've completed the first quarter as HP, Inc. And while we continue to face macroeconomic and market headwinds, we are executing to the plan we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting [SAM] last September.We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range. We returned more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders through our planned quarterly dividend and aggressive share buybacks, taking advantage of the stock price.And while revenue continued to be challenged by market contraction in PCs and core printing, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in APJ and in strategic growth segments of the portfolio, including commercial mobility, retail solutions, graphics, and services.Cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations, driven by changes in working capital, which was impacted by lower personal systems volume. We've taken immediate actions to stay on track to deliver our full-year commitment. Cathie will walk you through those details in just a few minutes.As you consider our financial performance for the quarter, remember that we operate in mature markets. This is an environment where we know how to win, gain share, and out-execute our competitors.A key driver of success in competitive markets is product innovation and differentiation. Innovation is the life blood of HP. This year at CES, we had an outstanding show of new products and took home more than a dozen awards for products like the EliteBook Folio, the world's thinnest and lightest business class notebook. Demonstrating the consumerrization of IT, we took best of show for a business class product because it has the rugged features needed for mobile workers, but the sleek and the stylish design that, let's face it, we all want.As the global commercial PC leader, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, and it's exciting to see the market's reaction to our progress. Earlier this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we announced the HP Elite x3, a revolutionary category-creating mobile solution that brings together mobility and computing in a truly meaningful way. Some in the industry are calling it a new standard for commercial mobility. Running the Windows 10 Mobile platform, the HP Elite x3 unites phablet, laptop, and desktop experiences into a single device. Along with its accessories, it's truly the one device that's every device, enabling users to scale from simple texting to spreadsheets and PowerPoint to utilizing corporate applications. With our strong channel partners and the latest advancements from Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Salesforce, we are turning the promise of mobile productivity into reality for our business customers.In Printing, we launched the PageWide XL product in our graphics portfolio for our initial entry into the technical production market. These fast, large-format mono and color printers are expected to disrupt a $1 billion market and achieve a leading share position.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com

Who is Dion Weisler? | Fortune.comSearchSearchTeslaTesla Model 3: Everything You Need to KnowTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantDion Weisler, newly named CEO of the forthcoming HP Inc. Courtesy: Hewlett-PackardHewlett-PackardWho is Dion Weisler?Katherine NoyesOct 21, 2014"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer" has long been a guiding rule in the military and corporate worlds. It also helps explain the choice of Dion Weisler to lead HP Inc., the printer and personal computer business that Hewlett-Packard (hpq) plans to split off next year. Currently executive vice president of HP’s Printing and Personal Systems business, Weisler spent many years at Acer and Lenovo—the latter arguably HP's most formidable competitor in the PC business today. For HP Inc., it's important to keep that knowledge in-house as it sets out on its own.There's little doubt Weisler, 47, is going to need every advantage he can get in his upcoming new role. PC shipments are on a downward trend, margins are slim, and Lenovo has been padding its lead as the No. 1 vendor, with HP trailing behind. HP's lacking strength in mobile technologies only adds to the pressure."The choices that Dion makes over the next few years will be critical to HP’s long-term success in the PPS space," says Crawford Del Prete, chief research officer at IDC, the market research firm. "They can’t afford to 'overprovision' the market with various devices, yet at the same time, we think they need to expand in their ability to provide a more holistic experience to managing the mobile experience."RelatedFortune 500Meg Whitman Cedes One of Her HPE Titles To This ExecFortune 500Meg Whitman Cedes One of Her HPE Titles To This ExecBefore taking on his current role, Australia-born Weisler served as senior vice president and managing director of HP's Printing and Personal Systems group for the Asia-Pacific and Japan region. Weisler is credited with helping to turn Acer into a firm that "scared the other OEMs half to death," says Rob Enderle, principal analyst with Enderle Group. Weisler is also seen as instrumental to Lenovo’s success in the category. At HP, "he turned the PC unit from a liability into an asset in a few short months," Enderle says.Weisler's international experience is one of his greatest strengths, Stephen Nigro, senior vice president of HP's Inkjet and Graphics Business, told Fortune. "He also has a lot of experience in managing businesses in multiple product categories. Personally, he's a very detailed and fact-based sort of individual. Also, he likes to win. You want someone leading who wants to win and has competitive fire."Weisler, who holds a bachelor's degree in computing from Australia's Monash University, is famous for using surfing analogies to describe his strategic vision, Nigro says. He has long been an avid swimmer and used to swim competitively. "Dion is very engaging and has brought a refreshing sense of energy and enthusiasm to HP PPS," says Bryan Ma, an IDC analyst in Singapore. Ma says he knew Weisler in his Lenovo days as well as his time at HP covering the Asia-Pacific region."A breath of fresh air" is how former HP executive Charles House describes Weisler. House, co-author of The HP Phenomenon: Innovation and Business Transformation and now executive director at InnovaScapes Institute, says he met Weisler earlier this year at a private training session for HP executives at a Stanford Graduate Business School workshop."He has a keen, wry sense of humor," House says. "He believes in creativity, and actually seems to understand it; he exudes a high ethical standard—something for which [former CEO Mark] Hurd and [former PC chief Todd] Bradley were polar opposites; and he seems self-confident, but not arrogant. He decidedly did not convey a macho attitude—just a quiet-mannered confidence."For IDC's Del Prete, what is most impressive about Weisler is what he has not done. "He's kept the product strategy very focused, developing some products just for specific countries—for example, phones in India," Del Prete says. "This focus is very important as HP thinks about how it evolves in the client space."Weisler's deep understanding of the supply chain will be very useful in his new position—particularly given the PC industry's thin margins, says Bob O'Donnell, founder and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. Indeed, "in terms of knowledge and experience, Weisler will be hard to beat," says Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT.Weisler is already thought to be one of the best PC executives in the industry, Enderle says. "He could have a massive hit if he can get HP’s potentially market-leading, high-speed 3D printer to market."Mobility is another matter. Phones, tablets, perhaps even wearable devices—all are challenges that HP has yet to successfully address. "As we all know, mobility is much more than just devices, and Dion seems to recognize that," Ma says. "But in almost all of my discussions with HP PPS, their response to 'mobility' is still very device-centric. In fact it’s HP’s Enterprise Services team that seems to be in a better position to transform businesses. So, I’m watching to see how HP Inc. will either build or partner with others—including Hewlett-Packard Enterprise—on how to deliver an end-to-end solution rather than just talking about tablets like it does today."But that's part of the job. Weisler's new role "certainly isn't a position for the faint of heart," King says. If he succeeds, "the IT industry will be talking about it for years to come."Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
