May 03, 2011 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BRENTWOOD, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--change:healthcare 
      today announced the addition of Howard McLure as chairman of the board, 
      effective immediately. McLure will also transition to chief executive 
      officer over the next several months, replacing company founder Christopher 
      Parks, who will move to chief development officer to lead continued 
      development of the company’s platform and strategic relationships.
    


      The president of CVS/Caremark Pharmacy Services from 2007 to 2009, where 
      he presided over a $50 billion operation and 15,000 employees, McLure 
      will lead change:healthcare through its next stage of growth as the 
      company continues to gain significant traction with its Cost 
      Transparency Solution.
    

      “I’ve seen healthcare from all sides throughout my career – and I can’t 
      think of a point in our country’s history where there’s been such a 
      critical need to bring cost transparency to the table,” said McLure. 
      “With an already proven track record in the industry, change:healthcare 
      is the only company that’s actually giving healthcare consumers a way to 
      make better decisions about their everyday healthcare purchases – and 
      ultimately helping clients and their employees to reduce healthcare 
      costs.”
    

      For the past 11 years, McLure has been a key driver of the development 
      and expansion of the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) industry. He served 
      eight years in various roles, including CFO, senior executive vice 
      president and COO at Caremark (acquired by MedPartners in 1996) as part 
      of a management team hired to perform a strategic turnaround. As CFO, 
      McLure was instrumental in driving PBM revenue growth from $2.5 million 
      to $37 million in just six years and took a leadership role in the 2004 
      acquisition of AdvancePCS. As COO and senior executive vice president, 
      McLure was a significant player in the merger with CVS in 2007. After 
      the merger, McLure assumed the role of President, Caremark Pharmacy 
      Service, the PBM division of the combined organization. In this role, 
      McLure was also the driver behind the development of creative 
      consumer-facing pharmacy solutions unique to the PBM industry that 
      generated both financial success and value for retailers, employers and 
      consumers.
    

      “We are very excited to have Howard on board; his tenure and success at 
      CVS/Caremark, as well as a shared mission to offer consumers true 
      healthcare cost transparency, made him a perfect fit for our team,” said 
      Parks. “In addition to years of healthcare industry expertise, his 
      impressive history of success with investors, employees and 
      stakeholders, combined with his talent in financial and operational 
      management, will be critical to our aggressive growth plans over the 
      next several years.”
    

      Prior to his career at CVS/Caremark, McLure spent 14 years in senior 
      management roles at Magellan Health Services, an operator of psychiatric 
      hospitals and behavioral management care, where he provided accounting 
      leadership in numerous acquisitions, transactions and divestitures.
    

      McLure is a certified public accountant and member of the American 
      Institute of Public Accountants. He earned a BAA in accounting from the 
      University of Georgia.

			Howard A. McLure was elected to our Board as a director, effective as of March 31, 2011. In addition, as of January 1, 2014, Mr. McLure has been designated as our lead director by the independent directors to preside over executive sessions of non-management directors. From September 2012 until its sale to a third party in November 2014, Mr. McLure served as Executive Chairman of the Board of Change Healthcare Corporation, a provider of healthcare cost transparency services to self-insured employers who sponsor high deductible health care benefit plans. From May 2011 until September 2012, Mr. McLure served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Change Healthcare Corporation. From March 2007 until November 2009, he served as Executive Vice President of CVS Caremark Corporation (NYSE: CVS) and President of Caremark Pharmacy Services, a division of CVS Caremark Corporation, where he was responsible for all sales and operations of the division. From June 2005 until March 2007, Mr. McLure served as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Caremark RX, Inc., listed on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the closing of the CVS Corp. - Caremark RX Inc. merger in March 2007. From May 2000 to June 2005, Mr. McLure served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Caremark RX, Inc. From June 1998 to May 2000, Mr. McLure served as Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer of Caremark RX, Inc. From 1995 to 1998, Mr. McLure was Senior Vice President and Controller of Magellan Health Services, Inc. (now known as Magellan Health, Inc.) (NASDAQ: MGLN), a specialty managed healthcare company. Mr. McLure received his Bachelors of Business Administration in Accounting from the University of Georgia in 1979.
We believe that Mr. McLure's previous experience as Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Change Healthcare Corporation, Executive Vice President of CVS Caremark Corporation and Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Caremark RX, Inc. make him well qualified to serve as a member of our Board.
