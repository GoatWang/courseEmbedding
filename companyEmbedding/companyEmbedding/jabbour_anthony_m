Anthony Jabbour





HomeAbout UsExecutive TeamAnthony Jabbour






Anthony Jabbour
Chief Operating Officer, Banking and Payments
Anthony Jabbour is the chief operating officer of FIS’ Banking and Payments business. Under Jabbour’s leadership, this team has global accountability for solution development, sales and delivery of banking and payments offerings for clients of all sizes and in all geographic markets. Jabbour is keenly focused on driving exceptional growth across all banking and payments product lines on a global basis. 
Since Jabbour joined FIS in 2004, he has held positions of increasing responsibility in operations and delivery services as a key member of the executive leadership team. During his tenure overseeing the North American market, Jabbour consistently grew the segment through a solid combination of organic growth, product expansion, market penetration and strategic acquisitions. 
Prior to joining FIS, Jabbour began his career in IBM’s Global Services group managing complex client projects and relationships. Among the key projects was the launch of a stand-alone Internet bank for CIBC, a major Canadian financial institution. That project led to him joining CIBC, where he relocated to Florida and built similar capabilities for their U.S. market, growing it to more than 350 branches within two years.
Jabbour holds a bachelor’s degree in electric engineering from the University of Toronto.
