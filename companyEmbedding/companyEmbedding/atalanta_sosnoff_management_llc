There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool. Answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from. It doesn't matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion.

Equity Strategy
Large Cap Equity













The Company achieves long term success by employing our consistent adherence to our investment philosophy and process. There are several distinguishing characteristics that set us apart.










Style
Our philosophy of earnings acceleration is a refinement of traditional growth investing. We benefit not only from the earnings growth rate but also from the multiple expansion rewarded to accelerating growth companies.








Sustainability
Over time our investment professionals, with years of experience, have observed patterns of events that are critical to earnings acceleration. These key drivers of growth are identified through our repeatable, three-step process.








Pragmatism
We build portfolios based on our guiding principals of earnings acceleration. Our team generates a high conviction, concentrated portfolio as we believe out performance requires the will to be different from the benchmark.








Culture
All firm resources are dedicated to the earnings acceleration strategy. Our flat organization has been built to provide clients with above average returns and high-touch client service. We align ourselves with our clients through equity ownership and an employee profit sharing plan.










Equity Process










Given our focus on earnings acceleration, our first step in the process is to identify catalysts which will lead to an increase in the growth rate. Each industry possesses unique variables critical to creating earnings acceleration. Typical catalysts include new products, management changes, supply/demand imbalances, and restructuring and regulatory changes. Ideas are sourced through our vast network and through our experience in recognizing fundamental attributes that create accelerated earnings.
Once our thesis of earnings acceleration has been identified, we then conduct security analysis on the stock. We take a task force approach in building out an earnings model. By having all portfolio managers participate in research, we are able to challenge each other and gain perspective. As a result of speaking with company management, customers, suppliers, competitors, and industry experts, we determine the potential impact of the catalyst on earnings.  While we review street expectations, we must gain independent conviction of our thesis before proceeding.








The third step of our process is to apply a valuation discipline to ensure that earnings growth is not yet built into the stock price. Not only do we consider historical valuation levels, we also compare the stock’s valuation to its industry and peer groups. This analysis can provide additional knowledge of upside potential and possible downside risk of each stock. A price target is then set and monitored as earnings and company dynamics evolve. 











Buy/Sell Discipline











In order to capture the benefits of earnings acceleration, we must enter the cycle early. Thus we initiate a probe position of 1%. As our conviction grows, we increase the position to a full weight of 3-5%
Stocks are sold when target prices are met, our thesis for earnings acceleration deteriorates, or to make room in the portfolio for a stock with greater upside potential.
Cash will fluctuate depending on idea generation and sell discipline.

Proxy Voting Policy














Atalanta Sosnoff Capital, LLC (“Atalanta Sosnoff”) exercises voting authority on behalf of substantially all of its discretionary account clients pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreements of Atalanta Sosnoff and Atalanta Sosnoff Management, LLC, its subsidiary to which it provides sub-advisory services.
Atalanta Sosnoff exercises a voice on behalf of its clients and partners of the investment partnerships it manages, in matters of corporate governance through the proxy voting process. Atalanta Sosnoff takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously and believes that the right to vote proxies is a significant asset in its clients’ and partners’ accounts.
In compliance with a recently adopted rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Atalanta Sosnoff has prepared a written statement describing the policies that govern its proxy voting and the procedures by which they are implemented. A copy of these policies and procedures are available upon request. They are also posted on our website at atalantasosnoff.com. Through our proxy voting service, Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”), we maintain records of how we vote the securities held in your account. These records are also available to you upon request.
Atalanta Sosnoff will vote proxies solely in the interests of its clients. Any conflict of interest must be resolved in the way that will most benefit its clients. Since the quality and depth of management is a primary factor considered by us when investing in a company, Atalanta Sosnoff gives substantial weight to the recommendation of management on any issue. However, Atalanta Sosnoff will consider each issue on its own merits, and the position of a company’s management will not be supported in any situation where it is found not to be in the best interests of its clients. Proxy voting will be conducted in accordance with the procedures summarized in this letter.
Atalanta Sosnoff recognizes that under certain circumstances it may have a conflict of interest in voting proxies on behalf of its clients. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, situations where Atalanta Sosnoff or one or more of its affiliates, including officers, directors and employees, has or is seeking a client relationship with the issuer of the security that is the subject of the proxy vote. A conflict of interest will be considered material to the extent that it is determined that such conflict has the potential to influence Atalanta Sosnoff’s decision-making in voting a proxy.
Proxy voting will be managed by a Proxy Director designated by Atalanta Sosnoff. William E. DiPietro, our Senior Vice President of Client Services, is our Proxy Director. Our Proxy Director will assess whether a conflict is material in consultation with senior management and, if he makes such a determination, resolve it by seeking direction from the client or a recommendation from a recognized independent proxy voting agency.
In implementing our policy where we have not expressed a view in our statement we follow the ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines. We favor independent Boards of Directors accountable to the shareholders annually and accounting engagements restricted to audit functions. We believe that equity compensation plans should be minimally dilutive and their beneficiaries should be exposed to market risk. We oppose devices designed to disenfranchise shareholders such as “poison pills”, super-majority provisions or class voting.
Should you have any questions about our voting policies or procedures, if you would like a copy of them or wish to know how we voted your securities, please feel free to contact us.

Business Continuity Plan














Atalanta Sosnoff Management, LLC, together with each of its subsidiaries and affiliates, (“Atalanta Sosnoff” or the “Firm”) are committed to safeguarding the interests of our clients and customers in the event of an emergency or significant business disruption. This Business Continuity Plan Disclosure (the “BCP”) summarizes the Firms’ effort to mitigate risks inherent with unforeseen business interruptions. The Firm’s comprehensive business continuity strategy is designed to enable us to meet our existing obligations to our clients and customers even in the event of an emergency or significant business disruption.
Overview
Atalanta Sosnoff maintains one primary facility to house the backbone of our trading, sales, operations and information technology systems. The data is backed up and stored off site daily. The Firm maintains a backup network in a remote location.
Communication with Our Employees in the Event of a Disruption
The safety and well-being of our employees is a vital concern. In the event of an emergency or significant business disruption, the Firm will communicate with its employees in several different ways. We use a combination of general broadcast and direct targeted outreach. General information such as office closures and operating hours will be posted on the Firm’s internal and external websites and similar recorded updates will play around-the-clock on the Atalanta Sosnoff emergency telephone hotline. Senior managers will be contacted directly via telephone and/or email.
Redundancy of Mission Critical Information Technology Systems
Atalanta Sosnoff has an information technology processing and backup site that, collectively, provide the redundancy required to protect the firm’s books and records, balance sheet and capital, and provide business continuity and client protection. The recovery capability for certain of the Firm’s mission critical processing capabilities is achieved through
the use of a specialized vendor facility that provides disaster recovery services to many large corporations. Unlike
many shared facilities that allocate computer capacity to several different clients on a first-come-first-serve basis, Atalanta Sosnoff owns fully dedicated backup equipment located at the vendor facility. Other mission critical systems are protected by the use of daily backup data stored at a remote location. Recovery times for mission critical systems range between real time recovery and 4 to 12 hours.
Back-Up Trading, Sales and Operations Site
Atalanta Sosnoff does not need to maintain a backup trading floor and operations center because the Firm can
effectively and timely conduct client transactions remotely via telephone, facsimile and alternative technology. In the event that we are unable to enter our building, we will be able to perform necessary procedures remotely.  The functionality of the backup facility is routinely tested by our information technology team.
Protection of Primary Facilities
Protecting the infrastructure of our primary facility is a high priority because it will allow the firm to continue operations in the event of many disaster situations, by permitting our employees on a limited basis to have access to and use of our facility during that situation. Our primary facility has a limited life safety system and infrastructure designed to permit the building to operate despite failures of external power, water, or telecommunications. If the Firm was not afforded access to the building for a prolonged period of time we would utilize the remote back up system and work remotely via internet, telephone and facsimile. The Firm’s backup data center is located in a low-risk area and it has sufficient backup power to operate for a long period of time.
Disclaimer
The Firm’s comprehensive business continuity strategy is designed to enable us to meet our existing obligations to our clients and customers even in the event of an emergency or significant business disruption; however it is not infallible. The plan is designed to work in many different emergency situations; but these events are, by their nature, unpredictable and it is impossible to anticipate every scenario that could cause a business disruption. Furthermore, although we are confident in our own preparedness, Atalanta Sosnoff has no control over the various entities that we must rely upon in the event of an emergency. Our business continuity plans are tested periodically to ensure readiness; yet such tests may not be able to replicate the actual conditions we experience in a real emergency. This BCP is subject to change without notice. In the event that this BCP is modified, the updated document will be promptly posted on the Firms’ internet website. Alternatively, customers may obtain an updated hard copy BCP upon request. The information contained in this disclosure is provided by Atalanta Sosnoff for informational purposes only. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to amend, supplement or otherwise modify any of the terms and conditions set forth in any customer agreement between you and Atalanta Sosnoff.

Market Commentary
June 30, 2017













Our equity results exceeded a robust stock market (S&P 500 +6.1%) in the first quarter and balanced accounts outperformed their benchmarks as well.  Stock selection largely drove excess returns.  The largest contribution came from an Eastern railroad, an investment which illustrates the concept of “seeing things how they could be”.
We purchased the stock in last year’s second half after our research suggested that the company’s traffic drivers, particularly coal volumes, were approaching trough and that operational metrics (train speed, dwell time) promised room for improvement.  Profit margins were at an industry low but we saw a path higher.  Apparently we were not alone as an activist investor took a sizeable stake and is installing a legendary railroad turnaround executive as the CEO.  Holdings in growth stocks such as added significant value in the quarter.
On the flip side, our investment in the energy sector dragged on recent performance.  Domestic inventories of crude oil built during the quarter as U.S. shale output rebounded and there was little apparent impact from OPEC production cuts.  However, a bit of deeper analysis shows that the constructive case remains intact.  The planned timing of OPEC’s and its non-OPEC partners’ production cuts, announced November 30, 2016, varied by country and ranged from weeks to months.  In fact, much of the crude oil imported to the U.S. in the first quarter was ordered before the announcement.  Coupled with seasonally slack winter demand, it was not surprising to see inventories increase.  We expect this quarter to be very different as the full impact of production cuts is seen and we enter a period of strong demand created by the driving season.  The next OPEC meeting will be May 25th, and an extension of the cuts will be on the table.   Logic suggests that the lower levels of output will be extended as inventories will not have reached target by then.  Remember, Saudi Arabia is planning to IPO its production company, Aramco, early in 2018 at what is reported to be a trillion dollar capitalization.  That would seem like a fair amount of incentive to keep oil prices stable to higher.  The Kingdom recently reduced Aramco’s corporate tax rate to 50% from 85% so they seem serious.
Turning to broader financial markets, the yield on the 10 Year Treasury bond has been in a trading range between 2.3% and 2.6% for the last four months.  The “push-pull” here is that rates are below the level where they historically would be given current economic activity/inflation but the incremental data shows no sign of acceleration.  In fact, recent auto sales and other indicators of consumption have been on the softer side.  Furthermore, the likelihood of stimulus from tax reform was significantly diminished after the recent attempt at healthcare legislation revealed schisms within the Republican Party.  However, there are plenty of positive signs.  Housing activity is robust while jobs and wages continue to expand.  Europe has turned the corner as evidenced by the German 10 Year yields going from negative to positive. Soon to be reported first quarter profits should show significant growth boosted by the energy sector rebounding from last year’s losses.
Given conflicting macro currents, we are much more focused on individual companies and select industries than broad sectors (the exception being energy, our largest sector thematic right now.)  Our equity portfolio is pretty well balanced between economically sensitive holdings and classic growth properties.  This past quarter, we took a position in an industrial after research suggested rising orders as demand from the energy and mining segments now appear to approximate replacement levels.  With lean inventories and the company’s strong demonstration of cost control throughout the down cycle, incremental margins could be powerful given any normalization of shipments.  We remain committed to our internet properties while recently increasing our holdings in the international space.  Within the Energy sector we added to EOG Resources, a low-cost/high-unit growth property operating in the Permian Basin.  Although still underweighted the defensive sectors, we recently initiated a probe position in an iconic beverage company on the potential of a new CEO invigorating returns through refranchising bottling operations, improving marketing efficiency and reducing costs.  It’s early but new management situations can be a fertile source of earnings acceleration as far back as we can remember.
With the stock market off to such a quick start this year, there has been much discussion as to whether it is “overvalued”.  We don’t think so.  The chart below shows that the S&P 500’s earnings yield’s (inverse of P/E) spread over corporate bond is roughly at its historic average.  Note the extreme negative level (overvaluation) during the 2009 time period.

Source: Evercore ISI Report date April 6, 2017.
The take here is that stocks are neither particularly cheap nor expensive compared to bonds so valuation is not the critical variable right now.  A more important issue is whether the economy can gain traction after a somewhat slow first quarter.
Looking forward, we are not expecting a smooth ride but this has been an unloved bull market that has fought fears of deflation, Brexit, and the occasional Twitter bomb.  Let’s give it some respect.

There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool. Answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from. It doesn't matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion.
