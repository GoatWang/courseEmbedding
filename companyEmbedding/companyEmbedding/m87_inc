M87 Has a Plan to Make Smartphones the New Small Cells


November 29, 2016



By Diana Goovaerts at Wireless Weekly, November 24thWhat if your smartphone didn’t need to move closer to the tower to get a better connection because it could tap into the stronger signal of a phone nearby? What if it didn’t need a cellular or Wi-Fi connection at all to talk to the devices around it?Turns out both of those hypotheticals will soon be reality, at least, if M87 has anything to say about it.The wireless technology company, led by former T-Mobile executive Cole Brodman, is currently trialing a new solution that would allow devices at the edge of the network to connect and form their own “proximate networks.”Here’s how it works.According to Broadman, the technology – developed by Vidur Bhargava and Dr. Sriram Vishwanath at the University of Texas at Austin – uses software to bridge and route between different radio technologies to allow devices like smartphones to connect with other devices nearby – whether or not they’re connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi or cellular. This in turn allows devices to share information, like location or text messages, with one another and even help each other find the easiest path to the best network connection.Brodman said the technology is “more or less” radio agnostic, multi-operating system (iOS and Android), multi-RF, and multi-hop (to allow single or multiple hops between devices trying to reach the network).Read the full article at Wireless Week.

Qualcomm, Madrona, Trilogy invest $5M in mobile networking startup M87; T-Mobile vet Cole Brodman named CEO


November 29, 2016



BY TAYLOR SOPER of Geekwire on November 17, 2016 at 6:00 amThe former T-Mobile executive, who spent 17 years at the wireless carrier and held positions as CMO and CTO, is now CEO of M87, a mobile networking startup that today announced a $5 million fundraising round led by Madrona Venture Group, with participation from Qualcomm Ventures and Trilogy Equity Partners.Brodman left T-Mobile in 2012 and spent the next four years as a board member for a handful of startups. One of those companies was M87, which launched out of Austin, Texas in 2014.M87’s technology, born out of research done by founder Vidur Bhargava and Dr. Sriram Vishwanath at the University of Texas in Austin, helps wireless carriers improve network performance by creating dynamic device-to-device mesh networks. As Brodman spent more and more time advising the company, it eventually asked him to take on a leadership role.Read the full article at Geekwire.

The Wi-Fi Alliance - on M87 and Wi-Fi Innovations


September 15, 2014



From a keynote address by Kevin Fitchard:Last month Gigaom ran a big feature series called ‘Reinventing the internet’, exploring how broadband technology, applications policy, and security were evolving – and should evolve – to connect the world in the 21st century.I handled the wireless component of that series, and I slightly surprised myself by writing as much about unlicensed technologies like Wi-Fi as I wrote about traditional cellular networks.Here were my conclusions: The mobile internet of the future isn’t going to be supplied by a single carrier, using a single wireless technology, on a single service plan. If we truly want to use mobile broadband the way we use fixed broadband, then our wireless signals will come from multiple sources, and one of those key sources will be Wi-Fi.My colleague Stacey Higginbotham took that idea one step further when she wrote this headline last August “Who’s your new mobile carrier? How about Wi-Fi?”Her argument was that Wi-Fi has become so key to connecting our mobile devices, that selecting the Wi-Fi networks available to you is far more important than what mobile carrier you choose. As an example, Republic Wireless, a mobile virtual network operator with a Wi-Fi First focus, was seeing 90 percent of its mobile traffic traverse Wi-Fi networks.Of course, Republic is a small MVNO with a customer base committed to this kind of data offload model. If you talk to a more a traditional carrier, they’ll tell you this kind of model will never work for most people. Mobile networks use dedicated spectrum. Mobile networks are planned and managed.Relying on Wi-Fi as your primary mobile internet connection would be inviting chaos. And they’re right. Wi-Fi is chaotic. As anyone who has ever been to big industry conference, where every exhibitor sets up their own network, knows this. The competition for the unlicensed bands’ limited capacity is fierce. Everyone has experienced connecting to a dead or overloaded hotspot and having to force your phone off the network. But anyone who has ever tried to connect to a 4G network during rush hour in downtown Chicago has experienced similar problems.Yes, Wi-Fi can be chaos, but I would argue that it’s a beautiful chaos. Many of the most popular mobile applications we have today got their start and maintained their popularity because of Wi-Fi. If you ever streamed an HD movie to your tablet on Netflix, then you probably did it over Wi-Fi.Wi-Fi hasn’t just been a source of tremendous capacity but also an incredible driver on innovation. Unlike cellular spectrum which is licensed and tightly controlled by the operators, the openness of the unlicensed bands allows anyone with a new idea to go for broke.At Gigaom we write a lot about startups, and increasingly the networking startups I talk to are making Wi-Fi the centerpiece of their businesses. Open Garden is using Wi-Fi Direct and Bluetooth to build ad hoc messaging networks that bypass the internet entirely. M87 is trying to help carriers build faster and more resilient cellular networks by letting phones crowdsource their connections via Wi-Fi.- See more at: http://www.wi-fi.org/beacon/kevin-fitchard/wi-fi-a-beautiful-chaos-part-2#sthash.QN9nXAil.dpuf

GigaOm on recent M87 developments


May 28, 2014



"Qualcomm is a big proponent of a new mobile standard called LTE Direct, which uses LTE radios to connect two nearby devices directly rather than use the mobile network as intermediary. If Qualcomm were to combine its own LTE Direct efforts with M87’s crowdsourced connectivity technology it could create extremely dense and constantly morphing LTE networks that penetrate into the furthest recesses of buildings and other hard-to-reach areas."  Read more.

ONE THING THAT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE, IS THAT YOU DO NOT USE THE BELOW AMMUNITION TO KILL ! YOU USE THE BELOW AMMUNITION, TO STOP A LIFE THREATENING ATTACK AGAINST YOU, WHEN YOU HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE ! IF THE ATTACKER DIES, THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKER'S DEATH RESTS ONLY, WITH THE ATTACKER !
Using  finely manufactured Self Defense Ammunition, is of critical importance when using your Concealed Carry Handgun   in a Combat Situation. If you use cheap practice ammunition in combat, it could easily cost you, your life ! 

When you go to a pistol range, and practice with your conceal carry handgun, you can use much less expensive ammunition, that is called practice ammunition. This ammunition  can be either factory ammunition, or reloaded ammunition. The average distance in a gun fight is from 3 feet to 21 feet. Because these distances seldom are beyond 21 feet, the ballistics of cheap practice ammunition is so close to expensive finely manufactured combat ammunition ,that the difference, or where the bullet strikes the target, can be measured in  one inch, or less at 21 feet distance to the target. In a gun fight that would come down to cheap ammunition striking the left ventricle of the target's heart, and expensive finely manufactured combat ammunition, striking an inch away in the  right ventricle of the target's heart. It really will not make much difference. So use cheap factory ammunition when you are firing live rounds at a paper target on a live fire pistol range, but not in a gun fight.
HOW TO TEST, THE FINELY MANUFACTURED COMBAT AMMUNITION YOU HAVE CHOOSEN:
To know exactly how the finely manufactured combat ammunition you have chosen works  with, and feeds in your semi-automatic Concealed Carry Pistol. Do the following: fire three COMBAT ROUNDS in quick sussession at a paper target at the live fire pistol range. If any of the three finely manufactured combat ammunition rounds has ANY PROBLEMS FEEDING into your semi-automatic Concealed Carry Pistol, THEN GET RID OF THAT SPECIFIC COMBAT AMMUNITION, AND NEVER, EVER USE THAT COMBAT AMMUNITION IN THAT SPECIFIC SEMI-AUTO CONCEALED CARRY PISTOL AGAIN!  YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE YOUR CONCEALED CARRY PISTOL HAVE ANY MALFUNCTOION WHATSOEVER, DURING A GUN BATTLE. CHOSE ANOTHER FINELY MANUFACTURED COMBAT AMMUNITION THAT WILL PASS THE ABOVE TEST !
So what is the difference between cheap practice ammunition, and finely manufactured combat ammunition? The difference is in the quality of the cartridge case, the quality of the primer, the quality of the powder in the cartridge, and the care and preciseness used to manufacture each cartridge. But the most important part in combat ammunition is the type, and combat quality of the bullet. Lastly, finely manufactured combat ammunition is much, much less likely to fail to function properly in the middle of a gun battle !
A WISE SUGGESTION ON CHOOSING WHICH EXACT FINELY MANUFACTURED COMBAT AMMUNITION TO USE IN YOU CONCEALED CARRY PISTOL:
After you have survived, and won the gun battle with the bad guy, how would you like to either spend years in prison, or have all your property taken from you in a civil law suit ?
Whatever finely manufactured combat ammunition you use in your Concealed Carry Pistol, the jury will be told that your ammunition was exploding dum dum killer bullets by the attorney that is trying to nail you to the cross. To solve this problem, just call your local police department, and ask a command officer in charge, what manufacturer, brand, caliber, bullet weight and bullet type that that specific police department mandates that their police officers use when on duty. Thereby, you can answer that attorney trying to crucify you, with the answer that you used the exact same finely manufactured combat ammunition that your local police department, or sheriff's office has chosen to use for their own police officers to use when they are on duty, in your concealed carry pistol. Thereby you are using the exact same ammunition that has been humanely chosen for pruposes of not just killing a person outright, but defending yourself from lethal attacks by a criminal (THE JURY WILL UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMMUNITION YOU USED, SHOWS THAT YOU ARE NOT A MAD DOG KILLER, BUT THAT YOU CHOISE THE MOST HUMANE AMMUNITION POSSIBLE, AND THEY SHOULD ACCEPT THIS).
Let's start off by showing you what a bad combat bullet looks like:

Why are the above bullets bad? Because they all are solid bullets, which means that if they are fired at a target, there is a high degree of probability that the bullet would go completely through the target, and then AFTER EXITING THE TARGET MAY STILL HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY & FORCE, THAT THE BAD BULLET COULD THEN STRIKE, AND SERIOUSLY INJURE OR KILL AN INNOCENT PERSON ! Bad bullets have been known to simply wound the bad guy, because the bad bullet does not open up in the bad guy, thus causing little damage to the bad guy. Many real life combat situations have been, that after the bad bullet leaves the bad guy, the bad bullet goes right through a wall, and wounds or kills an innocent person. That innocent person could be a loved one. So using bad combat bullets in a gun fight is a pretty sure way of causing great bodily harm, to some innocent person in the vicinity of the gun fight. DO NOT USE THIS BAD BULLET TYPE OF AMMUNITION, WHEN YOU ARE CARRYING YOUR CONCEALED PISTOL FOR SELF  DEFENSE PURPOSES !
The perfect combat bullet never leaves the target, so thereby, the perfect combat bullet would then only cause injury to the target. We all know that nothing in this world is perfect, so the combat bullets I will be talking to you about, are all imperfect combat bullets.
Bullet placement on the target, is everything in combat. If you shoot a target in the hand with the best combat  ammunition in the world, that bullet has a 99.9% chance of exiting the target with enough energy, to seriously injure, or kill an innocent person. So using the best combat ammunition,  does not totally eliminate the chance of injuring an innocent person, IF YOU PUT THAT GOOD COMBAT BULLET IN THE WRONG PLACE, ON THE BAD GUY !
THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO  USING BAD BULLETS IN COMBAT:
	        Is there ever a situation where a specific bad combat bullet would be good to use in a combat situation? The answer is yes. If you had a gun fight where the bad guy took cover behind a wooden wall, then a solid bullet would be able to completely penetrate the wooden wall, and still retain enough energy to kill, or cause great bodily harm to the bad guy. So what does that mean to you? It means that you could carry one magazine with good combat bullets that is loaded into your concealed carry handgun, and then have a second magazine with you that contains solid bullets, that can easily penetrate walls. Do most gun fights take place where one or more combatants are behind wooden walls, or behind cover of some sort, the answer is - normally that is not what happens in most gun fights. Yet it is a possibility that you can not ignore.
Do not be cheap, when it comes to buying combat ammunition for when you are actually carrying your concealed carry handgun. Why? Because, if that ammunition fails to perform as expected, it could cost you, your life !
What does a good combat bullet look like? 
The answer is that  good combat bullets come in two ways:
The 1st way is that they are made of a substance that allows the good bullet to come apart in the target. These bullets are called "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLETS" most of these bullets have a hollow point.
The 2nd way, is that these good combat bullets have what appears to be solid points such as the  "GLAZER SAFETY SLUG" shown below: (We will first talk about the Glazer Safety Slug.)
 
Glazer Safety Slugs were first manufactured by Corbon in 1974, for the use by U.S. Air Marshals in airplanes in flight, in that a Glazer Safety Slug would not penetrate the skin of an airplane, and thus not cause explosive decompression in the passenger cabin, which could easily lead to catastrophic failure in flight of the airplane's exterior skin structure.
What you might notice when you look at the above picture of a Glazer Safety Slug, is that inside the bullet case are BBs. When the Glazer Safety Slug enters a human target, the blue plastic ball in the front of the bullet comes out of the bullet, the exterior skin of the bullet easily peals back and releases all the BBs inside the target, thus causing a massive wound cavity,  massive pain to the target, and a very low probability of any of the Glazer Safety Slug material exiting the target, and hurting an innocent person. All the above happens if the Glazer Safety Slug is placed in the center mass, or chest area of the target.
You will notice that the color of the plastic ball at the point of the above shown Glazer Safety Slug is colored"BLUE". Glazer Safety Slugs are manufactured in two manners for use under two separate conditions. 
Glazer Safety Slug Condition #1:
	        During the late spring, summer, and early fall when people wear light clothing, the Glazer Safety Slug with the "BLUE" colored ball, will be able to penetrate that light clothing, and expand correctly within the target, and perform as described above.
Glazer Safety Slug Condition #2:
	        During the late fall, winter, and early spring when people wear heavy clothing, the Glazer Safety Slug with the "BLUE" colored ball, could when entering that heavy clothing easily explode on the surface of that heavy clothing, and thus cause little if any damage to the target. But, if you used a  Glazer Safety Slug with the "SILVER" colored ball, then that bullet will first penetrate the target's outer heavy clothing, and then upon entering the target's skin expand correctly within the target, and perform as described above.
So, if you are going to use a Glazer Safety Slug as your combat pistol ammunition, you have to change that ammunition from the BLUE color, to the SILVER color when it gets cold, and people start wearing heavy clothing.
If you can not find Glazer Safety Slugs in your area stores, then you could purchase it directly from Corbon. Click here for the Corbon web site.

WE WILL NOW TALK ABOUT "TARGET RANGE FRANGIBLE BULLETS" :
Frangible Bullets initially came about to solve the problem that takes place at a target range. When a lead bullet is fired from a handgun at a pistol range,  a small amount of the lead of that bullet is turned into  powdered lead, and also when the lead bullet strikes the backstop of the pistol range, another larger amount of lead is turned into a powder. This powdered lead can be breathed in by the shooters in the target range, as well as, could be breathed in by people in their homes, and back yards of the immediate area that surrounds the target range. Lead is a substance that can, and does cause a large amount of negative medical conditions in people's health.
So owners of target ranges to eliminate the possibility of causing problems to the health of their customers, as well as, the health of their neighbors, came up with a bullet that is not made of lead, and literally explodes on contact with the target range's backstop.
These bullets are called for our discussion "TARGET RANGE FRANGIBLE BULLETS". Many FRANGIBLE BULLETS are manufactured for target range purposes only, and are not manufactured for combat purposes. An easy way to tell the difference, is that "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLETS" are usually, but not always hollow point bullets.
The series of high speed pictures shown below shows a "TARGET RANGE FRANGIBLE BULLET" when it strikes a solid wall. The 1st picture shows the bullet as it strikes the wall. The 2nd picture shows  the bullet as it starts to come apart, and sprays the wall with particles of the bullet. The 3rd and 4th pictures show the "TARGET RANGE FRANGIBLE BULLET" as it completely comes apart and sprays the wall with nearly all the material of the bullet. Most important, is the picture does not show  any part of the "TARGET RANGE FRANGIBLE BULLET" turning into a dust, thus nearly eliminating the need for expensive air filters to remove health damaging lead dust from the air.

Now let us talk about "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLETS":
A "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLET" is made to come apart inside the target, an example would be the below two gel block pictures.

If you look at the first picture, you will see many small pieces of the  bullet shoot off from the main part of the bullet upon entry into the gel block. Each of these small pieces stays inside the gel block, and the remaining larger portion of the bullet (shown on the right of the picture) does not exit the gel block, but  stays completely inside the gel block. Thus 100% of this "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLET" would normally stay inside the target. This first "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLET" is penetrating further into the gel block than the second example shown below. 

The second gel block test of a "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLET" that appears above, shows the bullet coming apart within the target much quicker than the 1st gel block test picture shown above. But, both of the "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLETS" shown above, stay completely within the gel block, and would be more reliable not to exit the target, and injure an innocent person in the area of a gun fight.
"COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLETS" can look like the below pictures, but one fairly common shared thing about these "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLETS" is that they are hollow point bullets.

What a "COMBAT FRANGIBLE BULLET" normally looks like after penetrating a target is shown below:

What is important about the above pictures, is that these bullets have almost doubled in diameter. Which means the target will sustain more tissue damage, more pain, and more bleeding due to the razor sharp edges of these bullets, which will significantly reduce the target's  ability, or the target's determination to continue the gunfight. The doubling of the diameter of the bullet, also allows the bullet to transfer more of it's energy to the target. Thus reducing significantly the chance of the bullet having enough energy to exit the target, and injure or kill an innocent person in the area of the gun fight.

There is some talk within the conceal carry community about "LEO" ammunition, which is "Law Enforcement Only" ammunition. There was a time 10 to 20 years ago, that you as a civilian, could not purchase "LEO" ammunition, but that is not the case today. One of many examples  today is, Speer's Gold Dot ammunition that when sold in a box labeled "LEO" ammunition contains 50 rounds per box, but the exact same Speer Gold Dot ammunition is sold to civilians, and is not marked "LEO" ammunition, and is sold 20 rounds per box.
NEVER PURCHASE ANY AMMUNITION IF IT IS "TRACER", OR "INCENDIARY" AMMUNITION, BECAUSE IT COULD MAKE YOUR PISTOL EXPLODE IN YOUR HAND, WHEN YOU FIRE IT.
BELOW IS A WHOLE NEW BULLET TECHNOLOGY "ARX BULLET":
POLYCASE HAS  DEVELOPED AN EFFECTIVE YET SOFT-SHOOTING ARX BULLET. 
 
ARX INCEPTOR VIDEO
SLOW MOTION VIDEO OF ARX BULLET SEEN TUMBLING IN GELATIN TARGET
The 77-grain  bullet in PolyCase's Inceptor load makes for a  soft-shoot round that still performs like a .38 Special is supposed to. 

Notes: All bullets weigh 77 grains. Accuracy results are averages of five  five-shot groups at 25 yards on a Champion rest. Velocities are averages of 10  shots recorded with a LabRadar, set to record 15 feet  from the muzzle.
POLYCASE'S NEWEST OFFERING IS A .38 Special featuring the company's ARX bullet, which has an inter­esting 77-grain weight. The  listed velocity is 1,116 fps, which is at first glance pretty enthusiastic, but  keep that weight in mind.
The ARX bullet does  not expand. The three flutes in the bullet profile are the aspects of the  bullet that do the work of creating a wound channel. The mathematics of fluid  dynamics are beyond our scope, but testing indicates that they work. The  rotating bullet drives into the target, and flutes attempt to push aside the  tissue it travels through. The shape of the flutes works to accelerate the  tissue as it is pushed, and this creates the wound channel and decelerates the  bullet, and we can tell the ARX is working by its  lack of penetration—the opposite of how we usually judge a bullet.
 The ARX bullet does  not penetrate as deeply, in any loading, as a similar full metal jacket or lead  roundnose does. Typical penetration of a .38 Special  158-grain lead roundnose is on the order of 24  inches, and I tested the PolyCase .38 Special load in  four different double-action revolvers that are suitable home defense or carry  guns: a two-inch Smith & Wes­son Model 15, one of my favorites; a  three-inch Smith & Wesson Model 65; a four-inch Smith & Wesson Model  19, which I shoot in IDPA; and a six-inch Smith &  Wesson Model 19. Those last two were classic police duty guns for many decades.
 I figured with four different barrel lengths I'd get a good read  on the PolyCase's performance. The .38 Spe­cial ARX penetrated just a bit under or over 12 inches in  ballistic gelatin, regardless of the velocity or barrel length. For those who  worship at the altar of the FBI tests, this indicates marginal or failed  performance, but no other .38 Special load is going to pass. And despite its  detractors, the .38 Special is not ineffective.
 Another interesting aspect was an additional quick test I did with  the six-inch Model 19. I placed a 3/4-inch marine plywood barrier in front of a  gel block and recovered a bullet that had traveled not quite an inch less than  out of the same gun into a block without a barrier.
 In talking with the PolyCase  engi­neers at an industry function, they were  not at all surprised. "The ARX acts like a  jacketed roundnose on a barrier, but the flutes still  work in tissue behind the barrier," a company rep told me. And unlike a  hollow-point, the flutes of the ARX can't get plugged  with barrier material.
The lighter ARX, combined with its high velocities, would lead you to  expect a radical change in point of impact. Super-speed lightweight bul­lets  can print to a different location on the target than traditional bullet  weights. ARX accuracy was as good as any other ammo  I've tested out of those guns, and the point of impact let weights.
And the  ARX's light bullet also translates to less recoil,  making it more attractive to new shooters or the recoil sensitive. A 77-grain  bullet at 1,100 fps has a Power Factor of only 85, which is mild in anybody's  book. The impression of recoil I got with the Model 15 was in between a .32 ACP and a .380 Auto—and yet it deliv­ers into gelatin like  a .38 Special.
The  powdered metal in the poly­mer construction of the bullet means it  enthusiastically fragments on a steel plate, breaking up to the point of almost  turning into powder. You can shoot steel plates closer with ARX  (still, you need to wear glasses) than you can with any other bullet.
The customary safety distance with regular  bullets is 10 yards. As long as the steel is smooth—not dented or cratered—you could safely  get closer than 10 yards with ARX. So a new shooter receives soft recoil, hits con­sistently  because of the close range, and gets the immediate feedback of banging a steel  plate or knocking over the falling plates. That's the way to build confidence  and allow the new shooter to have fun.
And they could be doing this with a compact,  light revolver, eminently suitable for home defense or concealed carry. (One  other note: The ARX ammo feeds easily into a  revolver's cylinders. The flutes don't catch on the chamber edges; the rounds  drop right in.) All this sounds like a good prescription for someone in need of  a defensive tool—a person who might not otherwise consider arming themselves  because they think a gun has to be big and loud. PolyCase  gives them an effective option without a lot of noise and PolyCase is aggressively expanding the  line, and it won't be long before it has something for pretty much any handgun  you own including semi-auto calibers. But right now, a whole lot of .38 Special  owners find themselves with an attractive new op­tion priced similar to most  defensive ammo. 

Features:

		      REVOLUTIONARY       DEFENSE         TECHNOLOGY: From the research and    development 
		      laboratory of PolyCase Ammunition®,  the Inceptor®  ARX®  is the next-generation of defense 
		      ammunition.  Through advanced   design and materials science the ARX®  uses fluid 
		      dynamics and non-expanding   surface area instead of expansion to achieve terminal 
	        performance. 
ENGINEERED       FLUID DYNAMICS:   By design, the   enhanced surface area and design of the 
		      ARX® exploit the  bullet's forward energy and redirect that energy in the form of hydraulic 
		      displacement (hydrostatic shock). This hydraulic displacement creates a wound cavity that 
		      rivals that created by expanding bullets. 
LATERAL   FORCE:   The ARX®  bullet's hydraulic displacement effect is achieved by the 
		      ARX®  technology. The  ARX®  flutes — grooves on the nose of the bullet — have wide mouths 
		      and narrow exit points.  hen  combined with the bullet's forward velocity into soft tissue, the 
		      design of the ARX®  flutes causes an increase in pressure of the fluid. As a result, the fluid 
		      is laterally ejected from the flutes at a higher velocity than the actual speed of the bullet 
		      itself, creating the massive cavitation and wound channels seen in the ARX® gelatin tests. 
SPECIALLY    ENGINEERED     PROFILE:    Because it has no hollow-point or sharp edges on 
		      the nose of the bullet, the ARX® feeds like a round nose, yet retains stopping power and 
		      terminal performance that exceeds   many expanding   handgun bullets. 
PRECISE:  Injection molded    ARX® projectiles deliver exceptional accuracy. 
HIGH    VELOCITY: Achieves  higher velocity and higher energy than many other defense 
		      cartridges, yet imparts less recoil for quicker follow up shots. 
ADVANCED     MATERIALS:    Performs  in a wide range of conditions and  weapons systems, 
		      including suppressed.
