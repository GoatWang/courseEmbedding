    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Union Square Ventures Is Raising A New $200 Million Opportunity Fund

Next Story

Hey, Look, Asus EEE Pad Teaser Pics












Update 1/15/11: Union Square ended up raising $165 million for this fund.  More info here.
Union Square Ventures is raising $200 million for a new fund called the Union Square Ventures Opportunity Fund LP. According to an SEC filing, the VC firm already raised $135 million for the fund from 19 investors.  The last time Union Square raised money was for its $156 million Union Square Ventures 2008 LP fund.
Union Square Ventures is the leading early stage VC firm in New York City led by Fred Wilson, Brad Burnham, and Albert Wenger.  The filing also lists a new partner, John Buttrick.  Its portfolio includes Twitter, Foursquare, Zynga, Tumblr, Boxee, Disqus, Etsy, Clickable, and Indeed.
Partner Fred Wilson is well known for betting on startups right out of the gate before most other VCs will touch them, and is also highly-visible because of his popular blog, A VC.  He recently raised concerns about too many venture investors chasing returns, wanting to invest in venture startups without really understanding their business.  But in that same post he also wrote:
The venture capital business is showing good returns for the first time in a decade. The sectors that are performing best are web services and early stage/seed investing. These are sectors we have been investing in for over fifteen years. We’ve seen these sectors boom and bust before and we’ll probably see it again. We are committed to these sectors and have no plans to leave them.
Union Square’s new Opportunity Fund will presumably focus on the same sorts of early stage Internet startups Union Square is so good at sniffing out.  Although the name is different its previous funds, which are differentiated by date.  So it is possible that the Opportunity fund will focus on a different set of opportunities.  I have an email out to Union Square about this and will update when I hear back.
Update: Fred Wilson says: “We cannot comment at this time because we’re still in the process of raising the fund.  We look forward to giving you a full report when that process concludes, which is expected later in January”

Firm[edit]
Union Square Ventures was founded in 2003 by Fred Wilson (a former partner of Flatiron Partners) and Brad Burnham (a former Executor in Residence with AT&T Ventures). The two men created USV with the intent of investing in and fostering the development of early-stage companies.[9] Their investments are “mostly U.S.-based Internet and mobile companies considered to be ‘disruptive’”.[10]
In 2007, Albert Wenger, the former president of del.icio.us, joined the firm as a partner. The team was rounded out by the subsequent additions of John Buttrick and Betaworks founder Andy Weissman.
USV is one of a handful of firms that regularly included in Red Herring’s lists of top venture capital firms.[11]
In 2011, USV was deemed as being the best performing VC in the US based on investment return rate.[12]

Firm[edit]
Union Square Ventures was founded in 2003 by Fred Wilson (a former partner of Flatiron Partners) and Brad Burnham (a former Executor in Residence with AT&T Ventures). The two men created USV with the intent of investing in and fostering the development of early-stage companies.[9] Their investments are “mostly U.S.-based Internet and mobile companies considered to be ‘disruptive’”.[10]
In 2007, Albert Wenger, the former president of del.icio.us, joined the firm as a partner. The team was rounded out by the subsequent additions of John Buttrick and Betaworks founder Andy Weissman.
USV is one of a handful of firms that regularly included in Red Herring’s lists of top venture capital firms.[11]
In 2011, USV was deemed as being the best performing VC in the US based on investment return rate.[12]

Firm[edit]
Union Square Ventures was founded in 2003 by Fred Wilson (a former partner of Flatiron Partners) and Brad Burnham (a former Executor in Residence with AT&T Ventures). The two men created USV with the intent of investing in and fostering the development of early-stage companies.[9] Their investments are “mostly U.S.-based Internet and mobile companies considered to be ‘disruptive’”.[10]
In 2007, Albert Wenger, the former president of del.icio.us, joined the firm as a partner. The team was rounded out by the subsequent additions of John Buttrick and Betaworks founder Andy Weissman.
USV is one of a handful of firms that regularly included in Red Herring’s lists of top venture capital firms.[11]
In 2011, USV was deemed as being the best performing VC in the US based on investment return rate.[12]

Union Square Closing in on $200M New Fund

 writes: 



















Early stage venture capital firm Union Square Ventures has closed on about $135 million of a new fund, Union Square Ventures Opportunity Fund LP, which could end up with as much as $200 million, according to an S.E.C. filing.
According to the filing, Union Square is also adding John Buttrick as a partner on the fund. The addition of Buttrick, a lawyer and former partner with private equity firm LiveWire Ventures, has fueled speculation that Union Square’s new fund will focus on later-stage companies. 
Details of the filing were first reported by Fortune, which cited a source confirming the fund would focus on later-stage investments.
As far as Union Square Ventures goes, Principal Fred Wilson has commented on the filing, without actually commenting on fund:

“There are ways to keep a financing quiet and avoid these filings and we have been involved in financings where that was done successfully. But unless you specifically request that your lawyers keep the financing quiet, you are most likely going to have your fundraising effort in the public record. 
“And this can catch you off guard. If you want to control the message and announce the financing to your employees first so they don’t read about it in the tech blogs, you need to be aware that the clock is ticking and you need to get the word out fairly promptly.”
Wilson said on his blog that “due to legal issues” he “can’t comment on it until next month sometime.”
New York-based Union Square raised its debut fund of $125 million in 2004, and is known for its early bets on Internet companies such as Twitter and Zynga. Its second fund, Union Square Ventures 2008 LP, closed four years later with $156 million. 
The firm’s exits include Tacoda, which sold to AOL in 2007 for about $300 million; Feedburner, acquired by Google in 2007 for a reported $100 million; and Del.icio.us, sold to Yahoo in 2005 for roughly $30 million.

We're hiring
Sep 28, 2011

“

Union Square Ventures has a long history - in internet time at least - of hiring off this blog (posts here, here, and here.) A fundamental assumption of the way we've hired is that we're able to get to know great people through their "web presence" - the trail of online communities, projects, and services with which they've engaged. Just as we invest in the transformative power of the internet, we're also looking to build our organization off the internet - plus, we've met some really impressive folks through this blog. And so, in this vein, I'm excited to announce that USV is hiring an investment analyst.The analyst position at Union Square Ventures is a two-year role designed for someone who doesn't have an MBA. As an analyst at USV, you'll learn what the venture capital business is about, and you'll get insight into a handful of fascinating startups too. We hope that, after working with us, this person will move on to a startup or another venture firm or pursue an advanced degree.The primary responsibility of the analyst is to help manage the day-to-day activities of the firm, including: 

Meeting with entrepreneurs who have started businesses in which USV may be interested in investing
Performing market research and due diligence for potential investments, which could entail financial or web-analytics modeling, interviewing customers/users or potential customers/users, or testing products and services
Reporting for our investors, which includes helping to set companies' valuations, writing quarterly updates, and packaging the material for our LPs
Working with USV portfolio companies, including helping out with hiring, events-planning, and research and attending board meetings
Designing and executing projects of your own direction that help USV and/or our portfolio companies
We're looking for someone who demonstrates:

Deep understanding of the ecosystem of web and mobile services
Strong written and oral communication skills - well-defended opinions are a necessity
Familiarity with web technologies - you know the difference between the LAMP stack and a stack of lamps
Strong interpersonal skills - you'll often be talking to entrepreneurs and other investors on behalf of USV
Comfort modeling in Excel
Ideally, prior design or programming experience or work in an investment or internet-related position
Our office is in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, and the job starts immediately. We're a small team, and we'll be looking for someone who fits our culture. Culture's a tricky thing to describe well, so we encourage you to check out our web presences.If you're interested in the position, please reach out:First, we're looking to see links that will help us get to know you. This could be anything from a Twitter account to a blog or Tumblr to a project you hacked together - whatever represents you best. We expect your web presence to represent who you are, not who you think an employer wishes you were, so please don't waste time sanitizing your web presence before sending us there. We get it.Second, we'd also like to hear from you, so we're asking each applicant to record two short videos answering these questions: "Why are you interested in the analyst role at Union Square Ventures?" (up to a 90-second response) and "Which web or mobile services most inspire you?" (up to a 120-second response) We're using Take The Interview to collect the video responses securely.To apply, visit Take The Interview. None of the information you submit will be shared outside of USV. We'll be accepting applicants until 6pm Eastern time on Thursday, October 13.If you have questions, please leave them in the comments below. Otherwise, we're looking forward to hearing about what you find compelling, what you've made, how you think, and why you're into what we do.

A Google search for “apartment lease” returns 86 million results. Which makes sense. One of the constants in life is finding a place to live, and signing a long-term contract for that living place. That constant — that lease — remains in force even though changes in our lives may not line up neatly with that one- or two-year period. Many things happen to us while we are stuck with a long-term house or apartment lease: new job opportunities, new roommates or relationships, new family members, and so much more.

Quizlet
Nov 23, 2015

“
There are some investments that take years to make. They are often our best investments. Quizlet took something like five years to go from a company we got interested in to a USV investment.
In March 2009, we hosted an event we called Hacking Education. That was the official start of our focus on education. From that event came a thesis on how we would approach investing in education. We would invest in lightweight services and networks that allowed anyone to learn anything. We would not invest in services sold top down to the existing K-12 and higher education system. We wanted to obliterate, not automate.
We started hunting around for services and networks that fit our thesis. One that caught our attention was Quizlet, the leading web and mobile studying tool. We got an intro through Christina. Eventually Andy got a meeting. We found out that Quizlet had been bootstrapped, was profitable, and was not interested in raising outside capital. But Andy did not take no for an answer. He kept calling on them. He brought me to meet the two Quizlet leaders, Andrew and Dave, in September 2012. We got the same story in that meeting but we did make an impression. We started inviting them to our events in SF and they usually would come. So we kept doing that and kept stoping by to say hi when we were in SF.
Earlier this year Dave called me to say that they were going to raise outside capital. He and Andrew had concluded that the opportunity to build and develop peer to peer learning and studying tools for web and mobile was so large that they could not continue to bootstrap. So we jumped onto the opportunity and threw ourselves at it. That process had a number of fits and starts but we hung in there and eventually the financing came together the way Andrew and Dave wanted it to and we joined our friends at Costanoa, Altos, and Owl in a $12mm Series A round for a ten year old company. Just writing those last few words makes me happy. You don't see many Series A rounds for ten year old companies. But when you do, they are generally good ones to do.
So what is Quizlet? Well if you have kids in middle, high school, or college, they probably use it. Quizlet is a studying/learning tool written by Andrew Sutherland for his own use ten years ago when he was studying for a french test. He put it out on the web a bit later. He was joined by Dave Margulius who helped him turn Quizlet into a business by implementing an elegant freemium business model. Quizlet is free for anyone to use. But if you want to do certain higher value things, you can pay a small amount every month for access to them.
Quizlet lets anyone create a study set and practice it online and on mobile. And it also allows anyone to use someone else's study set. Quizlet is peer to peer learning. Over 100mm study sets have been created by users and over 1bn study sessions have been done on Quizlet. Quizlet has been a top ten education app in the mobile app stores for years, a fact I was constantly reminded of every time I went to look at the education category in the years we were chasing this investment.
Here are some examples I just found by searching around:

a sine/cosine study set
35 essential french verbs
aerobic and anaerobic respiration
forklift test prep

Just imagine a massively open database of 100mm study sets like that which is growing by the day. And you get why we have been and continue to be so interested in Quizlet.
There are over 7bn learners on planet earth. Within a decade, the vast majority of them will have a mobile device connected to this massively open database of study set which is available for free. These 7bn learners will be able to contribute and consume these study sets. And in the process the world will become more educated and more literate. That is hacking education and that is why USV is so excited to, finally, be an investor in Quizlet.

New Fund - Same Focus
Mar 05, 2008

“

We closed on Union Square Ventures 2008 LP last week.  Our new fund, at $156mm in capital ments, is large enough for us to be able to act on our conviction and to support our portfolio, but small enough to enable us to flexibly build positions in attractive, capital efficient, Web services.The investment focus of Union Square Ventures 2008 LP remains the same. We are convinced that the information technology enabled transformation of the global economy has only begun. The environment, however, is quite different today than it was when we closed our first fund four years ago. Then, the economy was just emerging from the collapse of the dot com bubble, and the opportunity for Web services like del.icio.us and Feedburner was not yet broadly understood. Today, the global economy seems to be headed into a recession and the market for lightweight Web services is arguably over populated and over invested. So even though we have not changed where we invest, we continue to evolve how we invest to adapt to the changing market. Today, new Web services are popping up every day. Unfortunately, users only have so much time. Services targeted at Web savvy early adopters, will increasingly need to displace time spent with existing services to gain meaningful traction.  On the other hand, more people all over the world are Web literate creating opportunity for new services designed to appeal to new, untapped, groups of users at work and at home. The potential value of the available audience is also poised to explode as the generation that grew up not knowing a world without the Web is moving out of the back bedroom (and off the dole) into the workforce. All of this means that you will see subtle changes in the way we invest our new fund. We will be even more selective about the early stage Web services we back, looking for compelling differentiation, a discrete market focus, and clear evidence of sustainable user growth. You will also see us invest selectively in later stage opportunities that we believe are poised to grow as more users become more dependent on the Web to manage their daily lives. Perhaps the biggest change is that there will be new faces around the office.  Albert Wenger, who has been working closely with us for several years, will be joining us as a partner. Andrew Parker has made himself so essential to the operation of our business that we broke the rules on our two year analyst program and asked him to stay on as an Associate.  We are recruiting a new analyst to take over Andrew’s duties in that area. We are fortunate that we have been able to add to our team without changing the feel of our firm. Albert and Andrew share our passion for start-ups, and our conviction that the Web will continue to be a disruptive force in the global economy.  They also fit well into our collegial culture, where we do our own work, support the entire portfolio, and share the credit and the blame for the outcome.We are pleased that the closing of Union Square Ventures 2008 LP will enable us to continue doing the work we love. We have a tremendous group of supportive institutional limited partners in our first fund and are thrilled that every one of them is participating in Union Square Ventures 2008 LP. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with all of you in the coming years.
