Kirk T. Spencer, MD
Professor of Medicine
Director, Inpatient Cardiology Services
Associate Director, Cardiac Imaging Center
Kirk T. Spencer, MD, is a cardiologist and expert in cardiac imaging. He is a recognized leader in the field of echocardiography, the evaluation of heart function using sound waves. In addition to echocardiography, Dr. Spencer's imaging expertise includes cardiac MRI, a relatively new method to noninvasively assess the structure and function of the heart. His clinical interests include valvular heart disease, transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac stress testing, congestive heart failure and cardiac disease in renal failure/renal transplant.
