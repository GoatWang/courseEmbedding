Best for: The tech-savvy household





"High-speed Internet" doesn't even begin to describe it.
Multiple devices? No problem. Streaming HD video? Easy. Accessing large data files in a flash? Bring 'em on. A home full of gadgets is no match for the full strength of our fiber network, as several users can get the most from their cell phones, laptops and tablets — all at the same time.














Best for: More than just fun and games





Surf the Web like you live your life — in real time.
Get all the Web has to offer, streaming live. Play online games wirelessly, watch news feeds and follow your favorite teams, all without missing a beat. If you want to experience life as it happens, this speed will keep you in the loop.














Best for: The casual Internet user





Do more than just check email.
Don't let its place at the bottom of this list fool you — you can do a lot with 4 Mbps. Download music, shop online, do your banking, use your social networks, connect wireless devices. This is what the Internet is all about, and it's right here at an affordable price.









Bundling Tip: Save money and time by bundling Internet service with FairPoint phone and/or TV service. See local offers for details.

History[edit]
FairPoint was founded as MJD Communications Inc. in 1991, and was established as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) which gave it certain rights and obligations regarding providing service to rural areas.
The company acquired the Cass County Telephone Company in 2006, integrating its operations into FairPoint Communications Missouri. It also acquired the Germantown Independent Telephone Company in Germantown, Ohio.
Northern New England expansion[edit]
In 2007, FairPoint had about 330,000 access points or customers. In that year, Verizon Communications announced plans to sell its landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Northern New England Spinco) to FairPoint for $2.7 billion. Of that amount, $1.7 billion would go to Verizon Communications in cash and debt and approximately $1.015 billion would go to Verizon shareholders in FairPoint common stock. Verizon would hold no stock.
After extensive federal and state regulatory review and approval, the purchase became effective March 31, 2008, for a price of $2.4 billion. State regulators sought a lower figure out of concerns that excess debt would hamper service and expansion.
Approximately 1.6 million phone customers and 230,000 internet users in the three states were added to FairPoint's customer base, with the result that the Northern New England customers represented 85% of FairPoint's customers.[4]
This increase made FairPoint Communications the 8th largest phone company in the United States. Of its nearly 4,000 employees, approximately 80% serve the Northern New England customers.[citation needed]
As part of the purchase, FairPoint had to make broadband available to 83 percent of customers. On January 27, 2011, the company announced it had met this goal. Of its customers 68.9 percent had broadband at the time of the purchase; 44,000 new customers have the service now.[5] FairPoint offers internet through the use of DSL technology.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On May 5, 2009 FairPoint indicated in its First Quarter 2009 Report that it was "considering engaging a financial advisor to evaluate its current capital structure and to explore options with respect to a potential restructuring." It also acknowledged that it was "at risk of failing to comply with the interest coverage covenant contained in its credit facility as early as the covenant measurement period ending June 30, 2009."[6]
If debt arrangements were not made by October 1, 2009, FairPoint was going to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to CEO David Hauser.[7]
On October 26, 2009, FairPoint Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8][9]
As a result of the bankruptcy, Verizon shareholders lost the entire $1.015 billion in shares they had received in the previous year's deal. New England Verizon networks had been profitable before the transfer to FairPoint. After the bankruptcy, the creditors became the initial shareholders of the reorganized FairPoint.[citation needed]
The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2011.[5]
Post-bankruptcy[edit]
Verizon later lost its remaining money it made on the sale.[10] The remaining money from the sale in stock was lost when FairPoint declared bankruptcy. It previously lost all but $5 million from the lawsuit. Since then it has been continually rated as the worst internet provider in the north east due to their constant down time[citation needed].
Payphone sale[edit]

On May 22, 2012, FairPoint announced that it would sell its pay telephone operations to Pacific Telemanagement Services. The deal includes its 4,000 payphones operated through Northern New England Telephone Operations and Telephone Operating Company of Vermont. Fairpoint announced that the phones have become unprofitable at about $1 million in revenue.[11]
2014 Northern New England strike[edit]
On October 14, 2014, FairPoint Communications froze the pensions of nearly 2,000 employees who had built, maintained, and serviced vital telecommunications infrastructure throughout Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The company had already stopped providing retiree health care and support for child and elder care. Workers said that this was all part of FairPoint’s plan to turn their good middle-class jobs into low-wage temporary jobs. Also, the implications and trickle-down-effect, of nearly 2,000 unemployed New England workers, has caused ripples, leading to waves, in local and regional economies throughout the three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont).
Unions representing the employees had been negotiating with the company since April to reach new collective bargaining agreements. Leaders of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) said that FairPoint management abandoned the bargaining process on August 27 after refusing to compromise on any substantive issue since negotiations began.[12]
FairPoint replaced striking workers with contingency workers from as far away as Oregon and California. The replacement workers struggled to maintain any semblance of normal service as a series of nor'easter storms brought rain and snowy winter conditions to the three-state area. FairPoint spokeswoman Angelynne Beaudry acknowledged that “long answer times had customers calling back multiple times.” Beaudry admitted that FairPoint has struggled to respond to service requests, and said company officials “regret some of our customers have been inconvenienced as we had to reschedule their appointments.”[13]
Purchase by Consolidated Communications[edit]
In December 2016 FairPoint was purchased by Consolidated Communications for $1.5 billion including assumption of debt. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-2017 pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The combined company will operate under the Consolidated Communications name.[14]
Service areas[edit]
FairPoint owns the following operating companies:

Big Sandy Telecom – Simla, Colorado[15]
Columbine Telecom Company – Crestone and Mosca, Colorado[16]
FairPoint Communications Missouri
GTCOM, Inc.
Northern New England Telephone Operations – Maine, New Hampshire (formerly part of Verizon New England)

History[edit]
FairPoint was founded as MJD Communications Inc. in 1991, and was established as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) which gave it certain rights and obligations regarding providing service to rural areas.
The company acquired the Cass County Telephone Company in 2006, integrating its operations into FairPoint Communications Missouri. It also acquired the Germantown Independent Telephone Company in Germantown, Ohio.
Northern New England expansion[edit]
In 2007, FairPoint had about 330,000 access points or customers. In that year, Verizon Communications announced plans to sell its landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Northern New England Spinco) to FairPoint for $2.7 billion. Of that amount, $1.7 billion would go to Verizon Communications in cash and debt and approximately $1.015 billion would go to Verizon shareholders in FairPoint common stock. Verizon would hold no stock.
After extensive federal and state regulatory review and approval, the purchase became effective March 31, 2008, for a price of $2.4 billion. State regulators sought a lower figure out of concerns that excess debt would hamper service and expansion.
Approximately 1.6 million phone customers and 230,000 internet users in the three states were added to FairPoint's customer base, with the result that the Northern New England customers represented 85% of FairPoint's customers.[4]
This increase made FairPoint Communications the 8th largest phone company in the United States. Of its nearly 4,000 employees, approximately 80% serve the Northern New England customers.[citation needed]
As part of the purchase, FairPoint had to make broadband available to 83 percent of customers. On January 27, 2011, the company announced it had met this goal. Of its customers 68.9 percent had broadband at the time of the purchase; 44,000 new customers have the service now.[5] FairPoint offers internet through the use of DSL technology.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On May 5, 2009 FairPoint indicated in its First Quarter 2009 Report that it was "considering engaging a financial advisor to evaluate its current capital structure and to explore options with respect to a potential restructuring." It also acknowledged that it was "at risk of failing to comply with the interest coverage covenant contained in its credit facility as early as the covenant measurement period ending June 30, 2009."[6]
If debt arrangements were not made by October 1, 2009, FairPoint was going to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to CEO David Hauser.[7]
On October 26, 2009, FairPoint Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8][9]
As a result of the bankruptcy, Verizon shareholders lost the entire $1.015 billion in shares they had received in the previous year's deal. New England Verizon networks had been profitable before the transfer to FairPoint. After the bankruptcy, the creditors became the initial shareholders of the reorganized FairPoint.[citation needed]
The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2011.[5]
Post-bankruptcy[edit]
Verizon later lost its remaining money it made on the sale.[10] The remaining money from the sale in stock was lost when FairPoint declared bankruptcy. It previously lost all but $5 million from the lawsuit. Since then it has been continually rated as the worst internet provider in the north east due to their constant down time[citation needed].

History[edit]
FairPoint was founded as MJD Communications Inc. in 1991, and was established as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) which gave it certain rights and obligations regarding providing service to rural areas.
The company acquired the Cass County Telephone Company in 2006, integrating its operations into FairPoint Communications Missouri. It also acquired the Germantown Independent Telephone Company in Germantown, Ohio.
Northern New England expansion[edit]
In 2007, FairPoint had about 330,000 access points or customers. In that year, Verizon Communications announced plans to sell its landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Northern New England Spinco) to FairPoint for $2.7 billion. Of that amount, $1.7 billion would go to Verizon Communications in cash and debt and approximately $1.015 billion would go to Verizon shareholders in FairPoint common stock. Verizon would hold no stock.
After extensive federal and state regulatory review and approval, the purchase became effective March 31, 2008, for a price of $2.4 billion. State regulators sought a lower figure out of concerns that excess debt would hamper service and expansion.
Approximately 1.6 million phone customers and 230,000 internet users in the three states were added to FairPoint's customer base, with the result that the Northern New England customers represented 85% of FairPoint's customers.[4]
This increase made FairPoint Communications the 8th largest phone company in the United States. Of its nearly 4,000 employees, approximately 80% serve the Northern New England customers.[citation needed]
As part of the purchase, FairPoint had to make broadband available to 83 percent of customers. On January 27, 2011, the company announced it had met this goal. Of its customers 68.9 percent had broadband at the time of the purchase; 44,000 new customers have the service now.[5] FairPoint offers internet through the use of DSL technology.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On May 5, 2009 FairPoint indicated in its First Quarter 2009 Report that it was "considering engaging a financial advisor to evaluate its current capital structure and to explore options with respect to a potential restructuring." It also acknowledged that it was "at risk of failing to comply with the interest coverage covenant contained in its credit facility as early as the covenant measurement period ending June 30, 2009."[6]
If debt arrangements were not made by October 1, 2009, FairPoint was going to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to CEO David Hauser.[7]
On October 26, 2009, FairPoint Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8][9]
As a result of the bankruptcy, Verizon shareholders lost the entire $1.015 billion in shares they had received in the previous year's deal. New England Verizon networks had been profitable before the transfer to FairPoint. After the bankruptcy, the creditors became the initial shareholders of the reorganized FairPoint.[citation needed]
The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2011.[5]
Post-bankruptcy[edit]
Verizon later lost its remaining money it made on the sale.[10] The remaining money from the sale in stock was lost when FairPoint declared bankruptcy. It previously lost all but $5 million from the lawsuit. Since then it has been continually rated as the worst internet provider in the north east due to their constant down time[citation needed].
Payphone sale[edit]




FairPoint payphone in Randolph, Vermont in 2012


On May 22, 2012, FairPoint announced that it would sell its pay telephone operations to Pacific Telemanagement Services. The deal includes its 4,000 payphones operated through Northern New England Telephone Operations and Telephone Operating Company of Vermont. Fairpoint announced that the phones have become unprofitable at about $1 million in revenue.[11]
2014 Northern New England strike[edit]
On October 14, 2014, FairPoint Communications froze the pensions of nearly 2,000 employees who had built, maintained, and serviced vital telecommunications infrastructure throughout Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The company had already stopped providing retiree health care and support for child and elder care. Workers said that this was all part of FairPoint’s plan to turn their good middle-class jobs into low-wage temporary jobs. Also, the implications and trickle-down-effect, of nearly 2,000 unemployed New England workers, has caused ripples, leading to waves, in local and regional economies throughout the three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont).
Unions representing the employees had been negotiating with the company since April to reach new collective bargaining agreements. Leaders of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) said that FairPoint management abandoned the bargaining process on August 27 after refusing to compromise on any substantive issue since negotiations began.[12]
FairPoint replaced striking workers with contingency workers from as far away as Oregon and California. The replacement workers struggled to maintain any semblance of normal service as a series of nor'easter storms brought rain and snowy winter conditions to the three-state area. FairPoint spokeswoman Angelynne Beaudry acknowledged that “long answer times had customers calling back multiple times.” Beaudry admitted that FairPoint has struggled to respond to service requests, and said company officials “regret some of our customers have been inconvenienced as we had to reschedule their appointments.”[13]
Purchase by Consolidated Communications[edit]
In December 2016 FairPoint was purchased by Consolidated Communications for $1.5 billion including assumption of debt. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-2017 pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The combined company will operate under the Consolidated Communications name.[14]
Service areas[edit]
FairPoint owns the following operating companies:

Big Sandy Telecom – Simla, Colorado[15]
Columbine Telecom Company – Crestone and Mosca, Colorado[16]
FairPoint Communications Missouri

 FairPoint Communications, Inc. Acquisition May Not Be in the Best Interests of FRP Shareholders 
         










    










 













 











 



















FairPoint Communications, Inc. Acquisition May Not Be in the Best Interests of FRP Shareholders

WeissLaw LLP

 Share this article




























































NEW YORK, Dec. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of FairPoint Communications, Inc. ("FRP" or the "Company") in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. ("CNSL").  On December 5, 2016, FRP announced it had reached a definitive agreement for CNSL to acquire all outstanding shares of FRP in an all-stock transaction valued at $1.5 billion, inclusive of debt.  Under the terms of the agreement, FRP shareholders will receive 0.73 of a CNSL share; representing consideration of $19.86, based on CNSL's December 5 closing price. 








WeissLaw is investigating whether FRP's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $20.00.  Moreover, according to Bob Udell, CNSL's President and CEO, the transaction "significantly expands [CNSL's] broadband reach and scale, and is cash flow accretive upon close."   Further, the acquisition of the Company increases CNSL's market share, adding the 17 states in which FRP operates and more than 21,000 miles of fiber routes; making CNSL the ninth-largest fiber provider in the U.S., with 35,100 miles of fiber across 24 states.  Finally, upon completion of the transaction, FRP shareholders will own a meagre 28.7% of the combined company.  
Given these facts, WeissLaw is investigating the Board of Directors' decision to sell FRP and whether FRP shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and future growth prospects.  If you own FRP shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com.   
WeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.  We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.  If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/fairpoint-communications-inc/

History[edit]
FairPoint was founded as MJD Communications Inc. in 1991, and was established as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) which gave it certain rights and obligations regarding providing service to rural areas.
The company acquired the Cass County Telephone Company in 2006, integrating its operations into FairPoint Communications Missouri. It also acquired the Germantown Independent Telephone Company in Germantown, Ohio.
Northern New England expansion[edit]
In 2007, FairPoint had about 330,000 access points or customers. In that year, Verizon Communications announced plans to sell its landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Northern New England Spinco) to FairPoint for $2.7 billion. Of that amount, $1.7 billion would go to Verizon Communications in cash and debt and approximately $1.015 billion would go to Verizon shareholders in FairPoint common stock. Verizon would hold no stock.
After extensive federal and state regulatory review and approval, the purchase became effective March 31, 2008, for a price of $2.4 billion. State regulators sought a lower figure out of concerns that excess debt would hamper service and expansion.
Approximately 1.6 million phone customers and 230,000 internet users in the three states were added to FairPoint's customer base, with the result that the Northern New England customers represented 85% of FairPoint's customers.[4]
This increase made FairPoint Communications the 8th largest phone company in the United States. Of its nearly 4,000 employees, approximately 80% serve the Northern New England customers.[citation needed]
As part of the purchase, FairPoint had to make broadband available to 83 percent of customers. On January 27, 2011, the company announced it had met this goal. Of its customers 68.9 percent had broadband at the time of the purchase; 44,000 new customers have the service now.[5] FairPoint offers internet through the use of DSL technology.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On May 5, 2009 FairPoint indicated in its First Quarter 2009 Report that it was "considering engaging a financial advisor to evaluate its current capital structure and to explore options with respect to a potential restructuring." It also acknowledged that it was "at risk of failing to comply with the interest coverage covenant contained in its credit facility as early as the covenant measurement period ending June 30, 2009."[6]
If debt arrangements were not made by October 1, 2009, FairPoint was going to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to CEO David Hauser.[7]
On October 26, 2009, FairPoint Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8][9]
As a result of the bankruptcy, Verizon shareholders lost the entire $1.015 billion in shares they had received in the previous year's deal. New England Verizon networks had been profitable before the transfer to FairPoint. After the bankruptcy, the creditors became the initial shareholders of the reorganized FairPoint.[citation needed]
The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2011.[5]
Post-bankruptcy[edit]
Verizon later lost its remaining money it made on the sale.[10] The remaining money from the sale in stock was lost when FairPoint declared bankruptcy. It previously lost all but $5 million from the lawsuit. Since then it has been continually rated as the worst internet provider in the north east due to their constant down time[citation needed].
Payphone sale[edit]




FairPoint payphone in Randolph, Vermont in 2012


On May 22, 2012, FairPoint announced that it would sell its pay telephone operations to Pacific Telemanagement Services. The deal includes its 4,000 payphones operated through Northern New England Telephone Operations and Telephone Operating Company of Vermont. Fairpoint announced that the phones have become unprofitable at about $1 million in revenue.[11]
2014 Northern New England strike[edit]
On October 14, 2014, FairPoint Communications froze the pensions of nearly 2,000 employees who had built, maintained, and serviced vital telecommunications infrastructure throughout Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The company had already stopped providing retiree health care and support for child and elder care. Workers said that this was all part of FairPoint’s plan to turn their good middle-class jobs into low-wage temporary jobs. Also, the implications and trickle-down-effect, of nearly 2,000 unemployed New England workers, has caused ripples, leading to waves, in local and regional economies throughout the three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont).
Unions representing the employees had been negotiating with the company since April to reach new collective bargaining agreements. Leaders of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) said that FairPoint management abandoned the bargaining process on August 27 after refusing to compromise on any substantive issue since negotiations began.[12]
FairPoint replaced striking workers with contingency workers from as far away as Oregon and California. The replacement workers struggled to maintain any semblance of normal service as a series of nor'easter storms brought rain and snowy winter conditions to the three-state area. FairPoint spokeswoman Angelynne Beaudry acknowledged that “long answer times had customers calling back multiple times.” Beaudry admitted that FairPoint has struggled to respond to service requests, and said company officials “regret some of our customers have been inconvenienced as we had to reschedule their appointments.”[13]
Purchase by Consolidated Communications[edit]
In December 2016 FairPoint was purchased by Consolidated Communications for $1.5 billion including assumption of debt. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-2017 pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The combined company will operate under the Consolidated Communications name.[14]
Service areas[edit]
FairPoint owns the following operating companies:

Big Sandy Telecom – Simla, Colorado[15]
Columbine Telecom Company – Crestone and Mosca, Colorado[16]
FairPoint Communications Missouri
GTCOM, Inc.
Northern New England Telephone Operations – Maine, New Hampshire (formerly part of Verizon New England)
Sunflower Telephone Company – Kansas, Colorado
Telephone Operating Company of Vermont (formerly part of Verizon New England)

FairPoint Communications, Inc. is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and operates communication services in 31 markets in 17 states, mostly in rural areas. FairPoint services include local and long distance phone service, data, Internet, broadband, television, business communications solutions and fiber services.[3] FairPoint, along with Frontier Communications, has been at the forefront of acquiring Verizon landline operations in past years.

History[edit]
FairPoint was founded as MJD Communications Inc. in 1991, and was established as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) which gave it certain rights and obligations regarding providing service to rural areas.
The company acquired the Cass County Telephone Company in 2006, integrating its operations into FairPoint Communications Missouri. It also acquired the Germantown Independent Telephone Company in Germantown, Ohio.
Northern New England expansion[edit]
In 2007, FairPoint had about 330,000 access points or customers. In that year, Verizon Communications announced plans to sell its landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Northern New England Spinco) to FairPoint for $2.7 billion. Of that amount, $1.7 billion would go to Verizon Communications in cash and debt and approximately $1.015 billion would go to Verizon shareholders in FairPoint common stock. Verizon would hold no stock.
After extensive federal and state regulatory review and approval, the purchase became effective March 31, 2008, for a price of $2.4 billion. State regulators sought a lower figure out of concerns that excess debt would hamper service and expansion.
Approximately 1.6 million phone customers and 230,000 internet users in the three states were added to FairPoint's customer base, with the result that the Northern New England customers represented 85% of FairPoint's customers.[4]
This increase made FairPoint Communications the 8th largest phone company in the United States. Of its nearly 4,000 employees, approximately 80% serve the Northern New England customers.[citation needed]
As part of the purchase, FairPoint had to make broadband available to 83 percent of customers. On January 27, 2011, the company announced it had met this goal. Of its customers 68.9 percent had broadband at the time of the purchase; 44,000 new customers have the service now.[5] FairPoint offers internet through the use of DSL technology.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On May 5, 2009 FairPoint indicated in its First Quarter 2009 Report that it was "considering engaging a financial advisor to evaluate its current capital structure and to explore options with respect to a potential restructuring." It also acknowledged that it was "at risk of failing to comply with the interest coverage covenant contained in its credit facility as early as the covenant measurement period ending June 30, 2009."[6]
If debt arrangements were not made by October 1, 2009, FairPoint was going to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to CEO David Hauser.[7]
On October 26, 2009, FairPoint Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8][9]
As a result of the bankruptcy, Verizon shareholders lost the entire $1.015 billion in shares they had received in the previous year's deal. New England Verizon networks had been profitable before the transfer to FairPoint. After the bankruptcy, the creditors became the initial shareholders of the reorganized FairPoint.[citation needed]
The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2011.[5]
Post-bankruptcy[edit]
Verizon later lost its remaining money it made on the sale.[10] The remaining money from the sale in stock was lost when FairPoint declared bankruptcy. It previously lost all but $5 million from the lawsuit. Since then it has been continually rated as the worst internet provider in the north east due to their constant down time[citation needed].
Payphone sale[edit]




FairPoint payphone in Randolph, Vermont in 2012


On May 22, 2012, FairPoint announced that it would sell its pay telephone operations to Pacific Telemanagement Services. The deal includes its 4,000 payphones operated through Northern New England Telephone Operations and Telephone Operating Company of Vermont. Fairpoint announced that the phones have become unprofitable at about $1 million in revenue.[11]
2014 Northern New England strike[edit]
On October 14, 2014, FairPoint Communications froze the pensions of nearly 2,000 employees who had built, maintained, and serviced vital telecommunications infrastructure throughout Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The company had already stopped providing retiree health care and support for child and elder care. Workers said that this was all part of FairPoint’s plan to turn their good middle-class jobs into low-wage temporary jobs. Also, the implications and trickle-down-effect, of nearly 2,000 unemployed New England workers, has caused ripples, leading to waves, in local and regional economies throughout the three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont).
Unions representing the employees had been negotiating with the company since April to reach new collective bargaining agreements. Leaders of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) said that FairPoint management abandoned the bargaining process on August 27 after refusing to compromise on any substantive issue since negotiations began.[12]
FairPoint replaced striking workers with contingency workers from as far away as Oregon and California. The replacement workers struggled to maintain any semblance of normal service as a series of nor'easter storms brought rain and snowy winter conditions to the three-state area. FairPoint spokeswoman Angelynne Beaudry acknowledged that “long answer times had customers calling back multiple times.” Beaudry admitted that FairPoint has struggled to respond to service requests, and said company officials “regret some of our customers have been inconvenienced as we had to reschedule their appointments.”[13]
Purchase by Consolidated Communications[edit]
In December 2016 FairPoint was purchased by Consolidated Communications for $1.5 billion including assumption of debt. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-2017 pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The combined company will operate under the Consolidated Communications name.[14]
Service areas[edit]
FairPoint owns the following operating companies:

Big Sandy Telecom – Simla, Colorado[15]
Columbine Telecom Company – Crestone and Mosca, Colorado[16]
FairPoint Communications Missouri
GTCOM, Inc.
Northern New England Telephone Operations – Maine, New Hampshire (formerly part of Verizon New England)
Sunflower Telephone Company – Kansas, Colorado
Telephone Operating Company of Vermont (formerly part of Verizon New England)

History[edit]
FairPoint was founded as MJD Communications Inc. in 1991, and was established as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) which gave it certain rights and obligations regarding providing service to rural areas.
The company acquired the Cass County Telephone Company in 2006, integrating its operations into FairPoint Communications Missouri. It also acquired the Germantown Independent Telephone Company in Germantown, Ohio.
Northern New England expansion[edit]
In 2007, FairPoint had about 330,000 access points or customers. In that year, Verizon Communications announced plans to sell its landline operations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Northern New England Spinco) to FairPoint for $2.7 billion. Of that amount, $1.7 billion would go to Verizon Communications in cash and debt and approximately $1.015 billion would go to Verizon shareholders in FairPoint common stock. Verizon would hold no stock.
After extensive federal and state regulatory review and approval, the purchase became effective March 31, 2008, for a price of $2.4 billion. State regulators sought a lower figure out of concerns that excess debt would hamper service and expansion.
Approximately 1.6 million phone customers and 230,000 internet users in the three states were added to FairPoint's customer base, with the result that the Northern New England customers represented 85% of FairPoint's customers.[4]
This increase made FairPoint Communications the 8th largest phone company in the United States. Of its nearly 4,000 employees, approximately 80% serve the Northern New England customers.[citation needed]
As part of the purchase, FairPoint had to make broadband available to 83 percent of customers. On January 27, 2011, the company announced it had met this goal. Of its customers 68.9 percent had broadband at the time of the purchase; 44,000 new customers have the service now.[5] FairPoint offers internet through the use of DSL technology.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On May 5, 2009 FairPoint indicated in its First Quarter 2009 Report that it was "considering engaging a financial advisor to evaluate its current capital structure and to explore options with respect to a potential restructuring." It also acknowledged that it was "at risk of failing to comply with the interest coverage covenant contained in its credit facility as early as the covenant measurement period ending June 30, 2009."[6]
If debt arrangements were not made by October 1, 2009, FairPoint was going to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to CEO David Hauser.[7]
On October 26, 2009, FairPoint Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8][9]
As a result of the bankruptcy, Verizon shareholders lost the entire $1.015 billion in shares they had received in the previous year's deal. New England Verizon networks had been profitable before the transfer to FairPoint. After the bankruptcy, the creditors became the initial shareholders of the reorganized FairPoint.[citation needed]
The company emerged from bankruptcy in January 2011.[5]
Post-bankruptcy[edit]
Verizon later lost its remaining money it made on the sale.[10] The remaining money from the sale in stock was lost when FairPoint declared bankruptcy. It previously lost all but $5 million from the lawsuit. Since then it has been continually rated as the worst internet provider in the north east due to their constant down time[citation needed].
Payphone sale[edit]




FairPoint payphone in Randolph, Vermont in 2012


On May 22, 2012, FairPoint announced that it would sell its pay telephone operations to Pacific Telemanagement Services. The deal includes its 4,000 payphones operated through Northern New England Telephone Operations and Telephone Operating Company of Vermont. Fairpoint announced that the phones have become unprofitable at about $1 million in revenue.[11]
2014 Northern New England strike[edit]
On October 14, 2014, FairPoint Communications froze the pensions of nearly 2,000 employees who had built, maintained, and serviced vital telecommunications infrastructure throughout Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The company had already stopped providing retiree health care and support for child and elder care. Workers said that this was all part of FairPoint’s plan to turn their good middle-class jobs into low-wage temporary jobs. Also, the implications and trickle-down-effect, of nearly 2,000 unemployed New England workers, has caused ripples, leading to waves, in local and regional economies throughout the three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont).
Unions representing the employees had been negotiating with the company since April to reach new collective bargaining agreements. Leaders of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) said that FairPoint management abandoned the bargaining process on August 27 after refusing to compromise on any substantive issue since negotiations began.[12]
FairPoint replaced striking workers with contingency workers from as far away as Oregon and California. The replacement workers struggled to maintain any semblance of normal service as a series of nor'easter storms brought rain and snowy winter conditions to the three-state area. FairPoint spokeswoman Angelynne Beaudry acknowledged that “long answer times had customers calling back multiple times.” Beaudry admitted that FairPoint has struggled to respond to service requests, and said company officials “regret some of our customers have been inconvenienced as we had to reschedule their appointments.”[13]
Purchase by Consolidated Communications[edit]
In December 2016 FairPoint was purchased by Consolidated Communications for $1.5 billion including assumption of debt. The acquisition is expected to close by mid-2017 pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The combined company will operate under the Consolidated Communications name.[14]
Service areas[edit]
FairPoint owns the following operating companies:

Big Sandy Telecom – Simla, Colorado[15]
Columbine Telecom Company – Crestone and Mosca, Colorado[16]
FairPoint Communications Missouri
GTCOM, Inc.
Northern New England Telephone Operations – Maine, New Hampshire (formerly part of Verizon New England)
Sunflower Telephone Company – Kansas, Colorado
Telephone Operating Company of Vermont (formerly part of Verizon New England)

Former operating companies[edit]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
