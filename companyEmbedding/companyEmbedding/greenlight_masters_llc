New Century Financial Corporation
18400 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 1000
Irvine, California 92612

Attention Corporate Secretary

Re: Stockholder’s Notice of Intent to Nominate Director Candidates

Dear Sir or Madam:

Greenlight Capital, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Record Owner” or “Greenlight LP”),
hereby submits this notice (this “Notice”) of intent to nominate David Einhorn, David A. Cohen and
Thomas J. Edelman (each a “Nominee” and collectively the “Nominees”) for election to the Board of
Directors (the “Board”) of New Century Financial Corporation (“New Century”) at the 2006 Annual
Meeting of the Stockholders, and any adjournments or postponements thereof (the “2006 Meeting”),
pursuant to Section 2.8 of the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) of New Century
filed as Exhibit 3.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“Commission”) on October 31, 2005.

The record address of the Record Owner is 140 East 45th Street, Floor 24, New York, New York 10017.
The Record Owner currently holds of record 100 shares (the “Record Shares”) of common stock, par
value $0.01 (“Common Stock”), of New Century. In addition to the Record Shares, the Record Owner
holds 612,900 shares of Common Stock through its account with Goldman Sachs & Co. The Record Owner
may be deemed to “beneficially own” (within the meaning of such term under Section 13(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Regulation 13D-G thereunder)
such 613,000 shares of Common Stock. Other than such 613,000 shares of Common Stock, the Record
Owner does not “beneficially own” (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
Regulation 13D-G thereunder) any other shares of New Century. Greenlight Capital, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company (“Greenlight LLC”), directs the voting and disposition of the
Record Shares, as well as the other shares held by the Record Owner, as the general partner of the
Record Owner and as such may be deemed the “beneficial owner” of the Record Shares and such other
shares within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 13D-G thereunder.
The address for Greenlight LLC is 140 East 45th Street, Floor 24, New York, New York 10017.
Greenlight LLC also serves as the general partner and directs the voting and disposition of
1,902,300 shares of Common Stock held by Greenlight Capital Qualified, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (“Greenlight Qualified”), through its account with Goldman Sachs & Co. The address for
Greenlight Qualified is 140 East 45th Street, Floor 24, New York, New York 10017. Greenlight LLC
may be deemed the “beneficial owner” (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
Regulation 13D-G thereunder) of an aggregate of 2,515,300 shares of Common Stock, consisting of the
613,000 shares held by the Record Owner and the 1,902,300 shares held by Greenlight Qualified.
Greenlight LLC does not own of record any shares of stock of New Century and other than the 2,515,300 shares of Common Stock described
above, does not “beneficially own” (within the meaning of



 



 

Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
Regulation 13D-G thereunder) any other shares of stock of New Century. An affiliate of Greenlight
LLC, Greenlight Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Greenlight Inc”), acts as the investment
advisor for Greenlight Capital Offshore, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands international business
company (“Greenlight Offshore”), which is the holder of 2,583,900 shares of Common Stock through
its account with Goldman Sachs & Co. Greenlight Inc’s address is 140 East 45th Street, Floor 24,
New York, New York 10017. Greenlight Offshore’s address is c/o Citco BVI Limited, Citco Building,
Wickhams Cay 1, P.O. Box 662, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. Another affiliate of
Greenlight LLC, DME Advisors, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“DME”), is an investment advisor
to a managed account which is the holder of 400,800 shares of Common Stock through its account with
Goldman Sachs & Co. DME’s address is 140 East 45th Street, Floor 24, New York, New York 10017.
David Einhorn is the Senior Managing Member of Greenlight LLC and DME Advisors GP, LLC, the general
partner of DME (“DME GP” and, collectively with DME, Greenlight LLC and Greenlight Inc, the
"Management Entities”), and the President of Greenlight Inc. DME GP’s address is 140 East 45th
Street, Floor 24, New York, New York 10017. As the principal executive officer of each of the
Management Entities, David Einhorn directs the voting and disposition of all of the 5,500,000
shares of Common Stock described above and, therefore, may be deemed the “beneficial owner” of all
of such shares within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 13D-G
thereunder. David Einhorn does not own of record any shares of stock of New Century and other than
the 5,500,000 shares described above, does not “beneficially own” (within the meaning of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 13D-G thereunder) any other shares of stock of New
Century. David Einhorn’s address is 140 East 45th Street, Floor 24, New York, New York 10017. If
the Record Owner, Greenlight Qualified, Mr. Einhorn and the Management Entities were deemed to be a
“group” for the purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Regulation 13D-G thereunder, such
group would be deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of all such 5,500,000 shares.

The Record Owner hereby represents that it: (i) is a stockholder of record of New Century entitled
to vote at the 2006 Meeting, (ii) intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders
of at least the percentage of New Century’s outstanding capital stock required to elect the
Nominees at the 2006 Meeting, and (iii) intends to appear in person or by proxy at the 2006 Meeting
to nominate the Nominees.

To the knowledge of the Record Owner, the Board consists of ten directors and only three candidates
will be nominated for election at the 2006 Meeting. If, for any reason, more than three directors
are to be elected at the 2006 Meeting, the Record Owner reserves the right to nominate additional
persons to be so elected (each such additional nominee, an “Additional Nominee”). Additionally, if
a Nominee or an Additional Nominee is unable to stand for election at the 2006 Meeting for any
reason, the Record Owner intends to nominate a substitute candidate to stand for election at the
2006 Meeting. The Record Owner will provide notice to New Century as soon as practicable after
identifying such substitute nominee or Additional Nominee.

Attached as Annex A hereto, and by this reference incorporated in this Notice, is information
relating to each of the Nominees required by the Bylaws. All of the Annexes to this Notice are
incorporated into and made a part of this Notice. Accordingly, all matters disclosed in any part
of this Notice, including the Annexes and under any heading therein, shall be deemed disclosed
for all purposes of this Notice. Certain capitalized terms used in the Annexes and not defined
therein are defined in this Notice.

Please be advised that, notwithstanding our compliance with the requirements relating to the
provision of notice relating to the nomination of director candidates by stockholders of New
Century in the Bylaws (the “Bylaw Requirements”), neither the delivery of this notice in accordance
with the terms of the Bylaw Requirements nor the delivery of any additional information, if any,
provided by us from and after the date hereof shall be deemed to constitute an admission by us of
the legality or enforceability of the Bylaw Requirements or a waiver by us of our right to, in any
way, contest or challenge the enforceability thereof.

The Nominees have each consented to stand for election, to being named in the proxy statement to be
filed by the Record Owner or any of its affiliates with the Commission and to stand as director if
elected. Such consents are attached hereto as Annexes B, C and D, which annexes are incorporated
herein by reference.

It is our belief that we have complied with all of the requirements to provide notice to New
Century of the intent to nominate directors for the 2006 Meeting. Please advise us if you believe
there are any deficiencies in this Notice.

Leverage or Margin: While a portion of the purchase price or market value of the shares of
which Mr. Einhorn may be deemed the beneficial owner was represented by funds borrowed or otherwise
obtained for the purpose of acquiring or holding such securities, at the present time, all

A-6



 

such shares are held in a cash account and no borrowings are currently in effect with respect to
such shares. The portion of the purchase price or market value of the shares that was represented
by funds borrowed or otherwise obtained was pursuant to a brokerage margin account.

Contracts, Arrangements or Understandings: Except as disclosed in this Notice, neither Mr.
Einhorn, the Management Entities, the Greenlight Funds nor any other entity affiliated with Mr.
Einhorn is, or has been within the past year, a party to any contract, arrangement or understanding
with any person with respect to any securities of New Century, including but not limited to joint
ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees against loss or guarantees of
profit, division of losses or profits, or the giving or withholding of proxies.

Other Interests Relating to New Century: Each of the Greenlight Funds is a party to a cash-settled
equity-based swap contract pursuant to a standard ISDA form and swap confirmation with an
independent bank counterparty based on the value of a specified number of shares of Common Stock
(the “Basket”). Pursuant to the terms of each swap contract, if the per share price of the Common
Stock is greater than $36.55 as of the payment date, the swap counterparty must pay the respective
Greenlight Fund the product of (a) the number of shares in the Basket on the payment date,
multiplied by (b) the volume weighted average price per share on the payment date, less $36.55 per
share, subject to set off versus such Greenlight Fund’s payment obligation. In the event that the
per share price of the Common Stock is less than $36.55 as of the payment date, the respective
Greenlight Fund must pay the swap counterparty the product of (a) the number of shares in the
Basket on the payment date, multiplied by (b) $36.55 per share, less the volume weighted average
price per share on the payment date. On the payment date, each Greenlight Fund must pay the swap
counterparty an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of reference shares in the Basket,
multiplied by (b) $36.55, multiplied by (c) an annual rate of interest of the one day federal funds
rate plus fifty basis points, subject to set off versus the swap counterparty’s payment obligation.
Each swap is scheduled to terminate on October 4, 2006. Each swap may be terminated on two days’
notice from the respective Greenlight Fund. The Basket for the Greenlight Funds in the aggregate
is 2,091,800 shares of Common Stock, divided among the Greenlight Funds as follows: the Basket for
Greenlight LP is an aggregate 167,900 shares of Common Stock; the Basket for Greenlight Qualified
is an aggregate 811,500 shares of Common Stock; the Basket for Greenlight Offshore is an aggregate
954,600 shares of Common Stock; and the Basket for the account managed by DME is an aggregate
157,800 shares of Capital Stock. The Greenlight Funds do not have the right to vote any shares of
Common Stock or dispose of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any swap contract, and the
counterparty is under no obligation to purchase, sell or hold any shares of Common Stock. In
addition, the swaps may only be settled for cash.

Transactions with New Century: There has not been since the beginning of New Century’s last fiscal
year, and there is not currently proposed, any transaction, or series of similar transactions, to
which New Century or any of its subsidiaries was or is a party, in which the amount involved
exceeds $60,000 and in which Mr. Einhorn, the Management Entities, the Greenlight Funds, any other
