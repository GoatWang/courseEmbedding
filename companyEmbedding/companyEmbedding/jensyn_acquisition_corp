Jensyn Acquisition Corporation Completes $39.0 Million Initial Public Offering

Mar 07, 2016, 14:07 ET
		  		  			
									 from   Jensyn Acquisition Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, March 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Jensyn Acquisition Corporation (the "Company"), an information technology consulting-focused special purpose entity formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, today announced the closing of its initial public offering of 3,900,000 units. The offering was priced at $10.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $39,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company.
The Company's units began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol "JSYNU" on March 3, 2016. Each unit consists of one share of the Company's common stock, one warrant and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Company's common stock automatically on the consummation of an initial business combination. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one share of the Company's common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock, warrants and rights are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbols "JSYN" and "JSYNW" and "JSYNR," respectively.  
Chardan served as the sole book-running manager for this initial public offering, with Maxim Group LLC as co-manager. 
The offering was made only by means of a prospectus. When available, copies of the prospectus related to this offering may be obtained from Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, Attn.: Prospectus Department, 17 State Street, Suite 1600, New York, NY 10004, email: prospectus@chardancm.com, tel: (646) 465-9000.
A registration statement relating to the securities has been declared effective by the SEC on March 2, 2016. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. 
This press release contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements," including with respect to the anticipated use of the net proceeds. No assurance can be given that the net proceeds of the offering will be used as indicated. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company's registration statement and preliminary prospectus for the Company's offering filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Copies are available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required by law.

About Jensyn
IT Consulting is a highly fragmented industry with over 430,000 companies accepted as a critical outsource for all businesses, typically resulting in long-term customer loyalty and future growth potential in emerging technology fields (cloud computing, cyber security, healthcare, mobile applications, big data). Our focus is on acquiring an initial platform company specializing in application design, integration and maintenance at the enterprise, mobile, digital and cloud levels. We will then target smaller, complementary companies, such as IT staffing or niche markets, to support staffing needs, expand geographically, diversify products and services, promote cross-selling opportunities and enhance shareholder value. Our team is experienced in IT consulting, staffing and M&A, and has developed a plan to capitalize on this initial acquisition as well as grow the company organically and through smaller, complementary acquisitions.

Target sectors include financial services, healthcare, government, manufacturing and retail, communications and technical. 
Revenue between $75 million to $175 million 
Historical EBITDA over 10%
Historical multiyear profitable revenue growth
Historical Gross margins over 30%

$40,365,000, or $46,419,750 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax
obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption
of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay
converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, a company owned by our
insiders, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to
the terms of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a
determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside
the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial
business combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be
due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial
business combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Jensyn Integration
Services, LLC for our benefit. We believe that the fee charged by Jensyn
Integration Services, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of
our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of
any kind (including finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation) will be paid to our insiders, members of our management team or
any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to
or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and
business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Since the role of present management after our initial business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after our initial business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering and insider loans available to us out of trust for
our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business
combination will be approximately $465,000.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account available
to us, represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the
event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of
such proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the
costs of undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available to us from the trust account is insufficient as a result of
the current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC in an
amount equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon
consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used
to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of December 31, 2015, our insiders and a related party had loaned or advanced
to us an aggregate of $362,320 to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of
this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee,
FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses. The loans are payable
without interest no later than the date on which our initial business
combination is consummated.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $700,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued 77,000 shares of common stock if $700,000 of notes were so converted
since the 70,000 rights included in the private units would result in the
issuance of 7,000 shares of common stock upon the closing of our business
combination, as well as 70,000 warrants to purchase 35,000 shares). Our
stockholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of
such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time
of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a
business combination, the $497,320 of loans and advances from our insiders and a
related party, and any other outstanding loans from our insiders, officers and
directors or their affiliates, will be repaid only from amounts remaining
outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with
utilizing the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in
completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be
limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

• our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business 
  combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a 
  transaction;

• our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public 
  stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business
  combination;

• our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential
  future dilution they represent;

• our obligation to ensure that if we enter into a definitive agreement for a
  business combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the
  definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the 
  same per share consideration the holders of the common stock will receive in 
  the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis (for instance, if 
  the business combination would result in each share of common stock 
  outstanding being exchanged for two shares of common stock, each right would 
  result in the holder receiving two-tenths (2/10) of a share of common stock 
  upon consummation of such business combination);

• our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to Chardan Capital 
  Markets, LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination;

• our obligation to either repay or issue private units upon conversion of up to
  $700,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our insiders,
  officers, directors or their affiliates;

• our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the
  private units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our 
  insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working 
  capital loans; and

• the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities
  under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us
  prior to the consummation of a business combination.

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however,
that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States
public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held
entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an
initial business combination with a target business with significant growth
potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in
all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business.
Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or
ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on
October 8, 2014. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or
other similar business combination, which we refer to


 throughout this prospectus
as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses or entities,
which we refer to throughout this prospectus as a target business. To date, our
efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities
related to this offering. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business
will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we
intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in the information
technology consulting industry. We have not selected any target business for our
initial business combination and we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf),
directly or indirectly, engaged in any substantive discussions with a target
business with respect to a business combination transaction with us.

Our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in the
information technology consulting industry and the staffing industry as
managers, principals, advisors or directors of companies operating in the
information technology consulting industry. They also have extensive experience
in identifying, negotiating with and conducting due diligence on companies
targeted for acquisition and consummating acquisitions in the information
technology consulting industry and the staffing industry. Prior to the
consummation of our initial business combination, we intend to leverage the
industry experience of our executive officers, including their extensive
contacts, relationships and access to acquisition opportunities, by focusing our
efforts on identifying a prospective target business or businesses operating in
the information technology consulting industry, although we will not be limited
to the information technology consulting industry and may consider opportunities
in the staffing industry and other industries. Our management team, however,
does not have prior experience in pursuing acquisitions on behalf of blank check
companies and past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of
success with respect to locating a target business to acquire or any business
combination we may consummate.

We may also seek guidance and advice from special advisors to us, Peter
Underwood, Joseph Raymond and Demetrios Mallios. We have no formal arrangement
or agreement with these advisors to provide services to us and they have no
obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to present business opportunities to us.
These special advisors will provide advice, introductions to potential targets,
and assistance to us, at our request, only if they are able to do so.
Nevertheless, we believe that with their respective business backgrounds and
extensive contacts, these special advisors will be helpful to our search for a
target business and our consummation of a business combination.

Subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination, we believe
that the strengths of our management team, particularly their extensive
operations experience in the information technology consulting industry, will be
valuable to any business in the information technology consulting industry with
which we consummate our initial business combination, although the specific
roles, if any, they may have following our initial business combination cannot
be determined at this time.

We will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to consummate our
initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able
to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months, we may extend
the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by
an additional three months (for a total of up to 24 months to complete a
business combination). Our ability to extend the time available for us to
consummate our initial business combination will be conditioned upon the deposit
by our initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees into the trust
account of $200,000 prior to the applicable deadline for each three month
extension. Our initial stockholders and their affiliates or designees are not
obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our
initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial
business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible
but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding
public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account,
including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek
to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such
amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the
claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and
liquidation, the public warrants and public rights will expire and will be
worthless.

We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination
at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert
their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed
business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our
stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a
tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount
equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the
trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations
described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval
of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares
to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will
be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and
whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek
stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require
stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their
initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash
upon consummation of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not
required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and
allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to the tender offer rules
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. In that case, we will file
tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same
financial and other information about the initial business combination as is
required under the SEC’s proxy rules.

The initial per public share redemption or conversion price will be $10.35 per
share regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised. However, we
may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors
which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an increase in the size of the offering pursuant
to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
Act, could result in the per-share conversion or liquidation price decreasing by
as much as $0.05. Alternatively, our insiders (or their designees) may purchase
from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units that is
necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to $10.35 per share
sold to the public in this offering.

Pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, our initial business
combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate
fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding
any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the
trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business
combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market
value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an
independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such
criteria. We will also obtain a fairness opinion from an independent investment
banking firm before consummating a business combination with an entity
affiliated with any of our officers, directors or insiders.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the
post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or
acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or
businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such
that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such
interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives
of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will
only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or
acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for
it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the
post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities
of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may
collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination
transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a
substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital
stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in
the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new
shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination
could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our
initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or
assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the
post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is
owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets
test. If our business combination is structured in a manner in which we are not
the surviving entity and the target company securities are to be issued to
holders of our securities, the target company will be required to register the
target company securities pursuant to a registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission unless an exemption from registration can be
identified. The registration process, if required, could delay the consummation
of the business combination.

If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination 
opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or
she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be 
required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior 
to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. All of our officers,
directors and director nominees currently have certain relevant pre-existing 
fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.
