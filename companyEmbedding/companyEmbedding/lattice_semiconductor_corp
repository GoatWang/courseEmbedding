History[edit]
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud and Ray Capece.[6] Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini were the early investors in the company.[6] Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board.[6] Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987.[6] The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved into a smaller headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon, from what was then an unincorporated area near Beaverton.[7]
The next year the company posted then record revenues while shrinking from 140 employees to 75 employees after the bankruptcy.[8] Cyrus Tsui became the company's chief executive officer in 1988.[9] On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering.[10] The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million in capital for the company.[10] In July 1990, Lattice raised an additional $22.6 million from a second stock offering, selling nearly 1.5 million new shares at $16.25 per share.[11]
In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices.[12] They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun.[12] Forbes ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996.[13]
In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]
Operations[edit]




Former company headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon


In addition to CPLDs & SPLDs, Lattice also manufactures field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable mixed-signal and interconnect products, related software and intellectual property (IP).[37] Lattice's main products are the ECP and XP series of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), the Mach series of CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices), the ispPAC POWR series of programmable power management products (programmable mixed signal FPAA) and Lattice Diamond design software.[38] At the 90 nm node, Lattice offers a variety of FPGA devices. Products are used in a variety of end uses, such as flat-panel televisions and laptops.[18]
The company is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the high-tech area known as the Silicon Forest.[39] The company employs 700 people worldwide, with approximately 250 of those at company headquarters. Darin Billerbeck is Lattice's chief executive officer and president.[40][41] Its chief competitors are Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi (previously Actel.)[42]

In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]

History[edit]
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud and Ray Capece.[6] Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini were the early investors in the company.[6] Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board.[6] Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987.[6] The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved into a smaller headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon, from what was then an unincorporated area near Beaverton.[7]
The next year the company posted then record revenues while shrinking from 140 employees to 75 employees after the bankruptcy.[8] Cyrus Tsui became the company's chief executive officer in 1988.[9] On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering.[10] The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million in capital for the company.[10] In July 1990, Lattice raised an additional $22.6 million from a second stock offering, selling nearly 1.5 million new shares at $16.25 per share.[11]
In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices.[12] They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun.[12] Forbes ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996.[13]
In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]

History[edit]
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud and Ray Capece.[6] Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini were the early investors in the company.[6] Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board.[6] Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987.[6] The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved into a smaller headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon, from what was then an unincorporated area near Beaverton.[7]
The next year the company posted then record revenues while shrinking from 140 employees to 75 employees after the bankruptcy.[8] Cyrus Tsui became the company's chief executive officer in 1988.[9] On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering.[10] The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million in capital for the company.[10] In July 1990, Lattice raised an additional $22.6 million from a second stock offering, selling nearly 1.5 million new shares at $16.25 per share.[11]
In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices.[12] They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun.[12] Forbes ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996.[13]
In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]
Operations[edit]




Former company headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon


In addition to CPLDs & SPLDs, Lattice also manufactures field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable mixed-signal and interconnect products, related software and intellectual property (IP).[37] Lattice's main products are the ECP and XP series of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), the Mach series of CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices), the ispPAC POWR series of programmable power management products (programmable mixed signal FPAA) and Lattice Diamond design software.[38] At the 90 nm node, Lattice offers a variety of FPGA devices. Products are used in a variety of end uses, such as flat-panel televisions and laptops.[18]
The company is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the high-tech area known as the Silicon Forest.[39] The company employs 700 people worldwide, with approximately 250 of those at company headquarters. Darin Billerbeck is Lattice's chief executive officer and president.[40][41] Its chief competitors are Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi (previously Actel.)[42]

History[edit]
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud and Ray Capece.[6] Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini were the early investors in the company.[6] Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board.[6] Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987.[6] The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved into a smaller headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon, from what was then an unincorporated area near Beaverton.[7]
The next year the company posted then record revenues while shrinking from 140 employees to 75 employees after the bankruptcy.[8] Cyrus Tsui became the company's chief executive officer in 1988.[9] On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering.[10] The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million in capital for the company.[10] In July 1990, Lattice raised an additional $22.6 million from a second stock offering, selling nearly 1.5 million new shares at $16.25 per share.[11]
In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices.[12] They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun.[12] Forbes ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996.[13]
In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]
Operations[edit]




Former company headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon


In addition to CPLDs & SPLDs, Lattice also manufactures field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable mixed-signal and interconnect products, related software and intellectual property (IP).[37] Lattice's main products are the ECP and XP series of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), the Mach series of CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices), the ispPAC POWR series of programmable power management products (programmable mixed signal FPAA) and Lattice Diamond design software.[38] At the 90 nm node, Lattice offers a variety of FPGA devices. Products are used in a variety of end uses, such as flat-panel televisions and laptops.[18]
The company is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the high-tech area known as the Silicon Forest.[39] The company employs 700 people worldwide, with approximately 250 of those at company headquarters. Darin Billerbeck is Lattice's chief executive officer and president.[40][41] Its chief competitors are Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi (previously Actel.)[42]

History[edit]
Lattice was founded on April 3, 1983, by C. Norman Winningstad, Rahul Sud and Ray Capece.[6] Winningstad, Harry Merlo, Tom Moyer, and John Piacentini were the early investors in the company.[6] Co-founder Sud left as president in December 1986, and Winningstad left in 1991 as chairman of the board.[6] Lattice was incorporated in Oregon in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985. Early struggles led to chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in July 1987.[6] The company emerged from bankruptcy after 62 days and moved into a smaller headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon, from what was then an unincorporated area near Beaverton.[7]
The next year the company posted then record revenues while shrinking from 140 employees to 75 employees after the bankruptcy.[8] Cyrus Tsui became the company's chief executive officer in 1988.[9] On November 9, 1989, Lattice became a publicly traded company when its shares were listed on the NASDAQ after in initial public offering.[10] The initial share price was $6, and raised almost $14 million in capital for the company.[10] In July 1990, Lattice raised an additional $22.6 million from a second stock offering, selling nearly 1.5 million new shares at $16.25 per share.[11]
In 1995, the company attempted to assert trademark rights in the term Silicon Forest beyond the use of its trademark for the use in semiconductor devices.[12] They had registered the mark in 1985, but later conceded they could not prevent the usage of the term as a noun.[12] Forbes ranked the company as their 162nd best small company in the United States in 1996.[13]
In 1996, Lattice began expansions at its Hillsboro, Oregon, headquarters to double the size of the facility.[9] The company grew to annual revenues of more than $560 million and profits in excess of $160 million in 2000.[14] Its stock price reached an all-time high that year of $41.34 per share, as adjusted for stock splits.[14] Lattice purchased Agere Corporation's FPGA division in 2002.[15] Steve Skaggs was hired as CEO in 2005, replacing Cyrus Tsui.[15] That year, Lattice had layoffs for the first time in company history.[15] For fiscal year 2006, Lattice posted a profit of $3.1 million on revenues of $245.5 million, this was the first annual profit for the company since 2000.[16]
In 2004, the company settled charges with the United States government that it had illegally exported certain technologies to China, paying a fine of $560,000.[17] In June 2008, Bruno Guilmart was named as chief executive officer of the company, replacing Steve Skaggs.[18] For fiscal year 2008, Lattice had a loss of $32 million on annual revenues of $222.3 million.[19] In 2009, the company began moving all of its warehouse operations for parts from Oregon to Singapore.[20] Through July 2009, the company had lost money for ten straight quarters,[21] and had its first profitable quarter in three years during the fourth quarter of 2009.[22] Bruno Guilmart left the company in August 2010, and Darin Billerbeck who just sold Zilog in last year, was named the new CEO in October of that year, starting in November.[23] The company reported 2011 revenue of $318 million.[24] For the first quarter of 2012 Lattice reported revenue of $71.7 million.[25] Lattice reported revenue of $70.8 million for the second quarter of 2012.[26] Lattice started a stock buy-back program in 2010 that continued into 2012 that would total about $35 million if fully implemented.[27]
On December 9, 2011, Lattice announced it was acquiring SiliconBlue for $63.2 million in cash.[28][29][30] Lattice announced in July 2012 a foundry agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation. In October 2012, the company announced third quarter revenue of $70.9 million and restructuring that included job lay-offs.[31] Lattice returned to profitability in 2013 with a profit of $22.3 million on $332.5 million in revenues.[32] The company acquired Silicon Image Inc. for $606 million in March 2015[33] and moved company headquarters to Downtown Portland.[34]
In April 2016, Tsinghua Holdings said in a U.S. filing that it accumulated a roughly 6 percent stake in Lattice Semiconductor through share purchased on the open market.[35] In November, 2016, Canyon Bridge Capital Partners announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of Lattice's shares.[36]
Operations[edit]




Former company headquarters in Hillsboro, Oregon


In addition to CPLDs & SPLDs, Lattice also manufactures field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable mixed-signal and interconnect products, related software and intellectual property (IP).[37] Lattice's main products are the ECP and XP series of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), the Mach series of CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices), the ispPAC POWR series of programmable power management products (programmable mixed signal FPAA) and Lattice Diamond design software.[38] At the 90 nm node, Lattice offers a variety of FPGA devices. Products are used in a variety of end uses, such as flat-panel televisions and laptops.[18]
The company is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the high-tech area known as the Silicon Forest.[39] The company employs 700 people worldwide, with approximately 250 of those at company headquarters. Darin Billerbeck is Lattice's chief executive officer and president.[40][41] Its chief competitors are Xilinx, Altera and Microsemi (previously Actel.)[42]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
