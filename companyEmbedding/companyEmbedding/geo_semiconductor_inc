GainSpan and Partners Introduce Video Doorbell Reference Design
May 19 16
GainSpan Corporation, GEO Semiconductor Inc. and ON Semiconductor Corporation, has introduced a low-power, battery-operated video doorbell reference design capable of streaming high definition, or HD, video and two-way, telephony quality audio over Wi-Fi networks. Developed in response to the rapidly growing IoT market for video/audio streaming products in the home, the reference design platform speeds time to market and reduces product development cost and cycle times for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Through this partnership, customers benefit from the leadership each company has shown in its respective field: GEO Semiconductor's low power, highly integrated video encoder solutions, ON Semiconductor's image sensor solutions and GainSpan's expertise in low-power, cloud-connected Wi-Fi solutions. The solution features GEO's power-efficient MAX64380 video compression chip and ON Semiconductor's AR0330 CMOS image sensor integrated with GainSpan's GS2011M low power, Wi-Fi module on a small printed circuit board. The GainSpan GS2011M serves as the system host controller, running embedded streaming protocols and application software, also developed by GainSpan. The platform delivers crisp 1080p (1920x1080) HD video at 30 frames per second and utilizes the MAX64380's internal audio processing features to deliver high quality, full duplex voice audio with on-board acoustic echo cancellation and noise reduction. The platform is an ideal, low power and cost-effective reference design for internet-connected video doorbell and smart camera products. The platform's wireless connectivity features and software enable video and audio streaming directly to smartphones that use either iOS or Android operating systems or through cloud connections. The solution comprises hardware and software needed for engineers to quickly and simply add video and audio streaming capabilities into their IoT-based product designs, thereby reducing development costs and accelerating time to market. The GS-ADK-Video+FD Audio-1080p ADK is accompanied by a complete software suite, plus a series of sophisticated mobile Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and mobile demo applications for Android and iOS devices. The ADK is available through GainSpan and its distributors. Central to this solution is ON Semiconductor's AR0330 1/3-Inch optical format CMOS image sensor, which delivers superior imaging quality in low light conditions. Using its 2304 x 1296 active-pixel array, this device has the capacity to capture 3 megapixel (MP) still images. It also incorporates advanced on-chip camera features, such as column/row subsampling, windowing, mirroring and snapshot modes.


Edimax Chooses GEO Semiconductor Inc. for Smallest Fisheye Camera
Jan 7 16
GEO Semiconductor Inc. announced that the GEO GC6500 camera processor has been selected to power Edimax’s smallest Fisheye camera. GEO’s GC6500 camera processor integrates its patented eWARP® core. This fully programmable geometry processing engine de-warps wide angle field of views, adjusts perspective and rotational misalignment in real time. The GC6500 also integrates GEO’s patented H.264 and MJPEG compression engines that support resolutions up to 5 Megapixel with full HD, 1080p60 output. The GC6500 supports multi-streaming protocols that deliver the high quality output by adapting resolution and frame rate to network bandwidth. The smallest fisheye camera can fully replace current mechanical PTZ cameras to avoid motor repair concerns. Edimax has developed an iOS/Android APP, which supports a rich user experience. The APP supports Fisheye view, Panoramic View, ePTZ (Electronic Pan Tilt and Zoom) as well as patrol mode for NVR applications. This camera also supports D-MIC for good voice recording quality.
