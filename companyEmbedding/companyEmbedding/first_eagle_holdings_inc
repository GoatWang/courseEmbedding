Focus on Absolute Returns
We attempt to avoid the permanent impairment of capital and generate long-term positive absolute returns across market cycles. >






Flexible, Benchmark-Agnostic Approach
The Fund has the ability to invest across asset classes, regions, sectors/industries and market-capitalization ranges -- without regard to a benchmark. >






Seeks To Provide Downside Protection
Our attempts to avoid the permanent loss of capital result in a portfolio that has exposure to equities purchased with what we believe to be a margin of safety in price. >

Ratings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

Investment Philosophy

The Global Fund’s philosophy reflects the teachings of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett: We believe there is a persistent market failure to recognize a company's intrinsic value. The Fund attempts to exploit this failure on behalf of our investors through a bottom-up, fundamental investment approach.
 




Fund Management





 
 

Matthew McLennan CFA Portfolio Manager Industry Experience: 25 yrs

 


 
 

Kimball Brooker Jr.  Portfolio Manager Industry Experience: 24 yrs

 

 




Investment Process

The fundamental research process has remained constant since the inception of the Fund. The Fund looks for opportunities in companies that have temporarily disappointed investors; industries in turmoil or out of favor; and countries in economic downturns or overlooked by the market.
The investment process involves the following steps:

1

Analyze, Understand Business Models
Thoroughly understand a company and the market in which it operates. Among other critical factors, the team's document-driven analysis examines:

A company's market share
The nature of its products and its business contingencies



2

Recast Financial Statements
Financial statements are recast because:

Conservative accounting practices can mask the true earnings power of a company
In our view, accounting practices are sometimes too liberal

Our goal is to uncover a company's true economic earnings using only demonstrated results.


3

Calculate Intrinsic Value
The team places great emphasis on:

Balance sheet valuation (such as Enterprise Value to Asset Replacement Value)
Cash flow valuation (such as EV/EBIT)

Investments are made based on significant discounts to what is believed to be a company's intrinsic value.


4

Typically Invest for the Long Term
The team typically seeks a discount to what they believe is a company's intrinsic value

They seek further protection by determining a margin of safety in each holding
This margin of safety is viewed as a form of protection against uncertainty in a fundamentally unknowable future.




The Global Fund may also invest in non-equity securities in an attempt to help preserve purchasing power. These include:

Gold bullion
Corporate bonds (senior or subordinated bonds, convertible bonds)
Cash and cash equivalents (commercial paper)
 






There are risks associated with investing in securities of foreign countries, such as erratic market conditions, economic and political instability and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These risks may be more pronounced with respect to investments in emerging markets.


The principal risk of investing in value stocks is that the price of the security may not approach its anticipated value or may decline in value.


Investment in gold and gold related investments present certain risks, and returns on gold related investments have traditionally been more volatile than investments in broader equity or debt markets.


All investments involve the risk of loss of principal.

 

















The following information describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Global Fund.
Please read prospectus carefully for more complete information including details on fees, expenses and risks before investing.
 













 






* A contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% may be imposed on certain redemptions of Class A shares made within 18 months following a purchase of $1,000,000 or more without an initial sales charge.


**"Other Expenses" shown reflect actual expenses for the Fund for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 and estimated expenses in the case of newly organized share classes.


Class I Shares require $1mm minimum investment, and are offered without sales charge.


There are several ways to lower the sales charge on Class A shares: Aggregation, Rights of Accumulation and Letter of Intention. For details please refer to our prospectus.
In order to claim a breakpoint or other means of reducing the sales charge, an investor should notify his or her dealer, the Distributor, or the Transfer Agent (DST) at the time of purchase.

 

























 






Ordinary income distributions are distributed at the class level and will vary by class.


Collectibles gains, such as gains from gold bullion, held for greater than one year currently are subject to a 28% tax rate. Collectibles gains held for less than one year are taxable to U.S. shareholders as short-term gains.


"Reinvested at" is the share price used to calculate the number of shares added to an account if a shareholder reinvests dividends or capital gains.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
