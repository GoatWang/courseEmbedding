Profile


Profile

Ken Julian represents companies and individuals in civil and criminal trials and governmental investigations. Colleagues have described him as a “detail-oriented and relentless” fighter who “understands the subtle art of the destructive cross-examination” (Daily Journal). Ken has developed a reputation as a “cagey courtroom strategist” with a “quick mind,” a “gentlemanly demeanor” and “devastating cross-examination skills” (OC Weekly).
Ken has prevailed at trial in a variety of civil and criminal matters. His victories include winning a full acquittal for the director of the liver transplant program at St. Vincent Medical Center (“Doctor Acquitted of Coverup in Misallocated Liver Transplant,” Los Angeles Times); defeating a $100 million false claims act investigation on behalf of a global medical device maker; and obtaining dismissal of a 300-count indictment in a high-profile fraud prosecution (“Massive ‘Robo-Signing’ Prosecution Dismissed for Misconduct,” The National Law Journal).
Before joining Manatt, Ken was a deputy chief in the Orange County office of the U.S. Attorney, where he successfully prosecuted Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona in the “highest-profile trial in the history of Orange County’s federal court” (The Orange County Register). During that trial, he “massacre[d]” a key defense witness with a “cross-examination [that] could be used in law school” (“The New Math on How Many Mike Carona Campaign Contributors Got Badges,” OC Weekly).
Ken served for more than 11 years as a federal prosecutor in the Central and Eastern Districts of California, “convicting fraudulent surgery centers, telemarketing businesses and real estate swindlers as well as participating in the investigations into Broadcom billionaire Henry Nicholas, the Samantha Runnion kidnapping/murder and the Mongols Motorcycle Gang.” (“Sheriff Mike Carona Prosecutor Leaves Department of Justice,” OC Weekly).






Experience


Experience
White Collar Criminal Defense: Representative Matters
Acquittal on All Counts: After a three-week federal jury trial, Ken won an acquittal on all counts for the former director of the liver transplant program at St. Vincent Medical Center, who was charged with making false statements and falsifying records within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“Doctor on Trial: Anatomy of an Acquittal,” The National Law Journal).
Fraud Indictment Dismissed: Ken secured the dismissal of a 300-count indictment in a high-profile “robo-signing” prosecution brought by the Nevada Attorney General’s Office, which charged a corporate officer with notarization-related crimes arising out of the foreclosure crisis (“Massive ‘Robo-Signing’ Prosecution Dismissed for Misconduct,” The National Law Journal).
Antitrust Leniency Request Granted: On the eve of trial, in a criminal antitrust price-fixing prosecution, Ken won an evidentiary ruling on behalf of a Taiwanese auto lights manufacturer, excluding the government’s key evidence from trial. After this ruling, the government reversed its previous denial of the manufacturer’s application under the Antitrust Division’s Leniency Program (“Feds OK Eagle Eyes Leniency Request in Price-Fixing Case,” Law360).
Felony Counts Dismissed: After winning discovery battles against Fortune 500 technology companies, Ken obtained a rare misdemeanor disposition for a corporate executive charged in a $20 million federal mail and wire fraud prosecution involving the resale of gray market computer products.
Deferred Prosecution in FDA Matter: Ken obtained a deferred prosecution agreement on behalf of a global shipping company accused of criminal violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, calling for the dismissal of all criminal charges upon the successful completion of a compliance program.
Environmental Charges Dismissed: While Ken served as lead trial counsel, on the eve of trial, the government dismissed all charges against a business entity charged with criminal violations of federal environmental laws.
New Trial Motion Granted: Ken was hired post-trial by a real estate executive convicted of 34 felony counts in an alleged real estate fraud scheme. The court granted a new trial motion on behalf of Ken’s client.
Corporate Investigations: Representative Matters
FCA Investigation Defeated: On behalf of a global medical device manufacturer, Ken secured a declination from the U.S. Department of Justice in a False Claims Act investigation of allegations that the company’s alleged failure to comply with FDA regulations caused over $100 million in false claims to be submitted to government health insurance programs.
FCA Allegations Shown Unfounded: On behalf of a national health insurer, Ken conducted an internal investigation regarding a whistleblower’s allegations that the insurer’s failure to comply with CMS regulations resulted in the submission of false claims; the allegations were shown to be unfounded.
Accounting Irregularities Proved Groundless: On behalf of a publicly traded health insurer, Ken conducted an internal investigation that proved groundless a whistleblower’s complaints regarding alleged accounting irregularities.
Executive Misconduct Documented: On behalf of an entertainment industry client, Ken investigated and documented financial misconduct by a chief executive officer.
Business Litigation: Representative Matters
Insurance Bad Faith Victory: Ken won a partial summary judgment on the tort of bad faith against an insurer, and prevailed on contract claims after a two-week jury trial, resulting in a multimillion-dollar settlement.
Defense Verdict: Ken secured a defense verdict in a bench trial on behalf of a public official accused of causing waste and misuse of public funds.
Contract Action Resolved: Ken defended a major healthcare company in a multimillion-dollar breach of contract and fraud action. He successfully compelled arbitration and settled the matter on favorable terms.
