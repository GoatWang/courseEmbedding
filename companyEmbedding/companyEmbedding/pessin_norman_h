View full sizeBeth Nakamura / The OregonianNautilus, Inc., last fall introduced a new product, the CoreBody Reformer.A New York investor has purchased 1.5 million shares of Nautilus Inc. stock for about $3.1 million, giving him a 4.9 percent ownership stake in the Vancouver exercise equipment company, according to a regulatory filing. 
Norman H. Pessin paid $2.09 a share, though the Securities and Exchange Filing issued last week does not say what day the purchase took place. 
Nautilus stock has ranged from $1.32 to $3.45 over the past year, and closed Wednesday at $2.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The same filing says Sandra F. Pessin purchased 200,700 shares, or 0.6 percent, of stock for $326,480, or $1.62 per share. 
"They follow the company and have been very interested and supportive," Nautilus chief executive Bruce Cazenave said of the Pessins, husband and wife. "We view it as a positive." 
Norman Pessin, according to the investing industry website citybizlist.com, was a principal for nearly 25 years at Neuberger Berman, a New York asset management firm. 
"Pessin is currently a private investor with a focus on small, publicly traded companies," the website says. "At Neuberger Berman, Pessin was responsible for syndicate underwriting, prime brokerage, correspondent clearing and Nasdaq market-making. He also served on the Board of Governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers and was a director of the Nasdaq Stock Market." 
Nautilus has said it will report fourth-quarter earnings in mid March.
