Consensus Ratings for Perk (TSE:PER) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: C$6.50

OVERVIEW



Building upon our clients' relationships with our estate and tax planning partners, Perkins Coie Trust Company provides a unique opportunity to coordinate clients' legal, estate planning, trust, investment management and financial planning needs.
Whatever the nature of our clients' wealth – the sale of a business, exercise of stock options, an inheritance, or rollover from a retirement plan – our professionals help implement customized strategies for each client's particular circumstances, goals and outlook. We work with our clients to ensure that their estate planning goals are properly implemented during the settlement of the estate and beyond.
We deliver services in three primary areas—administration of trusts and estates, investment management of personal assets including IRAs, and financial planning. Our professionals, with an average of 25 years of experience, provide a distinctive caliber of personalized service and knowledge in these areas.

We provide a wide spectrum of flexible services in our primary duty to deliver personal, attentive care to beneficiaries of trusts and to ensure that estates are settled in accordance with the will.
Investment Advisory Services

We also serve as an investment advisory agent to individuals who are trustees. We develop customized strategies for each client and apply a highly disciplined investment process to meet financial objectives.

?

The meta description for perkinscoie.com is missing.Meta descriptions allow you to influence how your web pages are described and displayed in search results. A good description acts as a potential organic advertisement and encourages the viewer to click through to your site.Keep it short and to the point; the ideal meta description should be between 70 and 160 characters (spaces included).Ensure that each of your web pages have a unique meta description that is explicit and contains your most important keywords for each page. These keywords are especially important because they appear in bold when they match the user’s search query (See the Google Preview below).Check your Google Search Console (Search Appearance > HTML Improvements) for any warning messages to identify meta descriptions that are too long/short or duplicated across more than one page.

Improve the Meta Description

HTML header tags (or simply header tags) differentiate between headings, subheadings and the rest of the content on the page.Your website either does not currently use HTML header tags or is using too many. Use keywords in your headings with your most important keywords in the top level and be sure to maintain the <H1> to <H6> hierarchy.While it is important to ensure every page has an <H1> tag, only include more than one per page if you're using HTML5. Instead, use multiple <H2> - <H6> tags.

Add the important keywords in <H> headings

Keyword consistency is the use of keywords throughout the different elements of the webpage. Consistent keyword use helps crawlers index your site and determine relevancy to search queries.The table above highlights the most frequently used keywords on your page and how consistently you're using them.

Be more consistent with your keywords






















                                      Alt Attribute

Easy to solve





      We found 8 images on this web page.
      
    

      No ALT attributes are empty or missing.
      
    


?

Alternative text allows you to add a description to an image. Since search engine crawlers cannot see images, they rely on alternative text attributes to determine relevance to a search query. Alternative text also helps makes an image more likely to appear in a Google image search and is used by screen readers to provide context for visually impaired users.It looks like most or all of your images have alternative text. Check the images on your website to make sure accurate and relevant alternative text is specified for each image on the page. Try to minimize the number of alt text characters to 150 or less (including spaces!) to optimize page load times.

Set a name for all your images

Links pass value from one page to another. This value is called 'link juice'.A page's link juice is split between all the links on that page so lots of unnecessary links on a page will dilute the value attributed to each link. There's no exact number of links to include on a page but best practice is to keep it under 200.Using the Nofollow attribute in your links prevents some link juice, but these links are still taken into account when calculating the value that is passed through each link, so using lots of NoFollow links can still dilute PageRank.

      Great, a redirect is in place to redirect traffic from your non-preferred domain.
      
    


?

Search engines see www.trust.perkinscoie.com and trust.perkinscoie.com as different websites. This means they could see a large amount of duplicate content, which they don't like.Fortunately your website redirects www.trust.perkinscoie.com and  trust.perkinscoie.com to the same site.

https://trust.perkinscoie.com/robots.txt



?

A robots.txt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine crawlers to prevent them from accessing specific pages or directories. They also point the web crawler to your page’s XML sitemap file.Your site currently has a robot.txt file. You can use Google Search Console's Robots.txt Tester to submit and test your robot.txt file and to make sure Googlebot isn't crawling any restricted files.

We checked perkinscoie.com but couldn't find an XML sitemap.XML sitemaps contain the list of your URLs that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently. They can also include information like your site’s latest updates, frequency of changes and the importance of URLs.Your site is currently missing an XML sitemap. We recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Normally, your XML sitemap would be found at perkinscoie.com/sitemap.Make sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl, so leave out any that have been blocked in a robots.txt file. Avoid using any URLs that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred URLs (with or without www.), correct protocols (http vs. https) and trailing slashes. You should also use your robots.txt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap.

Add and Optimize your XML sitemap






















                                      URL Parameters
                                    







      Good, the URLs look clean.
      
    


?

                                    URL parameters are used to track user behaviors on site (session IDs), traffic sources (referrer IDs) or to give users control over the content on the page (sorting and filtering). The issue with URL parameters is that Google sees each unique parameter value as a new URL hosting the same thing - meaning you could have a duplicate content problem. Sometimes, it’s able to recognize these URLs and group them together. It then algorithmically decides which URL is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results. You can help Google recognize the best URL by using the rel=”canonical” tag.Use the URL Parameters Tool in Google Search Console to tell Google how your URL parameters affect page content and how to to crawl URLs with parameters. Use this tool very carefully - you can easily prevent Google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings, especially if you have URLs with multiple parameters.
                                    
                                
Rewrite your URLs and clean them up.






















                                      Underscores in the URLs

      Great, you are not using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs.
      
    


?

Great, you aren't using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs. Google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores aren't recognized. So the search engine sees www.example.com/green_dress as www.example.com/greendress. The bots will have a hard time determining this URL's relevance to a keyword.

Flash: No







Frames: No



?

Great, you aren't using Flash or frames on your site.While it often looks nicer, Flash content can't be properly indexed by search engines. Maximize your SEO efforts by avoiding Flash.Search engines also have problems with frames because they can't crawl or index the content within them. Avoid them if you can and use a NoFrames tag when you can't.

Keep your URLs short and clean and avoid long domain names when possible.A descriptive URL is better recognized by search engines. A user should be able to look at the address bar and make an accurate guess about the content of the page before reaching it (e.g., http://www.mysite.com/en/products).Keep in mind that URLs are also an important part of a comprehensive SEO strategy. Use clean URLs to make your site more "crawlable" by Google™.Resource: Search for a good domain name. If no good names are available, consider a second hand domain. To prevent brand theft, you might consider trademarking your domain name.

                                    Modern websites tend to be SSL secured (HTTPS) as it provides an extra security layer while logging in to your Web Service. In 2014, Google announced that an HTTPS (vs HTTP) website would receive an extra boost in their ranking. While switching to HTTPS, make sure your site remains optimized and see to it that your website will still run quickly. Follow these best practices for a smooth transition:Use a serious issuer to purchase your SSL certificateRedirect all of your HTTP pages to the HTTPS version of your websiteUse HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in your headersRenew your SSL certificate every year, before it expiresMake sure that all of your content (CSS, etc.) is linked to HTTPSUpdate your XML sitemap to ensure the URLs include HTTPS and update the robots.txt file to reference this versionRegister the HTTPS website in Google & Bing Search Console/Webmaster Tools
