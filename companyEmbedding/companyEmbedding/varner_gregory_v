Registration of ‘samurai’ otebo bean

Abstract
‘Samurai’ otebo bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (Reg. No. CV-312, PI 676022), developed by Michigan State University AgBioResearch, was released in 2015 as an upright, full-season cultivar with virus (caused by Bean common mosaic virus) resistance and high yield potential. Samurai was developed using pedigree breeding method to the F6 generation followed by pure line selection for disease, agronomic, and quality traits. In 3 yr of field trials, Samurai yielded 2828 kg ha-1, flowered in 45 d, and matured in 100 d on average. Plants averaged 52 cm in height, with lodging resistance score of 1.6 and seed weight of 28.1 g 100 seed-1. Samurai combines high yield potential with erect architecture with full-season maturity in an otebo seed type. Samurai has resistance to lodging and high pod placement within plant structure, making it suitable for direct harvest under narrow-row production systems. Current otebo cultivars are short-statured plants with determinate growth habit that require traditional pulling equipment due to the excessive seed loss that would result from direct harvest. Samurai is susceptible to race 73 of anthracnose [caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. & Magnus) Lams.-Scrib], susceptible to rust race 22:2 [caused by Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.:Pers.) Unger], and hypersensitive resistant to strain NL 3 of Bean common mosaic necrosis virus. Samurai otebo bean seed differs from other white-seeded navy and great northern cultivars in possessing low levels of resistant starch, which makes it better suited for paste rather than canned bean products that meet industry standards.
