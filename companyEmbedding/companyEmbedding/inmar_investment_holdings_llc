Advisor to Inmar







Peter S. Fader
Frances and Pei-Yuan Chia Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School of the University Of Pennsylvania
Peter’s expertise centers on the use of behavioral data to understand and forecast customer shopping/purchasing activities across a wide range of industries such as consumer packaged goods, interactive media, financial services and pharmaceuticals. Managerial applications focus on topics such as customer relationship management, lifetime value of the customer, and sales forecasting for new products. Much of his research highlights the consistent (but often surprising) behavioral patterns that exist across these industries and other seemingly different domains.
Many of these cross-industry experiences led to the development of the Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative, a research center that serves as a “matchmaker” between leading-edge academic researchers and top companies that depend on granular, customer-level data for key strategic decisions. Peter co-directs the center and his work has been published in (and he serves on the editorial boards of) a number of leading journals in marketing, statistics and the management sciences. He has won numerous awards for his teaching and research accomplishments.
Peter holds a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management.
