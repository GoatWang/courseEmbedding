2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Investments/Insurance: Not FDIC Insured • Not Bank Issued, Guaranteed or Underwritten • May Lose Value



Morningstar® is an independent service that rates mutual funds and other types of investments. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.



Automatic investment plans don't assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.



Asset allocation funds may change portfolio holding allocations on a frequent basis, resulting in high portfolio turnover and more brokerage commissions from an increased amount of the purchasing and selling of securities. The Fund may have a higher proportion of capital gains and a potentially lower return than a fund that does not have a reallocation policy.

(known as USAA Financial Insurance Agency in California, License #0E36312), a registered investment adviser and insurance agency and its wholly owned subsidiary, USAA Financial Advisors, Inc., a registered broker dealer.



Lipper, Inc. is a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters. The Lipper Fund Awards program honors funds that have excelled in delivering consistently, strong risk-adjusted performance relative to its peers.

Generally, portfolios containing ETFs will have lower expense ratios (compared to mutual funds) that could lead to lowering your overall costs. However, cost is only one of many factors to consider when investing.

A rollover is a way to move your retirement money from one account to another without triggering current taxes or penalties.This allows you to take money from an employer retirement plan -- such as a 401(k), 403(b) or a thrift savings plan — and put it into an IRA, which stands for individual retirement account.2 Kinds of Rollovers  43 Seconds[00:43]If you decide a rollover is right for you, there are two kinds of rollovers: direct and indirect.With a direct rollover, your employer's retirement plan sends a check payable to USAA.With an indirect rollover, the check is made payable to you and could come with some tax implications.You can learn more about how to start a rollover on this page.Transfers  0 minutes, 00 seconds[01:06]But what if your retirement money isn't in an employer retirement plan?That's where transfers come in.A transfer is a move of an investment account from one financial institution to another.Before You Act  1 minutes, 17 seconds[01:17]There are many things to think about before rolling over or transferring your account, including potential considerations for sticking with your current plan…Potential considerations for sticking with your employer plan: lower costs, employer match, delayed Required Minimum Distributions, loan options and stronger creditor protection.Or considerations for moving your money.Potential considerations for rolling over your plan: opportunity for professional advice and service, consolidated retirement assets may be easier to manage and may have more flexibility and greater selection of investments with an IRA.You can read more about rollovers and transfers…or even open your account on this page today.End  1 minutes, 39 seconds[01:39]Important Legal InformationThe law concerning tax and retirement plans is complex and USAA and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Please consult your tax and legal advisors regarding your specific situation to help determine next steps.Other options are available besides rolling over your employer-sponsored retirement plan, and an employer-sponsored retirement plan can offer advantages investors can't get if they roll the money into an IRA.Prior to requesting an IRA rollover from a qualified retirement plan account, consider whether such rollover is appropriate for you. Although IRA rollovers may have certain advantages, qualified retirement plan accounts have advantages you should consider before proceeding which may include, but are not limited to, low administrative and investment expenses and, if you separate from service at age 55 or older, you have penalty-free access to your qualified retirement plan account funds. Additionally, you may want to consider maintaining at least a minimal qualified retirement plan account balance because, in the event you want to transfer or rollover qualified assets to your qualified retirement plan account in the future, to the extent it is allowed by your plan, your plan may require you to have an open account with a balance when your request is received by that plan. You should consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation to determine whether a qualified retirement plan account rollover to an IRA would be suitable for you.Prior to requesting an IRA rollover from a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, which is a retirement plan for military or civilian employees of the U.S. government, consider whether such rollover is appropriate for you. Although IRA rollovers may have certain advantages, TSP accounts have advantages you should consider before proceeding which include, but are not limited to, low administrative and investment expenses and, if you separate from government service at age 55 or older, you have penalty-free access to your TSP account funds.

You should consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation to determine whether a TSP rollover to an IRA would be suitable for you.Withdrawals from an IRA made prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. If you receive a check made payable to you, your former employer is generally required to withhold 20% of the total amount. When you deposit the check into your IRA, you must make up that percentage from your own resources if you wish to avoid being taxed on the withheld amount. At tax time, you can apply to get the withheld 20% back, but it could be a long way off. A better approach is usually to roll the money over directly without ever receiving it.USAA means United Services Automobile Association and its affiliates.237406-0117Close TranscriptWant to learn more about Rollovers and Transfers?

Here's How a Rollover WorksA rollover is a way to move money — without paying taxes or penalties — from an employer-sponsored or other qualified retirement plan such as a 401(k), 403(b), 457 into an IRA account.Steps to a RolloverStep 1: Create your accountOpen an IRA and select "Rollover" as the funding source.Step 2: Print the instructionsPrint the 401(k) rollover instructions (PDF).Step 3: Move rollover to USAAYour former employer will typically have forms for you to complete.Step 4: Check your accountYou'll be able to view your account activity on usaa.com or our free app.About RolloversA rollover provides:Tax advantages: Your rollover is basically just a continuation of your tax-deferred retirement account from your previous job. You don't pay taxes on it if your designated retirement money is not cashed out immediately.Investment options: A rollover IRA allows you to select from a greater amount of investment options, some of the options includes stocks, bonds, CDs, annuities and a larger selection of mutual funds. There also are several options for retirement income and distribution.Ease: Rolling over previous retirement accounts into one IRA may help simplify your finances.Things to Consider With a RolloverBefore you roll over an employer's retirement plan, such as a 401(k) or a 403(b), into an IRA, think about whether it's the right move for you. Both types of plans have their advantages.Possible Benefits for Sticking With Your Employer's PlanEmployer retirement plans have potentially lower costs.Your employer might offer matching funds.You might be able to make penalty-free withdrawals as soon as you reach the age of 55.If you're employed at age 70½, you don't have to make required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a 401(k). Other plans require RMDs starting at age 70½.You could have the option of making pre- or post-tax contributions.You can take out a loan against part of your balance in some cases.Your plan is possibly protected from creditors and any legal judgments against you. Check your retirement plan outline to find the details of your plan.Potential Benefits of Rolling Over Your PlanProfessional advice and service could be more available with an IRA.Keeping track of a number of retirement plans can be complex or unmanageable, while having a single retirement plan may be more streamlined and easier to manage.You'll likely have more flexibility and a greater selection of investments with an IRA. Consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation.Note: Only one IRA to IRA rollover is allowed in a 12-month period, no matter how many IRAs you own.1What's the Difference Between a Direct Rollover and an Indirect Rollover?Direct RolloverThis is a direct transfer of funds or a check made out to USAA from your former employer's retirement plan. There are no fees or taxes for this transaction.Indirect RolloverAn indirect rollover is a distribution (typically a check) made payable to you from your former employer's retirement plan that you deposit to an IRA or another retirement plan qualified to receive rollovers. After you receive your distribution, you have 60 calendar days to deposit the money into the IRA or other retirement arrangement. Because the money is sent to you, your former employer's plan must withhold 20% of your plan proceeds. This means you'll receive only 80% of your distribution amount. To keep the distribution (including the 20% withholding amount) tax free, you must still deposit the full 100% into IRA by adding the missing 20% when you make your rollover deposit. Typically, that 20% which was previously withheld from the distribution will either be applied to taxes you owe or returned to you directly from the IRS when you file your tax return. Please consult your tax advisor about your specific situation.Here's How a TSP Rollover WorksIf you were in the military or a civilian employee of the U.S government, you can use your retirement Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to fund a USAA IRA.Steps to a RolloverStep 1: Create your accountOpen an IRA and select "Rollover" as the funding source.Step 2: Complete the TSP formsDownload and complete rollover forms from the TSP website. The most commonly used form for full withdrawals is the TSP-70 form and the TSP-77 for partial withdrawals.Step 3: We take care of the restAfter completing the TSP Rollover forms, USAA needs to complete some portions of the form. They can be mailed, sent via member message or faxed to 800-292-8177.Things to Consider: Thrift Savings Plan, Traditional and Roth IRAs USAA Savings and USAA Performance First DetailsThrift Savings PlanTraditional IRARoth IRAInvestment Options10 funds with low fees based on well-known stock indexes or lifecycle funds based on your anticipated retirement date.Many investment choices, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds.Many investment choices, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds.WithdrawalsPenalty-free (but subject to tax) at age 55 if separation occurs in or after the year you turn 55.Withdraw at age 59 1/2 without penalty, but subject to income tax.Withdrawals of contributions are always tax free. Earnings are tax free after five years, assuming one of the following: age 59 1/2, disability, death, qualified first-time home purchase.ContributionsContributions may be pre-tax (Traditional) or after-tax (Roth), or both, subject to IRS annual contribution limits.Contributions may be fully or partially deductible depending on Modified Adjusted Gross Income and other factors.Contributions are not deductible.Tax Deferred GrowthAssets in accounts can grow tax-deferred until you take distributions (except Roth, where qualified distributions are tax-free).Important ConsiderationEven if you decide to rollover out of a TSP, you may want to consider maintaining at least a minimal qualified retirement plan account balance because, in the event you want to transfer or rollover qualified assets to your qualified retirement plan account in the future, to the extent it is allowed by your plan, your plan may require you to have an open account with a balance when you request is received by that plan.Here's How a Transfer WorksA transfer is an easy way to move investment accounts held at other financial institutions to USAA.Steps to a TransferStep 1: Give us some infoWe'll let you know if any of your existing USAA accounts are compatible.Step 2: Pick an accountChoose a USAA account to move assets into or open a new account.Step 3: Send us your formsWe'll get information so that we can begin the transfer.Step 4: We take care of the restWhen we receive your assets, you'll see them credited to your account.What's the Difference Between a Transfer and a Rollover?A transfer is a firm-to-firm movement of securities and cash. For example, Schwab to USAA or vice versa. A rollover — there are two types, direct and indirect — is from a qualified employer plan to an investment company.Here's How an IRA Conversion WorksA conversion is a way to change a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA to get potential advantages like tax-free withdrawals in retirement, estate planning benefits and no required minimum distributions (RMDs).Steps to Convert Your Traditional, SEP or Simple IRA Into a RothStep 1: Complete the formComplete and return the IRA Roth Conversion Form (PDF).Step 2: Get a USAA Roth IRAIf you don't already have a USAA Roth IRA, complete an application by calling 800-531-USAA (that's 800-531-8722) to speak with an advisor.Converting a Traditional IRA to a USAA Roth IRAAny household with income — regardless of tax filing status — can convert a traditional IRA to a USAA Roth IRA. You'll be required to pay income taxes on the amount converted, and additional taxes and penalties may need to be paid if you withdraw converted funds within five years.

Investments/Insurance: Not FDIC Insured • Not Bank Issued, Guaranteed or Underwritten • May Lose Value



Beginning Jan. 1, 2015, you may do only one IRA rollover during any 12-month period regardless of how many IRAs you own.



Prior to requesting an IRA rollover from a qualified retirement plan account, consider whether such rollover is appropriate for you. Although IRA rollovers may have certain advantages, qualified retirement plan accounts have advantages you should consider before proceeding which may include, but are not limited to, low administrative and investment expenses and, if you separate from service at age 55 or older, you have penalty-free access to your qualified retirement plan account funds.

You should consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation to determine whether a qualified retirement plan account rollover to an IRA would be suitable for you.

Withdrawals from an IRA made prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% penalty tax.

At tax time, you can apply to get the withheld 20% back, but it could be a long way off. A better approach is usually to roll the money over directly without ever receiving it.

Traditional IRA distributions may be taxed as ordinary income.

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017 

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund (I Class Shares) outperformed its benchmark, the Russell Midcap Value Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Our position in Expedia, Inc. (1.6% portfolio weighting) has been a top contributor as investors are recognizing some of the company’s strong underlying fundamentals. We think that online travel is an area of secular growth as travel spending expands and bookings activity continues to shift online. We’ve long held a position in Expedia since it is the leading player in a duopoly of online travel agencies in the U.S., and management has a great track record of creating value for shareholders.

		The portfolio benefitted from our position in Ball Corp. (1.5% portfolio weighting). The company finally offered positive news to investors, which provided comfort that management will deliver on prior promises to generate synergies from the recent acquisition with Rexam. We continue to have a favorable view of Ball Corp. given its scale in the industry and the lower cyclicality of its earnings pattern relative to basic materials peers.

		Stock selection in consumer staples was a performance headwind amidst continued challenges for Kroger Co. (0.8% portfolio weighting). The combination of increased competition and food deflation has weighed on results. Despite negative sentiment, we still think that Kroger is relatively well-positioned as the premier player in grocery.

		Our position in AutoZone, Inc. (0.8% portfolio weighting) detracted after the company reported its first negative same-store sales results in four years, as both the tax refund delay and impact from a warm winter weighed on results. Investors reacted negatively to these developments, which in our view created an attractive opportunity to add to our position. From our perspective, long-term industry growth remains intact as the big four players in auto parts retailing continue to take share as the industry consolidates. We like the fact that AutoZone is a rational, high-margin, high-return business with barriers to entry in the form of a complex supply chain.


	Looking ahead


		While financials still represent an attractive opportunity set, we’d look to trim if we find more compelling opportunities.

		Although consumer discretionary remains a large allocation and overweight, the composition of this exposure has shifted away from bricks and mortar retail (we trimmed Tiffany & Co. (1.0% portfolio weighting) and Ralph Lauren Corp. (0.4% portfolio weighting) and towards business models that face less competitive pressures from Amazon, such as AutoZone and Genuine Parts Co. (0.9% portfolio weighting).

		While it is challenging for us to find the types of companies we like owning in energy and remain underweight, we built our position in Williams Cos., Inc. (1.4% portfolio weighting) given sustained underperformance amidst a weak commodity backdrop.

		As retail real estate investment trusts continue to underperform, we are finding compelling risk/reward opportunities since we don’t think company-specific fundamentals have deteriorated as much as the multiples have contracted (Federal Realty Investment Trust (0.5% portfolio weighting) and Brixmor Property Group, Inc. (0.6% portfolio weighting).

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.24% for A Shares, 1.75% for C Shares, 0.99% for I Shares, 0.75% for L Shares, 1.50% for R2 Shares, 1.25% for R3 Shares, 1.00% for R4 Shares, 0.85% for R5 Shares and 0.75% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares, 10/31/2017 for L Shares, 10/31/2017 for R2 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R3 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R4 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R5 Shares and 10/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Russell Midcap Value Index is an unmanaged index measuring the performance of those Russell Midcap companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The performance of the Lipper Mid-Cap Value Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. The performance of the Lipper Multi-Cap Core Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Mid-cap funds typically carry more risk than funds investing in well-established "blue-chip" companies and have historically experienced a greater degree of volatility than the average stock.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

Summary
CRM Small/Mid Cap Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. The CRM Small/Mid Cap Value Fund, under normal circumstances, invests at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of equity and equity related securities of companies with market capitalizations at the time of initial purchase similar to those in the Russell 2500 Value Index or in the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index (together, “small/mid cap companies”) that are publicly traded on a U.S. securities market.
The market capitalization ranges of the Russell 2500 Value Index and/or the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index change constantly, and as a result, the capitalization of small/mid cap companies in which the Fund will invest will also change. As of December 31, 2016, the market capitalization range of the Russell 2500 Value Index was approximately $9 million to $22 billion and the market capitalization range of the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index was approximately $1 billion to $10 billion.
Supported by an experienced team of investment professionals, the portfolio managers make judgments about the relative attractiveness of various securities in selecting stocks for the Fund. This Fund typically will be invested in 45 to 55 stocks. Although the Fund is built from the bottom up, stock-specific risks, sector weightings and risk/reward characteristics are all considered during the portfolio construction process.

Principal investment risks: The Fund invests in value stocks, which can perform differently from the market on whole and may be undervalued for long periods of time. Compared to mutual funds that focus exclusively on large capitalization companies, shares of the Fund may be more volatile because they invest in small and/or mid capitalization companies. Small and mid capitalization companies are likely to have more limited product lines, fewer capital resources and less depth of management than larger companies.
The Funds are subject to risks, which are described in the prospectus. In particular, when compared to mutual funds that focus on larger capitalization companies, shares of the Funds generally are more volatile because of the exposure to smaller and mid capitalization companies, which may have more limited product lines and fewer capital resources. Value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic values.
 The Russell 2500 Value Index is an unmanaged index that measures the performance of those companies in the Russell 2500 Index with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The Russell 2500 Index is an unmanaged index that measures the performance of the 2,500 smallest companies in the Russell 3000 Index. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

 


You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds carefully before investing. Before making an investment, please download a prospectus containing all the information about the Funds or call 800.276.2883. You should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower.            

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results.            

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017.

**Reflects average annual returns. Returns for funds that are less than one year old are not annualized.
The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge.Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%.Maximum applicable contingent deferred sales charges for Class B is 5.00% in the first year, decreasing to 0% after five years.Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase.

1 Year returns reflect total return. 

RISK MEASURES

Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund's sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund's return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 



The Russell 2500TM Value Index is an unmanaged index used as a general measure of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly into an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses. Russell Investment Group is the source and owner of the trademarks, service marks, and copyrights related to the Russell indexes. Russell® is a trademark of Russell Investment Group.The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. If the market prices of the equity securities owned by the fund fall, the value of the fund will decline. Small capitalization companies may have less experienced management, unpredictable earnings growth, and limited product lines, which can cause their share prices to fluctuate more than those of larger firms. Value investing carries the risk that the market will not recognize a security’s intrinsic value for a long time or that a stock considered undervalued. The prices of securities the sub-adviser believes are undervalued may not appreciate as anticipated or may go down.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and additional important information regarding the fund. To obtain the prospectus and/or summary prospectus, please contact your financial professional or click here. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.Transamerica Funds are advised by Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. and distributed by Transamerica Capital, Inc.Not insured by FDIC or any federal government agency.

Risk Management


Value Equity Team Risk Management
At the portfolio level, our experienced investment personnel closely monitor the strategy's positioning, and the active risk resulting from our security selection process and sector allocations.  We evaluate factor and style exposure, as well as the ownership and liquidity profile of each security in the portfolio. 
Enterprise Risk Management
Risk Management is an independent control function at OppenheimerFunds responsible for multiple areas of risk including investment risk, counterparty risk, enterprise risk and performance attribution.  The team is headed by the firm's Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to the CEO.  This structure ensures that the entire Risk Management team is independent from the investment process, allowing us to avoid conflicts of interest and providing a valuable second set of eyes on both investment and enterprise-wide risks.
Core Responsibilities of Risk Management Team

Performs comprehensive portfolio reviews with all investment teams
Monitors individual security holdings across the entire firm
Works with investment teams to set specific maximums for the active weights of securities and sectors, as well as for predicted tracking error and other risk metrics
Independently monitors specified team risk metrics

The aim of our Risk Management team is to enable the portfolio managers to make informed decisions on the risk/reward tradeoffs at play in their respective portfolios.
We believe that risk management is not only a responsibility of the firm, but a critical component of our success.

Value investing involves the risk that undervalued securities may not appreciate as anticipated.

1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Value investing involves the risk that undervalued securities may not appreciate as anticipated. Small and mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a small-sized or mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.


2. 
The net expense ratio (where applicable) also takes into account contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements without which performance would have been less.  These undertakings may not be amended or withdrawn for one year from the date of the current prospectus, unless approved by the Board.


3. 
Access index definitions.


4. 
Holdings are subject to change, and are dollar weighted based on total net assets. Negative weightings may result from the use of leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital in an attempt to increase investment return. Leverage risks include potential for higher volatility, greater decline of the fund's net asset value and fluctuations of dividends and distributions paid by the fund.


5. 
Holdings are subject to change, are dollar-weighted based on assets, and may not reflect the use of leverage in the Fund. Market Cap breakdown is calculated using Morningstar's methodology and those capitalization standards may not align with those in the Fund’s prospectus.


A. 
The performance data quoted represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results.  The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.  Current performance and expense ratios may be lower or higher than the data quoted.  Fund returns include changes in share price, reinvested distributions, and a 5.75% maximum sales charge where indicated.  Returns do not consider capital gains or income taxes on an individual's investment.
↩


B. 
"Year to Date" returns are cumulative, not annualized, and do not reflect sales charges (if sales charges are applicable to the Fund).  These returns would be lower if sales charges were taken into consideration.  Short-term returns may not be indicative of longer-term performance, which should also be considered when making investment decisions.
↩


C. 
Daily net asset value and dollar change of the fund is as of the previous business day's closing. Fund net asset values are updated at approximately 7:00pm ET daily.
↩


D. 
OppenheimerFunds' equity style box is based on the portfolio's overall targeted capitalization range and relative valuation as determined by OFI.
↩


E. 
There is no guarantee of the payment of any dividend or other distributions at any level.

Investments in small-sized, mid-sized and micro-cap companies may involve greater risks than in those of larger, better known companies.
Passively managed funds invest by sampling the index, holding a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance of the index.
These investments may have difficulty in liquidating an investment position without taking a significant discount from current market value, which can be a significant problem with certain lightly traded securities.
Derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal.

Notes & Disclosures
Portfolio composition and allocation is as of 06/30/17 and is subject to change at any time. Totals may not be exact due to rounding. Negative exposures may represent short positions through derivatives.The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell a security. Large concentrations can increase share price volatility.Source: Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Russell 2000� Value Index measures the performance of the small-cap value segment of the U.S. equity universe. It includes those Russell 2000 companies that are considered more value-oriented relative to the overall market as defined by Russell�s leading style methodology. The Russell 2000� Value Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the small-cap value segment. The index is completely reconstituted annually to ensure larger stocks do not distort the performance  and characteristics of the true small-cap opportunity set and that the represented companies continue to reflect value characteristics.Price/earnings for a stock is the ratio of the company's most recent month-end share price to the company's estimated earnings per share (EPS) for the current fiscal year. If a third-party estimate for the current year EPS is not available, Morningstar will calculate an internal estimate based on the most recently reported EPS and average historical earnings growth rates. Price/ earnings is one of the five value factors used to calculate the Morningstar Style Box. For portfolios, this historical P/E data point is calculated by taking an asset-weighted average of the earnings yields (E/P) of all the stocks in the portfolio and then taking the reciprocal of the result. Source: MorningstarReflects the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a particular benchmark. An R-squared of 100 indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark. In order to compare funds across general asset classes, Morningstar calculates R-squared values relative to a "standard" broad-based market index. For example, the R-squared of both a small cap, domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund would be determined against the S&P 500 Index. Thus, the "standard" broad-based market index used by Morningstar may differ from the fund's actual benchmark stated in this factsheet. Source: MorningstarBeta is a measure of the systematic risk of a stock or a portfolio and is an indicator of expected return. A beta higher than 1.0 has higher risk than the overall market has and thus the stock or portfolio can be expected to perform in relation to the overall market in that way.A statistical measurement of dispersion around an average which depicts how widely fund returns varied over a certain period of time.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Investments/Insurance: Not FDIC Insured • Not Bank Issued, Guaranteed or Underwritten • May Lose Value



Morningstar® is an independent service that rates mutual funds and other types of investments. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.



Automatic investment plans don't assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.



Asset allocation funds may change portfolio holding allocations on a frequent basis, resulting in high portfolio turnover and more brokerage commissions from an increased amount of the purchasing and selling of securities. The Fund may have a higher proportion of capital gains and a potentially lower return than a fund that does not have a reallocation policy.

A rollover is a way to move your retirement money from one account to another without triggering current taxes or penalties.This allows you to take money from an employer retirement plan -- such as a 401(k), 403(b) or a thrift savings plan — and put it into an IRA, which stands for individual retirement account.2 Kinds of Rollovers  43 Seconds[00:43]If you decide a rollover is right for you, there are two kinds of rollovers: direct and indirect.With a direct rollover, your employer's retirement plan sends a check payable to USAA.With an indirect rollover, the check is made payable to you and could come with some tax implications.You can learn more about how to start a rollover on this page.Transfers  0 minutes, 00 seconds[01:06]But what if your retirement money isn't in an employer retirement plan?That's where transfers come in.A transfer is a move of an investment account from one financial institution to another.Before You Act  1 minutes, 17 seconds[01:17]There are many things to think about before rolling over or transferring your account, including potential considerations for sticking with your current plan…Potential considerations for sticking with your employer plan: lower costs, employer match, delayed Required Minimum Distributions, loan options and stronger creditor protection.Or considerations for moving your money.Potential considerations for rolling over your plan: opportunity for professional advice and service, consolidated retirement assets may be easier to manage and may have more flexibility and greater selection of investments with an IRA.You can read more about rollovers and transfers…or even open your account on this page today.End  1 minutes, 39 seconds[01:39]Important Legal InformationThe law concerning tax and retirement plans is complex and USAA and its affiliates do not provide tax advice. Please consult your tax and legal advisors regarding your specific situation to help determine next steps.Other options are available besides rolling over your employer-sponsored retirement plan, and an employer-sponsored retirement plan can offer advantages investors can't get if they roll the money into an IRA.Prior to requesting an IRA rollover from a qualified retirement plan account, consider whether such rollover is appropriate for you. Although IRA rollovers may have certain advantages, qualified retirement plan accounts have advantages you should consider before proceeding which may include, but are not limited to, low administrative and investment expenses and, if you separate from service at age 55 or older, you have penalty-free access to your qualified retirement plan account funds. Additionally, you may want to consider maintaining at least a minimal qualified retirement plan account balance because, in the event you want to transfer or rollover qualified assets to your qualified retirement plan account in the future, to the extent it is allowed by your plan, your plan may require you to have an open account with a balance when your request is received by that plan. You should consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation to determine whether a qualified retirement plan account rollover to an IRA would be suitable for you.Prior to requesting an IRA rollover from a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, which is a retirement plan for military or civilian employees of the U.S. government, consider whether such rollover is appropriate for you. Although IRA rollovers may have certain advantages, TSP accounts have advantages you should consider before proceeding which include, but are not limited to, low administrative and investment expenses and, if you separate from government service at age 55 or older, you have penalty-free access to your TSP account funds. Additionally, you may want to consider maintaining at least a minimal TSP account balance because, in the event you want to transfer or rollover qualified assets to your TSP account in the future, you must have an open TSP account with a balance when your request is received by the TSP. You should consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation to determine whether a TSP rollover to an IRA would be suitable for you.Withdrawals from an IRA made prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. If you receive a check made payable to you, your former employer is generally required to withhold 20% of the total amount. When you deposit the check into your IRA, you must make up that percentage from your own resources if you wish to avoid being taxed on the withheld amount. At tax time, you can apply to get the withheld 20% back, but it could be a long way off. A better approach is usually to roll the money over directly without ever receiving it.USAA means United Services Automobile Association and its affiliates.237406-0117Close TranscriptWant to learn more about Rollovers and Transfers?

Here's How a Rollover WorksA rollover is a way to move money — without paying taxes or penalties — from an employer-sponsored or other qualified retirement plan such as a 401(k), 403(b), 457 into an IRA account.Steps to a RolloverStep 1: Create your accountOpen an IRA and select "Rollover" as the funding source.Step 2: Print the instructionsPrint the 401(k) rollover instructions (PDF).Step 3: Move rollover to USAAYour former employer will typically have forms for you to complete.Step 4: Check your accountYou'll be able to view your account activity on usaa.com or our free app.About RolloversA rollover provides:Tax advantages: Your rollover is basically just a continuation of your tax-deferred retirement account from your previous job. You don't pay taxes on it if your designated retirement money is not cashed out immediately.Investment options: A rollover IRA allows you to select from a greater amount of investment options, some of the options includes stocks, bonds, CDs, annuities and a larger selection of mutual funds. There also are several options for retirement income and distribution.Ease: Rolling over previous retirement accounts into one IRA may help simplify your finances.Things to Consider With a RolloverBefore you roll over an employer's retirement plan, such as a 401(k) or a 403(b), into an IRA, think about whether it's the right move for you. Both types of plans have their advantages.Possible Benefits for Sticking With Your Employer's PlanEmployer retirement plans have potentially lower costs.Your employer might offer matching funds.You might be able to make penalty-free withdrawals as soon as you reach the age of 55.If you're employed at age 70½, you don't have to make required minimum distributions (RMDs) from a 401(k). Other plans require RMDs starting at age 70½.You could have the option of making pre- or post-tax contributions.You can take out a loan against part of your balance in some cases.Your plan is possibly protected from creditors and any legal judgments against you. Check your retirement plan outline to find the details of your plan.Potential Benefits of Rolling Over Your PlanProfessional advice and service could be more available with an IRA.Keeping track of a number of retirement plans can be complex or unmanageable, while having a single retirement plan may be more streamlined and easier to manage.You'll likely have more flexibility and a greater selection of investments with an IRA. Consult your tax advisor regarding your specific situation.Note: Only one IRA to IRA rollover is allowed in a 12-month period, no matter how many IRAs you own.1What's the Difference Between a Direct Rollover and an Indirect Rollover?Direct RolloverThis is a direct transfer of funds or a check made out to USAA from your former employer's retirement plan. There are no fees or taxes for this transaction.Indirect RolloverAn indirect rollover is a distribution (typically a check) made payable to you from your former employer's retirement plan that you deposit to an IRA or another retirement plan qualified to receive rollovers. After you receive your distribution, you have 60 calendar days to deposit the money into the IRA or other retirement arrangement. Because the money is sent to you, your former employer's plan must withhold 20% of your plan proceeds. This means you'll receive only 80% of your distribution amount. To keep the distribution (including the 20% withholding amount) tax free, you must still deposit the full 100% into IRA by adding the missing 20% when you make your rollover deposit. Typically, that 20% which was previously withheld from the distribution will either be applied to taxes you owe or returned to you directly from the IRS when you file your tax return. Please consult your tax advisor about your specific situation.Here's How a TSP Rollover WorksIf you were in the military or a civilian employee of the U.S government, you can use your retirement Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to fund a USAA IRA.Steps to a RolloverStep 1: Create your accountOpen an IRA and select "Rollover" as the funding source.Step 2: Complete the TSP formsDownload and complete rollover forms from the TSP website. The most commonly used form for full withdrawals is the TSP-70 form and the TSP-77 for partial withdrawals.Step 3: We take care of the restAfter completing the TSP Rollover forms, USAA needs to complete some portions of the form. They can be mailed, sent via member message or faxed to 800-292-8177.Things to Consider: Thrift Savings Plan, Traditional and Roth IRAs USAA Savings and USAA Performance First DetailsThrift Savings PlanTraditional IRARoth IRAInvestment Options10 funds with low fees based on well-known stock indexes or lifecycle funds based on your anticipated retirement date.Many investment choices, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds.Many investment choices, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds.WithdrawalsPenalty-free (but subject to tax) at age 55 if separation occurs in or after the year you turn 55.Withdraw at age 59 1/2 without penalty, but subject to income tax.Withdrawals of contributions are always tax free. Earnings are tax free after five years, assuming one of the following: age 59 1/2, disability, death, qualified first-time home purchase.ContributionsContributions may be pre-tax (Traditional) or after-tax (Roth), or both, subject to IRS annual contribution limits.Contributions may be fully or partially deductible depending on Modified Adjusted Gross Income and other factors.Contributions are not deductible.Tax Deferred GrowthAssets in accounts can grow tax-deferred until you take distributions (except Roth, where qualified distributions are tax-free).Important ConsiderationEven if you decide to rollover out of a TSP, you may want to consider maintaining at least a minimal qualified retirement plan account balance because, in the event you want to transfer or rollover qualified assets to your qualified retirement plan account in the future, to the extent it is allowed by your plan, your plan may require you to have an open account with a balance when you request is received by that plan.Here's How a Transfer WorksA transfer is an easy way to move investment accounts held at other financial institutions to USAA.Steps to a TransferStep 1: Give us some infoWe'll let you know if any of your existing USAA accounts are compatible.Step 2: Pick an accountChoose a USAA account to move assets into or open a new account.Step 3: Send us your formsWe'll get information so that we can begin the transfer.Step 4: We take care of the restWhen we receive your assets, you'll see them credited to your account.What's the Difference Between a Transfer and a Rollover?A transfer is a firm-to-firm movement of securities and cash. For example, Schwab to USAA or vice versa. A rollover — there are two types, direct and indirect — is from a qualified employer plan to an investment company.Here's How an IRA Conversion WorksA conversion is a way to change a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA to get potential advantages like tax-free withdrawals in retirement, estate planning benefits and no required minimum distributions (RMDs).Steps to Convert Your Traditional, SEP or Simple IRA Into a RothStep 1: Complete the formComplete and return the IRA Roth Conversion Form (PDF).Step 2: Get a USAA Roth IRAIf you don't already have a USAA Roth IRA, complete an application by calling 800-531-USAA (that's 800-531-8722) to speak with an advisor.Converting a Traditional IRA to a USAA Roth IRAAny household with income — regardless of tax filing status — can convert a traditional IRA to a USAA Roth IRA. You'll be required to pay income taxes on the amount converted, and additional taxes and penalties may need to be paid if you withdraw converted funds within five years.

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017 

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund (I Class Shares) outperformed its benchmark, the Russell Midcap Value Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Our position in Expedia, Inc. (1.6% portfolio weighting) has been a top contributor as investors are recognizing some of the company’s strong underlying fundamentals. We think that online travel is an area of secular growth as travel spending expands and bookings activity continues to shift online. We’ve long held a position in Expedia since it is the leading player in a duopoly of online travel agencies in the U.S., and management has a great track record of creating value for shareholders.

		The portfolio benefitted from our position in Ball Corp. (1.5% portfolio weighting). The company finally offered positive news to investors, which provided comfort that management will deliver on prior promises to generate synergies from the recent acquisition with Rexam. We continue to have a favorable view of Ball Corp. given its scale in the industry and the lower cyclicality of its earnings pattern relative to basic materials peers.

		Stock selection in consumer staples was a performance headwind amidst continued challenges for Kroger Co. (0.8% portfolio weighting). The combination of increased competition and food deflation has weighed on results. Despite negative sentiment, we still think that Kroger is relatively well-positioned as the premier player in grocery.

		Our position in AutoZone, Inc. (0.8% portfolio weighting) detracted after the company reported its first negative same-store sales results in four years, as both the tax refund delay and impact from a warm winter weighed on results. Investors reacted negatively to these developments, which in our view created an attractive opportunity to add to our position. From our perspective, long-term industry growth remains intact as the big four players in auto parts retailing continue to take share as the industry consolidates. We like the fact that AutoZone is a rational, high-margin, high-return business with barriers to entry in the form of a complex supply chain.


	Looking ahead


		While financials still represent an attractive opportunity set, we’d look to trim if we find more compelling opportunities.

		Although consumer discretionary remains a large allocation and overweight, the composition of this exposure has shifted away from bricks and mortar retail (we trimmed Tiffany & Co. (1.0% portfolio weighting) and Ralph Lauren Corp. (0.4% portfolio weighting) and towards business models that face less competitive pressures from Amazon, such as AutoZone and Genuine Parts Co. (0.9% portfolio weighting).

		While it is challenging for us to find the types of companies we like owning in energy and remain underweight, we built our position in Williams Cos., Inc. (1.4% portfolio weighting) given sustained underperformance amidst a weak commodity backdrop.

		As retail real estate investment trusts continue to underperform, we are finding compelling risk/reward opportunities since we don’t think company-specific fundamentals have deteriorated as much as the multiples have contracted (Federal Realty Investment Trust (0.5% portfolio weighting) and Brixmor Property Group, Inc. (0.6% portfolio weighting).

The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.24% for A Shares, 1.75% for C Shares, 0.99% for I Shares, 0.75% for L Shares, 1.50% for R2 Shares, 1.25% for R3 Shares, 1.00% for R4 Shares, 0.85% for R5 Shares and 0.75% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares, 10/31/2017 for L Shares, 10/31/2017 for R2 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R3 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R4 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R5 Shares and 10/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it.

It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Mid-cap funds typically carry more risk than funds investing in well-established "blue-chip" companies and have historically experienced a greater degree of volatility than the average stock.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.
