WASHINGTON — President Trump has broadened his search for a new F.B.I. director in recent days, moving to install a leader who would be viewed as independent from the White House amid the backlash over his abrupt dismissal of James B. Comey.Four candidates will be interviewed Saturday, according to a person familiar with the meetings: Andrew G. McCabe, the acting director of the F.B.I.; Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas; Judge Michael J. Garcia of the New York State Court of Appeals and the former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York; and Alice Fisher, a former top Justice Department official who would be the first woman to run the agency.The timing of a nomination is far from clear; the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, provided no firm timeline on Friday.The candidate list is also said to be broader than those four. Mr. Trump has a long history of tossing names out as chum for public consumption, in part to throw people off the scent of what he is doing, and in part to test various options.

The candidates are being looked at, White House officials said, with a particular emphasis in mind: a lack of deep ties to Mr. Trump, to avoid the appearance that he wants to install a crony at the top of an agency that is investigating the activities of his presidential campaign.

Mr. Cornyn served as the Texas attorney general before being elected to the Senate in 2002, where he is the No. 2 Republican in the chamber. He is one of several possible candidates who are current and former members of the House and Senate. 



                Five Contradictions in the White House’s Story About Comey’s Firing            

                The Trump administration has offered conflicting answers about how and why the F.B.I. director, James Comey, was fired.            











But an adviser to Mr. Cornyn said the senator made clear in a conversation with the president on Wednesday that, while open to discussing the post, he is happy in the Senate. The adviser was not authorized to discuss the internal discussions and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Andrew G. McCabeMr. Trump could also do something no president has: Elevate a senior F.B.I. official to be the next director. That would be seen as an olive branch to the bureau and would help avoid allegations that Mr. Trump was selecting a political loyalist.Mr. McCabe, 49, is a career F.B.I. agent who was Mr. Comey’s deputy before moving in as acting director after Mr. Comey’s firing. He has been at the center of a number of high-profile counterterrorism investigations, including the one into the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the arrest and interrogation of a suspect in the 2012 attacks on the American compounds in Benghazi, Libya.Judge Michael J. GarciaMr. Garcia spent nearly a decade as a federal prosecutor in New York City before President George W. Bush appointed him assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2003 and United States attorney two years later.Before Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appointed Mr. Garcia to New York State’s highest court in 2016, he worked in private practice and led a more than yearlong inquiry into FIFA, the global governing body of soccer that became the centerpiece of a sprawling corruption case announced by the United States in 2015. Mr. Garcia abruptly resigned from the investigation in 2014, disagreeing with the way the organization had characterized the results of his inquiry, which were never made public.

Mr. Rogers is the former chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee, who represented Michigan and once served as an agent in the bureau. Respected among agents who felt he was a straight shooter, he probably has the credibility to steer the F.B.I. out of a hurricane of bad publicity.Raymond W. Kelly

Mr. Trump and his advisers have asked some people whether they believe Mr. Kelly, the former New York police commissioner, would be “loyal,” language similar to what he used in questioning Mr. Comey’s effectiveness, according to people briefed on the discussions. In Mr. Kelly’s case, they said, the White House appeared to be trying to assess whether he would seek to advance his own image, as Mr. Trump accused Mr. Comey of doing.Mr. Kelly declined to comment on whether he had spoken with the president about the job. He is said to be seen as outside the top tier of candidates because the job is a 10-year appointment and at 75, he is older than many of the other prospects.As police commissioner, he also had a combative relationship with the F.B.I., with the two agencies frequently engaged in turf wars. He was widely disliked among agents who felt he constantly worked to undermine the F.B.I., creating a legacy of mistrust.Other possibilities

Kelly Ayotte, the former New Hampshire attorney general who lost her seat in the United States Senate last year, has been pushed by some of her Senate colleagues and some Republican advisers to the White House who believe that she would easily be confirmed.

But Mr. Trump has remained leery of Ms. Ayotte, who publicly broke with him during his presidential campaign and criticized him, according to people close to the White House.George Terwilliger, who helped lead the George W. Bush campaign’s recount efforts in 2000 and served as deputy attorney general under Mr. Bush’s father, is another name being batted about.Chief among the White House’s concerns is that the Senate confirmation process go smoothly. Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have made calls to people outside the White House asking their opinions of different candidates.

Education and early work[edit]
Born in Tyler, Texas, Luttig received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington and Lee University in 1976. He then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1981. He served briefly in the Reagan administration, where his duties included reviewing potential judicial appointments and vetting them for ideological consistency with the administration's policies. From 1982 to 1984, he clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the potential judges he had vetted in his prior job, and for Chief Justice Warren Burger.[1] Luttig later served as co-executor of Burger's one-page will, which gained notoriety for Burger's failure to dictate how estate taxes should be paid.[2][3] Luttig continued to work for Burger as a special assistant until 1985, when he entered private practice at the Washington office of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In 1989, Luttig returned to government service, holding various positions within the United States Department of Justice until 1991 under George H. W. Bush.[1] His duties in the Justice Department included assisting Supreme Court nominees David Souter and Clarence Thomas with their Senate confirmation proceedings. His assistance of Thomas proved somewhat controversial because he assisted Thomas in his highly contested hearing after his own appointment to the federal bench had been approved by the Senate, but he did not take office as a judge until after the Thomas hearings had concluded.[4][5]
Federal judgeship[edit]
On April 23, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Luttig to fill a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1991 and receiving his commission on August 2, 1991, he became the youngest judge (at age 37) on a federal appeals court at the time of his appointment.[5]
On the bench, Luttig was compared to Justice Scalia for his analytical rigor and for criticizing his colleagues for inconsistencies or embellishments in their judicial opinions.[6] He was also similar to Scalia in that his judicial philosophy sometimes led to what were seen as anti-conservative opinions.[1][5]
Luttig was mentioned frequently as being near the top of George W. Bush's list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States despite opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a dispute between Luttig and the Bush administration over the handling of the case of alleged "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla (see below).[7][8] Bush interviewed but ultimately did not choose Luttig to fill two Supreme Court vacancies in 2005.
Luttig was the leading feeder judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with virtually all of his law clerks having gone on to clerk with conservative justices on the Supreme Court,[9] a total of 40 with 33 clerking for either Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia.[10] Luttig's clerks have nicknamed themselves "Luttigators".
John Luttig's murder[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (May 2017)


Luttig's father, John Luttig, was fatally shot in 1994 in a carjacking by Napoleon Beazley. Beazley was eventually executed after twice appealing to the Supreme Court, where Justices Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because of past associations with Luttig. Scalia recused himself because Luttig had clerked for him, and Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because Luttig led the George H. W. Bush Administration's efforts to gain the Senate's confirmation for them.[11] This case is also noteworthy for the fact that Beazley became one the last juvenile offenders executed before its abolition with Roper v Simmons in 2005.
Cases[edit]
José Padilla and clash with Bush administration[edit]
In September 2005, Luttig wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, which upheld the government's power to designate José Padilla, the alleged "dirty bomber" who was captured at a Chicago airport, as an "enemy combatant" and to detain him in a military brig without charge.[12] In December, the Bush administration, anticipating a reversal in the Supreme Court, petitioned the Fourth Circuit for approval to transfer Padilla to civilian custody for a criminal trial. The move set off a dispute between the Bush administration and Luttig.[13] Luttig's panel refused to grant the transfer and castigated the government for potentially harming its "credibility before the courts".[14] The government petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the transfer by arguing that the lower court's refusal encroached on the power of the President. The Supreme Court granted the government's request.[15]
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld[edit]
In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Luttig disagreed with the majority opinion and believed that Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held as an enemy combatant, deserved "meaningful judicial review" of his case.[1] The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.
Resignation[edit]
In 2006 Luttig resigned to become general counsel and senior vice president for The Boeing Company.[16][17] In his resignation letter, Luttig wrote, "Boeing may well be the only company in America for which I would have ever considered leaving the court."[18] He also mentioned his two children's upcoming college education; the position at Boeing promised more pay than the federal judgeship. At the time of his resignation, federal appellate judges were paid $175,100 annually.[19] According to Boeing's 2008 Annual Report, Luttig's total compensation for 2008 was $2,798,962.[20]

Hamdi v. Rumsfeld[edit]
In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Luttig disagreed with the majority opinion and believed that Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held as an enemy combatant, deserved "meaningful judicial review" of his case.[1] The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.
Resignation[edit]
In 2006 Luttig resigned to become general counsel and senior vice president for The Boeing Company.[16][17] In his resignation letter, Luttig wrote, "Boeing may well be the only company in America for which I would have ever considered leaving the court."[18] He also mentioned his two children's upcoming college education; the position at Boeing promised more pay than the federal judgeship. At the time of his resignation, federal appellate judges were paid $175,100 annually.[19] According to Boeing's 2008 Annual Report, Luttig's total compensation for 2008 was $2,798,962.[20]

Education and early work[edit]
Born in Tyler, Texas, Luttig received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington and Lee University in 1976. He then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1981. He served briefly in the Reagan administration, where his duties included reviewing potential judicial appointments and vetting them for ideological consistency with the administration's policies. From 1982 to 1984, he clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the potential judges he had vetted in his prior job, and for Chief Justice Warren Burger.[1] Luttig later served as co-executor of Burger's one-page will, which gained notoriety for Burger's failure to dictate how estate taxes should be paid.[2][3] Luttig continued to work for Burger as a special assistant until 1985, when he entered private practice at the Washington office of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In 1989, Luttig returned to government service, holding various positions within the United States Department of Justice until 1991 under George H. W. Bush.[1] His duties in the Justice Department included assisting Supreme Court nominees David Souter and Clarence Thomas with their Senate confirmation proceedings. His assistance of Thomas proved somewhat controversial because he assisted Thomas in his highly contested hearing after his own appointment to the federal bench had been approved by the Senate, but he did not take office as a judge until after the Thomas hearings had concluded.[4][5]
Federal judgeship[edit]
On April 23, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Luttig to fill a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1991 and receiving his commission on August 2, 1991, he became the youngest judge (at age 37) on a federal appeals court at the time of his appointment.[5]
On the bench, Luttig was compared to Justice Scalia for his analytical rigor and for criticizing his colleagues for inconsistencies or embellishments in their judicial opinions.[6] He was also similar to Scalia in that his judicial philosophy sometimes led to what were seen as anti-conservative opinions.[1][5]
Luttig was mentioned frequently as being near the top of George W. Bush's list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States despite opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a dispute between Luttig and the Bush administration over the handling of the case of alleged "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla (see below).[7][8] Bush interviewed but ultimately did not choose Luttig to fill two Supreme Court vacancies in 2005.
Luttig was the leading feeder judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with virtually all of his law clerks having gone on to clerk with conservative justices on the Supreme Court,[9] a total of 40 with 33 clerking for either Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia.[10] Luttig's clerks have nicknamed themselves "Luttigators".
John Luttig's murder[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (May 2017)


Luttig's father, John Luttig, was fatally shot in 1994 in a carjacking by Napoleon Beazley. Beazley was eventually executed after twice appealing to the Supreme Court, where Justices Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because of past associations with Luttig. Scalia recused himself because Luttig had clerked for him, and Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because Luttig led the George H. W. Bush Administration's efforts to gain the Senate's confirmation for them.[11] This case is also noteworthy for the fact that Beazley became one the last juvenile offenders executed before its abolition with Roper v Simmons in 2005.
Cases[edit]
José Padilla and clash with Bush administration[edit]
In September 2005, Luttig wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, which upheld the government's power to designate José Padilla, the alleged "dirty bomber" who was captured at a Chicago airport, as an "enemy combatant" and to detain him in a military brig without charge.[12] In December, the Bush administration, anticipating a reversal in the Supreme Court, petitioned the Fourth Circuit for approval to transfer Padilla to civilian custody for a criminal trial. The move set off a dispute between the Bush administration and Luttig.[13] Luttig's panel refused to grant the transfer and castigated the government for potentially harming its "credibility before the courts".[14] The government petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the transfer by arguing that the lower court's refusal encroached on the power of the President. The Supreme Court granted the government's request.[15]
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld[edit]
In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Luttig disagreed with the majority opinion and believed that Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held as an enemy combatant, deserved "meaningful judicial review" of his case.[1] The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.
Resignation[edit]
In 2006 Luttig resigned to become general counsel and senior vice president for The Boeing Company.[16][17] In his resignation letter, Luttig wrote, "Boeing may well be the only company in America for which I would have ever considered leaving the court."[18] He also mentioned his two children's upcoming college education; the position at Boeing promised more pay than the federal judgeship. At the time of his resignation, federal appellate judges were paid $175,100 annually.[19] According to Boeing's 2008 Annual Report, Luttig's total compensation for 2008 was $2,798,962.[20]

Education and early work[edit]
Born in Tyler, Texas, Luttig received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington and Lee University in 1976. He then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1981. He served briefly in the Reagan administration, where his duties included reviewing potential judicial appointments and vetting them for ideological consistency with the administration's policies. From 1982 to 1984, he clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the potential judges he had vetted in his prior job, and for Chief Justice Warren Burger.[1] Luttig later served as co-executor of Burger's one-page will, which gained notoriety for Burger's failure to dictate how estate taxes should be paid.[2][3] Luttig continued to work for Burger as a special assistant until 1985, when he entered private practice at the Washington office of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In 1989, Luttig returned to government service, holding various positions within the United States Department of Justice until 1991 under George H. W. Bush.[1] His duties in the Justice Department included assisting Supreme Court nominees David Souter and Clarence Thomas with their Senate confirmation proceedings. His assistance of Thomas proved somewhat controversial because he assisted Thomas in his highly contested hearing after his own appointment to the federal bench had been approved by the Senate, but he did not take office as a judge until after the Thomas hearings had concluded.[4][5]
Federal judgeship[edit]
On April 23, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Luttig to fill a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1991 and receiving his commission on August 2, 1991, he became the youngest judge (at age 37) on a federal appeals court at the time of his appointment.[5]
On the bench, Luttig was compared to Justice Scalia for his analytical rigor and for criticizing his colleagues for inconsistencies or embellishments in their judicial opinions.[6] He was also similar to Scalia in that his judicial philosophy sometimes led to what were seen as anti-conservative opinions.[1][5]
Luttig was mentioned frequently as being near the top of George W. Bush's list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States despite opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a dispute between Luttig and the Bush administration over the handling of the case of alleged "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla (see below).[7][8] Bush interviewed but ultimately did not choose Luttig to fill two Supreme Court vacancies in 2005.
Luttig was the leading feeder judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with virtually all of his law clerks having gone on to clerk with conservative justices on the Supreme Court,[9] a total of 40 with 33 clerking for either Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia.[10] Luttig's clerks have nicknamed themselves "Luttigators".
John Luttig's murder[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (May 2017)


Luttig's father, John Luttig, was fatally shot in 1994 in a carjacking by Napoleon Beazley. Beazley was eventually executed after twice appealing to the Supreme Court, where Justices Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because of past associations with Luttig. Scalia recused himself because Luttig had clerked for him, and Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because Luttig led the George H. W. Bush Administration's efforts to gain the Senate's confirmation for them.[11] This case is also noteworthy for the fact that Beazley became one the last juvenile offenders executed before its abolition with Roper v Simmons in 2005.
Cases[edit]
José Padilla and clash with Bush administration[edit]
In September 2005, Luttig wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, which upheld the government's power to designate José Padilla, the alleged "dirty bomber" who was captured at a Chicago airport, as an "enemy combatant" and to detain him in a military brig without charge.[12] In December, the Bush administration, anticipating a reversal in the Supreme Court, petitioned the Fourth Circuit for approval to transfer Padilla to civilian custody for a criminal trial. The move set off a dispute between the Bush administration and Luttig.[13] Luttig's panel refused to grant the transfer and castigated the government for potentially harming its "credibility before the courts".[14] The government petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the transfer by arguing that the lower court's refusal encroached on the power of the President. The Supreme Court granted the government's request.[15]
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld[edit]
In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Luttig disagreed with the majority opinion and believed that Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held as an enemy combatant, deserved "meaningful judicial review" of his case.[1] The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.
Resignation[edit]
In 2006 Luttig resigned to become general counsel and senior vice president for The Boeing Company.[16][17] In his resignation letter, Luttig wrote, "Boeing may well be the only company in America for which I would have ever considered leaving the court."[18] He also mentioned his two children's upcoming college education; the position at Boeing promised more pay than the federal judgeship. At the time of his resignation, federal appellate judges were paid $175,100 annually.[19] According to Boeing's 2008 Annual Report, Luttig's total compensation for 2008 was $2,798,962.[20]

Our main service is providing  Illinois attorney referrals and legal guidance.  In addition to our personalized referrals, Illinoislawyers.com also provides a directory of almost all licensed attorneys in Illinois. The list, which we update daily, includes attorneys who are licensed in Illinois and who are physically in Illinois. The list does not include attorneys who have let their registration lapse or those who are out of state.
You can search by an attorney's first or last name, the name of a law firm, or their city. Each listing should include an attorney's name and the name of their firm, along with their address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, website, and the year they were admitted to practice in Illinois. We also try to include, based on our research, the area of law in which the attorney practices.
The list is a good way to get the contact information for an Illinois attorney or law firm. We want to be clear that this list is completely different and separate from our attorney referral list. The network of attorneys we have created for referrals is a specific list of the Illinois attorneys we know and trust. Our network is made up of attorneys we would hire ourselves if we needed a lawyer. Basically, we have handpicked the attorneys we recommend to you.
If you have any questions related to this list, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Attorney Finder:
There are two ways to find contact information for Illinois lawyers:

Start typing the last name and click on the attorney when you find the one you are looking for.

Education and early work[edit]
Born in Tyler, Texas, Luttig received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington and Lee University in 1976. He then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1981. He served briefly in the Reagan administration, where his duties included reviewing potential judicial appointments and vetting them for ideological consistency with the administration's policies. From 1982 to 1984, he clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the potential judges he had vetted in his prior job, and for Chief Justice Warren Burger.[1] Luttig later served as co-executor of Burger's one-page will, which gained notoriety for Burger's failure to dictate how estate taxes should be paid.[2][3] Luttig continued to work for Burger as a special assistant until 1985, when he entered private practice at the Washington office of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In 1989, Luttig returned to government service, holding various positions within the United States Department of Justice until 1991 under George H. W. Bush.[1] His duties in the Justice Department included assisting Supreme Court nominees David Souter and Clarence Thomas with their Senate confirmation proceedings. His assistance of Thomas proved somewhat controversial because he assisted Thomas in his highly contested hearing after his own appointment to the federal bench had been approved by the Senate, but he did not take office as a judge until after the Thomas hearings had concluded.[4][5]
Federal judgeship[edit]
On April 23, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Luttig to fill a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1991 and receiving his commission on August 2, 1991, he became the youngest judge (at age 37) on a federal appeals court at the time of his appointment.[5]
On the bench, Luttig was compared to Justice Scalia for his analytical rigor and for criticizing his colleagues for inconsistencies or embellishments in their judicial opinions.[6] He was also similar to Scalia in that his judicial philosophy sometimes led to what were seen as anti-conservative opinions.[1][5]
Luttig was mentioned frequently as being near the top of George W. Bush's list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States despite opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a dispute between Luttig and the Bush administration over the handling of the case of alleged "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla (see below).[7][8] Bush interviewed but ultimately did not choose Luttig to fill two Supreme Court vacancies in 2005.
Luttig was the leading feeder judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with virtually all of his law clerks having gone on to clerk with conservative justices on the Supreme Court,[9] a total of 40 with 33 clerking for either Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia.[10] Luttig's clerks have nicknamed themselves "Luttigators".
John Luttig's murder[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (May 2017)


Luttig's father, John Luttig, was fatally shot in 1994 in a carjacking by Napoleon Beazley. Beazley was eventually executed after twice appealing to the Supreme Court, where Justices Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because of past associations with Luttig. Scalia recused himself because Luttig had clerked for him, and Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because Luttig led the George H. W. Bush Administration's efforts to gain the Senate's confirmation for them.[11] This case is also noteworthy for the fact that Beazley became one the last juvenile offenders executed before its abolition with Roper v Simmons in 2005.
Cases[edit]
José Padilla and clash with Bush administration[edit]
In September 2005, Luttig wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, which upheld the government's power to designate José Padilla, the alleged "dirty bomber" who was captured at a Chicago airport, as an "enemy combatant" and to detain him in a military brig without charge.[12] In December, the Bush administration, anticipating a reversal in the Supreme Court, petitioned the Fourth Circuit for approval to transfer Padilla to civilian custody for a criminal trial. The move set off a dispute between the Bush administration and Luttig.[13] Luttig's panel refused to grant the transfer and castigated the government for potentially harming its "credibility before the courts".[14] The government petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the transfer by arguing that the lower court's refusal encroached on the power of the President. The Supreme Court granted the government's request.[15]
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld[edit]
In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Luttig disagreed with the majority opinion and believed that Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held as an enemy combatant, deserved "meaningful judicial review" of his case.[1] The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.
Resignation[edit]
In 2006 Luttig resigned to become general counsel and senior vice president for The Boeing Company.[16][17] In his resignation letter, Luttig wrote, "Boeing may well be the only company in America for which I would have ever considered leaving the court."[18] He also mentioned his two children's upcoming college education; the position at Boeing promised more pay than the federal judgeship. At the time of his resignation, federal appellate judges were paid $175,100 annually.[19] According to Boeing's 2008 Annual Report, Luttig's total compensation for 2008 was $2,798,962.[20]

His assistance of Thomas proved somewhat controversial because he assisted Thomas in his highly contested hearing after his own appointment to the federal bench had been approved by the Senate, but he did not take office as a judge until after the Thomas hearings had concluded.[4][5]
Federal judgeship[edit]
On April 23, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Luttig to fill a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1991 and receiving his commission on August 2, 1991, he became the youngest judge (at age 37) on a federal appeals court at the time of his appointment.[5]

José Padilla and clash with Bush administration[edit]
In September 2005, Luttig wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, which upheld the government's power to designate José Padilla, the alleged "dirty bomber" who was captured at a Chicago airport, as an "enemy combatant" and to detain him in a military brig without charge.[12] In December, the Bush administration, anticipating a reversal in the Supreme Court, petitioned the Fourth Circuit for approval to transfer Padilla to civilian custody for a criminal trial. The move set off a dispute between the Bush administration and Luttig.[13] Luttig's panel refused to grant the transfer and castigated the government for potentially harming its "credibility before the courts".[14] The government petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the transfer by arguing that the lower court's refusal encroached on the power of the President. The Supreme Court granted the government's request.[15]
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld[edit]
In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Luttig disagreed with the majority opinion and believed that Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held as an enemy combatant, deserved "meaningful judicial review" of his case.[1] The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.
Resignation[edit]
In 2006 Luttig resigned to become general counsel and senior vice president for The Boeing Company.[16][17] In his resignation letter, Luttig wrote, "Boeing may well be the only company in America for which I would have ever considered leaving the court."[18] He also mentioned his two children's upcoming college education; the position at Boeing promised more pay than the federal judgeship. At the time of his resignation, federal appellate judges were paid $175,100 annually.[19] According to Boeing's 2008 Annual Report, Luttig's total compensation for 2008 was $2,798,962.[20]

Education and early work[edit]
Born in Tyler, Texas, Luttig received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington and Lee University in 1976. He then attended the University of Virginia School of Law, where he received his Juris Doctor in 1981. He served briefly in the Reagan administration, where his duties included reviewing potential judicial appointments and vetting them for ideological consistency with the administration's policies. From 1982 to 1984, he clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the potential judges he had vetted in his prior job, and for Chief Justice Warren Burger.[1] Luttig later served as co-executor of Burger's one-page will, which gained notoriety for Burger's failure to dictate how estate taxes should be paid.[2][3] Luttig continued to work for Burger as a special assistant until 1985, when he entered private practice at the Washington office of Davis Polk & Wardwell. In 1989, Luttig returned to government service, holding various positions within the United States Department of Justice until 1991 under George H. W. Bush.[1] His duties in the Justice Department included assisting Supreme Court nominees David Souter and Clarence Thomas with their Senate confirmation proceedings. His assistance of Thomas proved somewhat controversial because he assisted Thomas in his highly contested hearing after his own appointment to the federal bench had been approved by the Senate, but he did not take office as a judge until after the Thomas hearings had concluded.[4][5]
Federal judgeship[edit]
On April 23, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Luttig to fill a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1991 and receiving his commission on August 2, 1991, he became the youngest judge (at age 37) on a federal appeals court at the time of his appointment.[5]
On the bench, Luttig was compared to Justice Scalia for his analytical rigor and for criticizing his colleagues for inconsistencies or embellishments in their judicial opinions.[6] He was also similar to Scalia in that his judicial philosophy sometimes led to what were seen as anti-conservative opinions.[1][5]
Luttig was mentioned frequently as being near the top of George W. Bush's list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States despite opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a dispute between Luttig and the Bush administration over the handling of the case of alleged "dirty bomber" Jose Padilla (see below).[7][8] Bush interviewed but ultimately did not choose Luttig to fill two Supreme Court vacancies in 2005.
Luttig was the leading feeder judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, with virtually all of his law clerks having gone on to clerk with conservative justices on the Supreme Court,[9] a total of 40 with 33 clerking for either Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia.[10] Luttig's clerks have nicknamed themselves "Luttigators".
John Luttig's murder[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (May 2017)


Luttig's father, John Luttig, was fatally shot in 1994 in a carjacking by Napoleon Beazley. Beazley was eventually executed after twice appealing to the Supreme Court, where Justices Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because of past associations with Luttig. Scalia recused himself because Luttig had clerked for him, and Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas recused themselves because Luttig led the George H. W. Bush Administration's efforts to gain the Senate's confirmation for them.[11] This case is also noteworthy for the fact that Beazley became one the last juvenile offenders executed before its abolition with Roper v Simmons in 2005.
Cases[edit]
José Padilla and clash with Bush administration[edit]
In September 2005, Luttig wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, which upheld the government's power to designate José Padilla, the alleged "dirty bomber" who was captured at a Chicago airport, as an "enemy combatant" and to detain him in a military brig without charge.[12] In December, the Bush administration, anticipating a reversal in the Supreme Court, petitioned the Fourth Circuit for approval to transfer Padilla to civilian custody for a criminal trial. The move set off a dispute between the Bush administration and Luttig.[13] Luttig's panel refused to grant the transfer and castigated the government for potentially harming its "credibility before the courts".[14] The government petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the transfer by arguing that the lower court's refusal encroached on the power of the President. The Supreme Court granted the government's request.[15]
Hamdi v. Rumsfeld[edit]
In the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Luttig disagreed with the majority opinion and believed that Yaser Esam Hamdi, an American citizen captured in Afghanistan and held as an enemy combatant, deserved "meaningful judicial review" of his case.[1] The Supreme Court reversed the judgment.
Resignation[edit]
In 2006 Luttig resigned to become general counsel and senior vice president for The Boeing Company.[16][17] In his resignation letter, Luttig wrote, "Boeing may well be the only company in America for which I would have ever considered leaving the court."[18] He also mentioned his two children's upcoming college education; the position at Boeing promised more pay than the federal judgeship. At the time of his resignation, federal appellate judges were paid $175,100 annually.[19] According to Boeing's 2008 Annual Report, Luttig's total compensation for 2008 was $2,798,962.[20]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
