What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

What Is a BCG Matrix?


                        By Marci Martin, Business News Daily Contributor
 May 12, 2017 11:24 am EST



















MORE










Any business knows that, to survive, it has to have products that bring in money now and products that will bring in money in the future, and identify which products are a drain on resources without potential to come back. While it's easy to identify the profitable products, determining how the rest of your portfolio fits into the growth scheme can be harder. The BCG matrix was designed as an analysis tool to help you determine the role of products on your future profit margin so you can decide where to invest.
Created by the Boston Consulting Group, the BCG matrix – also known as the Boston or growth-share matrix – provides a framework for analyzing products according to growth and market share. The BCG matrix has been used since 1968 to help companies gain insights on what products best help them capitalize on market-share growth opportunities.
Reeves Martin, senior partner and managing director of the Boston Consulting Group, said that nearly 50 years after its inception, the BCG matrix remains a valuable tool for helping companies understand their potential.
Creating your matrix
First, you'll need data on the market share and growth rate of your products or services. When examining market growth, you need to objectively compare yourself to your largest competitor and think in terms of growth over the next three years. If your market is extremely fragmented, however, you can use absolute market share instead, according to the Strategic Thinker blog.
Next, you can either draw a matrix or find a BCG chart program online. (There are several that are free, available for subscription or part of another charting program.) In this four-quadrant chart, market share is shown on the horizontal line (low left, high right) and growth rate along the vertical line (low bottom, high top). The four quadrants are designated "stars" (upper left), "question marks" (upper right), "cash cows" (lower left) and "dogs" (lower right).

Place each of your products into the appropriate box based on where they rank in market share and growth. Where you choose to set the dividing line between each quadrant depends in part on how your company compares to the competition. Here is a breakdown of each quadrant:
Stars: The business units or products that have the best market share and generate the most cash are considered stars. Monopolies and first-to-market products are frequently termed stars. However, because of their high growth rate, stars also consume large amounts of cash. This generally results in the same amount of money coming in that is going out. Stars can eventually become cash cows if they sustain their success until a time when the market growth rate declines. Companies are advised to invest in stars.
Cash cows: Cash cows are the leaders in the marketplace and generate more cash than they consume. These are business units or products that have a high market share but low growth prospects. According to NetMBA, cash cows provide the cash required to turn question marks into market leaders, cover the administrative costs of the company, fund research and development, service the corporate debt, and pay dividends to shareholders. Companies are advised to invest in cash cows to maintain the current level of productivity, or to "milk" the gains passively.
Dogs: Also known as pets, dogs are units or products that have both a low market share and a low growth rate. They frequently break even, neither earning nor consuming a great deal of cash. Dogs are generally considered cash traps because businesses have money tied up in them, even though they are bringing back basically nothing in return. These business units are prime candidates for divestiture.
Question marks: These parts of a business have high growth prospects but a low market share. They consume a lot of cash but bring little in return. In the end, question marks, also known as problem children, lose money. However, since these business units are growing rapidly, they do have the potential to turn into stars. Companies are advised to invest in question marks if the product has potential for growth, or to sell if it does not.
Using the matrix to strategize
Now that you know where each business unit or product stands, you can evaluate them objectively. In an article on Marketing 91, author Hitesh Bhasin outlines four potential strategies you can follow based on the results of your BCG matrix analysis:

Build – Increase investment in a product to increase its market share. For example, you can push a question mark into a star and, finally, a cash cow.
Hold – If you can't invest more into a product, hold it in the same quadrant and leave it be.
Harvest – Reduce your investment and try to take out the maximum cash flow from the product, which increases its overall profitability (best for cash cows).
Divest – Release the amount of money already stuck in the business (best for dogs).

The article in Strategic Thinker notes that you want a balance. You need products in every quadrant in order to keep a healthy cash flow and have products that can secure your future.
The role of cash flow in the matrix
Understanding cash flow is key to making the most of the BCG matrix. In 1968, BCG founder Bruce Henderson noted that four rules are responsible for product cash flow:

Margins and cash generated are a function of market share. High margins and high market share go together.
To grow, you need to invest in your assets. The added cash required to hold share is a function of growth rates.
High market share must be earned or bought. Buying market share requires an additional increment or investment.
No product market can grow indefinitely. You need to get your payoff from growth when the growth slows; you lose your opportunity if you hesitate. The payoff is cash that cannot be reinvested in that product.

That last point is even more important now than ever. The market moves more quickly now than it did 40 years ago, and BCG has since published some recommended revisions to analyzing and acting on the matrix information. Keeping a healthy supply of question marks keeps you ready to act on the next trend, while cash cows need to be milked efficiently because they may fall out of favor – and profitability – more quickly.
"With a few tweaks, the matrix can be adapted to help companies drive the strategic experimentation required for success, even in unpredictable markets," Martin said. "The matrix needs to be applied with accelerated speed, while balancing the investments between exploration in new segments and exploitation of established segments. In addition, the investments and divestments need to be managed rigorously, while carefully measuring and monitoring the portfolio economics of experimentation."

An alternative for another look
While a great tool, the BCG matrix isn't for everyone. Some businesses find they don't have products in each quadrant, nor do they have steady movement of products among the quadrants as they progress in their life cycles.
Some consultants advocate the use of the GE/McKinsey matrix instead. The GE/McKinsey matrix offers more categorization options and measures products according to business-unit strength and industry attractiveness rather than market share, the complexity of which may be outside an individual company's control. Comparing the two can reveal hidden insights that power more growth for your company.

      MATRIX MANAGEMENT AND
      
       STRUCTURE

      Matrix management is a technique of managing an organization (or, more
      commonly, part of an organization) through a series of dual-reporting
      relationships instead of a more traditional linear management structure.
      In contrast to most other organizational structures, which arrange
      managers and employees by function or product, matrix management combines
      functional and product departments in a dual authority system. In its
      simplest form, a matrix configuration may be known as a cross-functional
      work team, which brings together individuals who report to different parts
      of the company in order to complete a particular project or task. The term
      "matrix" is derived from the representative diagram of a
      matrix management system, which resembles a rectangular array or grid of
      functions and product/project groups.
    

      The practice is most associated with highly collaborative and complex
      projects, such as building aircraft, but is also widely used in many
      product/project management situations. Even when a company does not label
      its structure a matrix system or represent it as such on an organization
      chart, there may be an implicit matrix structure any time employees are
      grouped into work teams (this does not normally include committees, task
      forces, and the like) that are headed by someone other than their primary
      supervisor.
    


        NEW ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS
      


      In the late 1800s and early 1900s, during the U.S. industrial revolution,
      a need emerged for more formalized structures in large business
      organizations. The earliest models emphasized efficiency of process
      through managerial control. Described as "mechanistic,"
      those systems were characterized by extensive rules and procedures,
      centralized authority, and an acute division of labor. They sought to
      create organizations that mimicked machines, and usually departmentalized
      workers by function, such as finance and production. Important theories
      during that era included German sociologist Max Weber's (1881-1961)
      ideal bureaucracy, which was based on absolute authority, logic, and
      order.
    

      During the 1920s and 1930s, new ideas about the structure and nature of
      organizations began to surface. Inspired by the work of thinkers and
      behaviorists such as Harvard researcher Elton Mayo, who conducted the
      famed 
      
        Hawthorne Experiments,
      
       theories about management structure began to incorporate a more
      humanistic view. Those theoretical organizational structures were
      classified as "organic," and recognized the importance of
      human behavior and cultural influences in organizations. While the
      mechanistic school of thought stressed efficiency and production through
      control, organic models emphasized flexibility and adaptability through
      employee empowerment. From a structural standpoint, mechanistic
      organizations tended to be vertical or hierarchical with decisions flowing
      down through several channels. Organic models, on the other hand, were
      comparatively flat, or horizontal, and had few managerial levels or
      centralized controls.
    

      Many proponents of organic organizational theory believed it was the
      solution to the drawbacks of mechanistic organizations. Indeed,
      mechanistic organizations often stifled human creativity and motivation
      and were generally insensitive to external influences, such as shifting
      markets or consumer needs. In contrast, companies that used organic
      management structures tended to be more responsive and creative. However,
      many organizations that adopted the organic approach also discovered that,
      among other drawbacks, it sometimes lacked efficiency and personal
      accountability and failed to make the most productive use of some
      workers' expertise.
    

      As an alternative to basic organic structures, many companies during the
      mid-1900s embraced a model that minimized the faults and maximized the
      benefits of different organic management structures, as discussed below.
      Possibly the first application of what would later be referred to as the
      "matrix" structure was employed in 1947 by General Chemicals
      in its engineering department. In the early 1960s a more formalized matrix
      method called "unit management" was implemented by a large
      number of U.S. hospitals. Not until 1965, however, was matrix management
      formally recognized.
    

      The first organization to design and implement a formal matrix structure
      was the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA
      developed a matrix management system for its space program because it
      needed to simultaneously emphasize several different functions and
      projects, none of which could be stressed at the expense of another. It
      found that traditional management structures were too bureaucratic,
      hierarchical, slow-moving, and inflexible. Likewise, basic organic
      structures were too departmentalized (i.e. myopic), thus failing to
      productively use the far-reaching expertise NASA had at its disposal.
      NASA's matrix solution overcame those problems by synthesizing
      projects, such as designing a rocket booster, with organizational
      functions, such as staffing and finance.
    

      Despite doubts about its effectiveness in many applications, matrix
      management gained broad acceptance in the corporate world during the
      1970s, eventually achieving fad status. Its popularity continued during
      the 1980s as a result of economic changes in the United States, which
      included slowing domestic market growth and increasing foreign
      competition. Those changes forced many companies to seek the benefits
      offered by the matrix model.
    


        MATRIX BASICS
      


      FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION.
    

      Most organizational structures departmentalize the work force and other
      resources by one of two methods: by products or by functions. Functional
      organizations are segmented by key functions. For example, activities
      related to production, marketing, and finance might be grouped into three
      respective divisions. Within each division, moreover, activities would be
      departmentalized into subdepartments. The marketing division, for example,
      might encompass sales, advertising, and promotion departments.
    

      The chief advantage of functionally structured organizations is that they
      usually achieve a fairly efficient specialization of labor and are
      relatively easy for employees to comprehend. In addition, functional
      structures reduce duplication of work because responsibilities are clearly
      defined on a company-wide basis. However, functional division often causes
      departments to become short-sighted and provincial, leading to
      incompatible work styles and poor communication.
    

      DIVISIONAL ORGANIZATION.
    

      Companies that employ a product or divisional structure, by contrast,
      break the organization down into semiautonomous units and profit centers
      based on activities, or "projects," such as products,
      customers, or geography. Regardless of the project used to segment the
      company, each unit operates as a separate business. For example, a company
      might be broken down into southern, western, and eastern divisions. Or, it
      might create separate divisions for consumer, industrial, and
      institutional products. Again, within each product unit are subdivisions.
    

      One benefit of product or project departmentalization is that it
      facilitates expansion (because the company can easily add a new division
      to focus on a new profit opportunity without having to significantly alter
      existing systems). In addition, accountability is increased because
      divisional performance can be measured more easily. Furthermore,
      divisional structures permit decentralized decision making, which allows
      managers with specific expertise to make key decisions 
       in their area. The potential drawbacks to divisional structures include
      duplication of efforts in different departments and a lack of horizontal
      communication. In addition, divisional organizations, like functionally
      structured companies, may have trouble keeping all departments focused on
      an overall company goal.
    

      MATRIX ORGANIZATION.
    

      Matrix management structures combine functional and product
      departmentalization. They simultaneously organize part of a company along
      product or project lines and part of it around functional lines to get the
      advantages of both. For example, a diagram of a matrix model might show
      divisions, such as different product groups, along the top of a table (See
      Figure 1). Along the left side of the same table would be different
      functional departments, such as finance, marketing, and production. Within
      the matrix, each of the product groups would intersect with each of the
      functional groups, signifying a direct relationship between product teams
      and administrative divisions. In other words, each team of people assigned
      to manage a product group might have an individual(s) who also belonged to
      each of the functional departments, and vice-versa.
    

      Theoretically, managers of project groups and managers of functional
      groups have roughly equal authority within the company. As indicated by
      the matrix, many employees report to at least two managers. For instance,
      a member of the accounting department might be assigned to work with the
      consumer products division, and would report to managers of both
      departments. Generally, however, managers of functional areas and
      divisions report to a single authority, such as a president or vice
      president.
    

      Although all matrix structures entail some form of dual authority and
      multidisciplinary grouping, there are several variations. For example,
      Kenneth Knight identified three basic matrix management models:
      coordination, overlay, and secondment. Each of the models can be
      implemented in various forms that differ in attributes related to
      decision-making roles, relationships with outside suppliers and buyers,
      and other factors. Organizations choose different models based on such
      factors as competitive environments, industries, education and maturity
      level of the workforce, and existing corporate culture.
    

      In the coordination model, staff members remains part of their original
      departments (or the departments they would most likely belong to under a
      functional or product structure). Procedures are instituted to ensure
      cross-departmental cooperation and interaction towards the achievement of
      extra-departmental goals. In the overlay model, staff members officially
      become members of two groups, each of which has a separate manager. This
      model represents the undiluted matrix form described above. In the third
      version, the secondment model, individuals move from functional
      departments into project groups and back again, but may effectively belong
      to one or the other at different times.
    





            Figure 1
            
             Matrix Organizational Structure
          



      TEMPORARY VERSUS PERMANENT.
    

      As these examples and models suggest, matrix structures are more likely
      than other structures to exist on a temporary or ad hoc basis. Indeed,
      some scholars group matrix structures under a broader category of
      organizational forms called "adhocracies," or temporary work
      configurations, created to deal with a particular problem or project.
      Large-scale use of adhocracies dates to U.S. military practices during
      World War II, when the war effort required flexible teams of experts to be
      convened on short notice and delegated certain tasks, often without a
      great deal of micromanagement by military brass. Once the objectives were
      reached, the team would be disbanded and the members reassigned to other
      duties. A similar rationale and process exist in the business world, and
      thus many formal matrix structures fall into the ad hoc category.
    

      Permanent matrix structures are centered on more enduring aspects of
      business operations, such as product lines or processes. A common practice
      is to have a product or brand manager who is responsible for overseeing
      the development and production of an ongoing product, but staff who work
      on the product may also contribute to other products from time to time.
      This permanent set-up creates accountability, coordination, and perhaps
      most of all, continuity for the product as a whole, while enabling staff,
      who generally have a direct supervisor who is not a product manager, to be
      flexibly assigned where they are needed most.
    


        ADVANTAGES, DISADVANTAGES, AND
        
        APPLICATIONS
      


      ADVANTAGES.
    

      The cardinal advantage of a matrix structure is that it facilitates rapid
      response to change in two or more environments. For instance, a
      telecommunications company might be extremely concerned about both
      unforeseen geographic opportunities and limited capital. By
      departmentalizing its company with the financial function on one axis and
      the geographic areas on the other, it might benefit from having each of
      its geographic units intertwined with its finance department. For example,
      suppose that an opportunity to purchase the cellular telephone rights for
      a specific area arose. The matrix structure would allow the company to
      quickly determine if it had the capital necessary to purchase the license
      and develop the area, or if it should take advantage of an opportunity in
      another region.
    

      Matrix structures are flatter and more responsive than other types of
      structures because they permit more efficient exchanges of information.
      Because people from different departments are cooperating so closely, they
      are eager to share data that will help them achieve common goals. In
      effect, the entire organization becomes an information web; data is
      channeled both vertically and horizontally as people exchange technical
      knowledge, marketing data, product ideas, financial information to make
      decisions.
    

      In addition to speed and flexibility, matrix organization may result in a
      more efficient use of resources than other organic structures. This occurs
      because highly specialized employees and equipment are shared by
      departments. For example, if the expertise of a computer programmer is
      needed in another department, he or she can move to that department to
      solve its problems, rather than languishing on tasks of low priority as
      might happen in a nonmatrix setting.
    

      Other benefits of matrix management include improved motivation and more
      adept managers. Improved motivation results from decision-making within
      groups becoming more democratic and participatory because each member
      brings specialized knowledge to the table—and since employees have
      a direct impact on day-to-day decisions, they are more likely to
      experience higher levels of motivation and commitment to the goals of the
      departments to which they belong. More adept management is the result of
      top decision makers becoming more involved in, and thus better informed
      about, the day-to-day operations of the company. This involvement can also
      lead to improved long-term planning.
    

      DISADVANTAGES.
    

      Despite their many theoretical advantages, matrix management structures
      have been criticized as having a number of weaknesses. For instance, they
      are typically expensive to maintain, partly because of more complex
      reporting requirements. In addition, many workers become disturbed by the
      lack of a chain of command and a seeming inability to perceive who is in
      charge. Indeed, among the most common criticisms of matrix management is
      that it results in role ambiguity and conflict. For instance, a functional
      manager may tell a subordinate one thing, and then a product/project boss
      will tell him or her something different. As a result, companies that
      change from a comparatively bureaucratic structure to matrix management
      often experience high turnover and worker dissatisfaction.
    

      Supporting critics' derision of matrix management are several
      examples of companies that have implemented and later abandoned matrix
      structures. For example, one study showed that between 1961 and 1978 about
      one-quarter of all teaching hospitals in the United States moved to unit
      or matrix management structures. By the late 1970s, though, nearly
      one-third of those hospitals had rejected the concept, citing reasons such
      as high costs, excessive turnover, and interpersonal conflict. Although
      the hospital study suggested that matrix management was better suited to
      larger organizations, General Motors Corp.'s experience indicated
      otherwise. After a seven-year test of a matrix structure, GM jettisoned
      matrix management 
       in the 1980s in favor of a more traditional, product oriented
      organizational structure. It cited managers' lack of control over
      incentives as a primary shortcoming of the matrix system.
    

      Although matrix management was often viewed during the 1970s as a cure-all
      for organizational design, the perceived breadth of its potential for
      application has gradually diminished. In general, matrix structures are
      assumed to be most appropriate for larger corporations that operate in
      unique or fast-paced environments; a coal-mining company, for example,
      might be less likely to benefit from a matrix structure than would a
      pharmaceutical company. Matrix management also works best for
      organizations that are managed and staffed mostly by professionals or
      semi-professionals, e.g., engineers and scientists. Matrix management
      further requires a workforce that has a diverse set of skills and
      employees that have strong interpersonal abilities. Finally, matrix
      management is usually more effective when a project manager, who is
      technically working under the authority of a product and a functional
      boss, is given the authority to make critical decisions.
    

      Because of their limitations, matrix management structures frequently are
      integrated into an organization as one facet of a larger plan. For
      example, a research team organized to develop a new product might be
      placed in a division of the company that is set up as a matrix. After the
      initial stages of the project are completed, the ongoing management of the
      product might be moved to a division of the company that reflects a more
      conventional functional or product/project structure. Indeed, as evidenced
      by NASA's successes in the 1960s, matrix management is particularly
      effective in accomplishing "crash" and high-tech projects,
      such as those related to medical, energy research, aerospace, defense, and
      competitive threats.
    


        MATRIX STRUCTURE IN
        
        INTERNATIONAL SETTINGS
      


      A special and popular application of matrix management is in the overseas
      operations of an international firm. This is sometimes known as a three
      dimensional matrix when management intersects along product/market,
      function, and country lines. Under such an arrangement there is typically
      a worldwide product manager, a local or worldwide functional manager, and
      a country specific manager; however, many variations of the international
      matrix exist. The product manager is generally concerned with
      product-specific issues that cut across regional or national boundaries.
      Depending on the type of task and the company's preference, the
      functional manager may focus on international issues (e.g., worldwide
      finance) or local concerns (e.g., domestic finance). Finally, the country
      manager is concerned with all the implications—both product and
      function—of producing and/or marketing the goods or services in a
      particular locale.
    

      As with other uses of the matrix structure, the international format is
      not without its weaknesses. A particular concern is the role of ambiguity
      across international lines, and especially when it pits managers of
      different nationalities against one another. If the system is not handled
      carefully and the potential for cultural bias recognized by top
      management, it could lead to favoritism of some international managers
      while disenfranchising others, thereby defeating the purpose of a matrix
      structure. In addition, international matrix structures may be
      unacceptably inefficient and costly to maintain.
    


        CASE STUDY
      


      Bayer AG of Germany—the company best known in the United States for
      its Bayer aspirin products—is one of the largest and oldest
      chemical and health-care products companies in the world. Because of
      massive sales gains and increased activity overseas in the early 1980s,
      Bayer announced a reorganization in 1984. Bayer had been successful with a
      conventional organizational structure that was departmentalized by
      function. However, in response to new conditions the company wanted to
      create a structure that would allow it to achieve three primary goals: (1)
      shift management control from the then-West German parent company to its
      foreign divisions and subsidiaries; (2) restructure its business divisions
      to more clearly define their duties; and (3) flatten the organization, or
      empower lower level managers to assume more responsibility, so that top
      executives would have more time to plan strategy.
    

      Bayer selected a relatively diverse matrix management format to pursue its
      goals. It delineated all of its business activities into six groups under
      an umbrella company called Bayer World. Within each of the six groups were
      several subgroups made up of product categories such as dyestuffs, fibers,
      or chemicals. Likewise, each of its administrative and service functions
      were regrouped under Bayer World into one of several functions, such as
      human resources, marketing, plant administration, or finance. Furthermore,
      top managers who had formally headed functional groups were given
      authority over separate geographic regions, which, like the product
      groups, were supported by and entwined with the functional groups. The net
      effect of the reorganization was that the original nine functional
      departments were broken down into 19 multidisciplinary, interconnected
      business groups.
    

      After only one year of operation, Bayer management lauded the new matrix
      structure as a resounding success. Not only did matrix management allow
      the company to move toward its primary goals, but it had the added
      benefits of increasing its responsiveness to 
       change and emerging opportunities, and of helping Bayer to streamline

Management Buyouts
A management buyout occurs when incumbent management takes ownership of a firm by purchasing a sufficient amount of the firm's common stock. These transactions vary due to the conditions under which the firm is offered for sale and the method of financing employed by the managers.
Management Information Systems
Although management information systems (MISs) vary considerably in scope and function, they are all software applications used to support basic business management activities, such as reporting, planning, and controlling. More broadly, the MIS label is also applied to the computer systems that run this software, but strictly speaking an MIS is considered software rather than hardware. 
Management Science
Management science is the application of the scientific method to address problems and decisions that arise in the business community and other organizations, such as government and military institutions. This field of study, which is also commonly known as operations research (OR), operates on the understanding that business managers can make informed decisions only when they have access to scientifically acquired knowledge. 
Management Succession Planning
Management succession planning is the process of preparing an organization for a transition in leadership. Succession planning is helpful when a management change occurs due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the sudden death of a corporation's chief executive officer (CEO). 
Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting, or management accounting, is a set of practices and techniques aimed at providing managers with financial information to help them make decisions and maintain effective control over corporate resources. 
Managerial Economics
Decisions made by managers are crucial to the success or failure of a business. Roles played by business managers are becoming increasingly more challenging as complexity in the business world grows. 
Managing Machismo: U.S. Women vs. Foreign Men Abroad
Most Americans perceive macho behavior as a problem, but only as a "woman's problem." It occurs when men act in such fashion as to magnify their roles so as to diminish the roles of women. When U.S. 
Manufacturers' Representatives
Manufacturers' representatives are independent contractors who develop long-term relationships with their client companies (or "principals") to sell the latter's products. They do not function under the immediate supervision of the manufacturers they sell for; therefore the relationship is not like that between a boss and employee, but is a business-to-business relationship.
Market Research
Market research is the process of gathering and interpreting information about customers and potential customers. Research is needed because buying behaviors are sometimes difficult to predict or explain. 
Market Segmentation
Market segmentation is the process of identifying key groups or segments within the general market that share specific characteristics and consumer habits. Once the market is broken into segments, companies can develop advertising programs for each segment, focus advertising on one or two segments or niches, or develop new products to appeal to one or more of the segments. 
Market Value
Market value is the concept of how much something—a business, a piece of property, or anything of value—is presently worth under relatively free conditions of exchange. For tax and legal purposes, the standard definition of market value, or so-called fair market value (FMV), was articulated in the IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60, where it is equated with the price paid for a given property under the construct of a willing buyer and willing seller, both with full knowledge of pertinent facts, and neither being under a compulsion to act. 
Marketing
Marketing is a very general term that refers to the commercial functions involved in transferring goods and services from a producer to a consumer. It is commonly associated with endeavors such as branding, selling, and advertising, but it also encompasses activities and processes related to production, product development, distribution, and many other functions. 
Marketing Strategy
While all marketers do not agree on a common definition of marketing strategy, the term generally refers to a company plan that allocates resources in ways to generate profits by positioning products or services and targeting specific consumer groups. Marketing strategy focuses on long-term company objectives and involves planning marketing programs so that they help a company realize its goals. 
Matching Concept
The matching concept is an accounting principle that requires the identification and recording of expenses associated with revenue earned and recognized during the same accounting period. Accordingly, under the matching concept the expenses of a particular accounting period are the costs of the assets used to earn the revenue that is recognized in that period. 
Matrix Management and Structure
Matrix management is a technique of managing an organization (or, more commonly, part of an organization) through a series of dual-reporting relationships instead of a more traditional linear management structure. In contrast to most other organizational structures, which arrange managers and employees by function or product, matrix management combines functional and product departments in a dual authority system. 
MaxiMarketing
MaxiMarketing is set of marketing strategies developed by Stan Rapp and Thomas L. Collins in their 1987 book MaxiMarketing: The New Direction in Advertising, Promotion, and Marketing Strategy. 
Mercantilism
Mercantilism is a political and economic system that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries. It purports that a country's economic strength is directly related to the maintenance of a positive balance of trade. 
Merchandising
Merchandising is a branch of marketing theory and practice concerned with maximizing product sales by designing, packaging, pricing, and displaying goods in a way that stimulates higher sales volume. The underlying assumption in merchandising is that consumers may have a general need for (or interest in) a certain class of product, and it is the merchandiser's task to present the product in a way that best captures consumers' attention and persuades them that the product will fulfill their needs and wants. 
Mercosur
Mercosur is a customs union coordinating the economies of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Mercosur (in Portuguese, Mercosul) resulted from the 1991 Treaty of Asunci6n, and began taking effect on January 1, 1995. 
Mergers and Acquisitions
In general, mergers and other types of acquisitions are performed in the hopes of realizing an economic gain. For such a transaction to be justified, the two firms involved must be worth more together than they were apart. 
Metrics and Measurement
Metrics and measurement is comprised of two major bodies of knowledge, both studying the quantitative assessment of performance using test statistics. The first area includes the test measurement (primarily education-oriented), opinion survey, and market research survey industries. 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is a designation the U.S. government uses to refer to a region that, broadly speaking, consists of a city and its suburbs, plus any surrounding communities that are closely linked to the city economically and socially. 
Mexican Law
As a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that took effect on January 1, 1994, U.S. businesspeople began trading with Mexico's businesspeople, investing in business opportunities in Mexico, and establishing business facilities in Mexico in unprecedented numbers and ways. 
Mexico, Doing Business in
Mexico is, after Brazil, the second-largest economy in Latin America. At its high point, at the time the Canadian prime minister and the U.S. 
Microcomputers in Business
Commonly known as desktop computers or personal computers (PCs), microcomputers provide decentralized computing power for a wide number of business functions, especially those involving individual productivity tasks. The category "microcomputer," though somewhat of an anachronism now, distinguishes these machines from the traditionally larger, more powerful mainframes and minicomputers (also called midrange computers) that dominated business computing before the 1980s. 
Microeconomics
Microeconomics, or price theory, covers the economic activity of individual consumers or producers or groups of consumers and producers, and the markets in which they interact. Therefore, microeconomics is the study of buyers, sellers, prices, profits, and wages. 
Minority-Owned Businesses
Businesses owned by women and minorities in the United States represent a significant and rising percentage of all business enterprises. Estimates from the Census Bureau's Economic Census, which is conducted every five years, reckoned women's and minorities' share of U.S. 
Mixed Economy
The "mixture" in a mixed economy is one of private enterprise and public-sector controls and supports, of capitalism and socialism. That is to say, most economies that we think of as being "capitalist" are in fact mixed economies, including that of the United States.

Top-level managers in many of today’s leading corporations are losing control of their companies. The problem is not that they have misjudged the demands created by an increasingly complex environment and an accelerating rate of environmental change, nor even that they have failed to develop strategies appropriate to the new challenges. The problem is that their companies are organizationally incapable of carrying out the sophisticated strategies they have developed. Over the past 20 years, strategic thinking has far outdistanced organizational capabilities.
All through the 1980s, companies everywhere were redefining their strategies and reconfiguring their operations in response to such developments as the globalization of markets, the intensification of competition, the acceleration of product life cycles, and the growing complexity of relationships with suppliers, customers, employees, governments, even competitors. But as companies struggled with these changing environmental realities, many fell into one of two traps—one strategic, one structural.
The strategic trap was to implement simple, static solutions to complex and dynamic problems. The bait was often a consultant’s siren song promising to simplify or at least minimize complexity and discontinuity. Despite the new demands of overlapping industry boundaries and greatly altered value-added chains, managers were promised success if they would “stick to their knitting.” In a swiftly changing international political economy, they were urged to rein in dispersed overseas operations and focus on the triad markets, and in an increasingly intricate and sophisticated competitive environment, they were encouraged to choose between alternative generic strategies—low cost or differentiation.
Yet the strategic reality for most companies was that both their business and their environment really were more complex, while the proposed solutions were often simple, even simplistic. The traditional telephone company that stuck to its knitting was trampled by competitors who redefined their strategies in response to new technologies linking telecommunications, computers, and office equipment into a single integrated system. The packaged-goods company that concentrated on the triad markets quickly discovered that Europe, Japan, and the United States were the epicenters of global competitive activity, with higher risks and slimmer profits than more protected and less competitive markets such as Australia, Turkey, and Brazil. The consumer electronics company that adopted an either-or generic strategy found itself facing competitors able to develop cost and differentiation capabilities at the same time.
In recent years, as more and more managers recognized oversimplification as a strategic trap, they began to accept the need to manage complexity rather than seek to minimize it. This realization, however, led many into an equally threatening organizational trap when they concluded that the best response to increasingly complex strategic requirements was increasingly complex organizational structures.
The obvious organizational solution to strategies that required multiple, simultaneous management capabilities was the matrix structure that became so fashionable in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Its parallel reporting relation-ships acknowledged the diverse, conflicting needs of functional, product, and geographic management groups and provided a formal mechanism for resolving them. Its multiple information channels allowed the organization to capture and analyze external complexity. And its overlapping responsibilities were designed to combat parochialism and build flexibility into the company’s response to change.
In practice, however, the matrix proved all but unmanageable—especially in an international context. Dual reporting led to conflict and confusion; the proliferation of channels created informational logjams as a proliferation of committees and reports bogged down the organization; and overlapping responsibilities produced turf battles and a loss of accountability. Separated by barriers of distance, language, time, and culture, managers found it virtually impossible to clarify the confusion and resolve the conflicts.
In hindsight, the strategic and structural traps seem simple enough to avoid, so one has to wonder why so many experienced general managers have fallen into them. Much of the answer lies in the way we have traditionally thought about the general manager’s role. For decades, we have seen the general manager as chief strategic guru and principal organizational architect. But as the competitive climate grows less stable and less predictable, it is harder for one person alone to succeed in that great visionary role. Similarly, as formal, hierarchical structure gives way to networks of personal relationships that work through informal, horizontal communication channels, the image of top management in an isolated corner office moving boxes and lines on an organization chart becomes increasingly anachronistic. 
  
Paradoxically, as strategies and organizations become more complex and sophisticated, top-level general managers are beginning to replace their historical concentration on the grand issues of strategy and structure with a focus on the details of managing people and processes. The critical strategic requirement is not to devise the most ingenious and well-coordinated plan but to build the most viable and flexible strategic process; the key organizational task is not to design the most elegant structure but to capture individual capabilities and motivate the entire organization to respond cooperatively to a complicated and dynamic environment.
Building an Organization 
Although business thinkers have written a great deal about strategic innovation, they have paid far less attention to the accompanying organizational challenges. Yet many companies remain caught in the structural-complexity trap that paralyzes their ability to respond quickly or flexibly to the new strategic imperatives.
For those companies that adopted matrix structures, the problem was not in the way they defined the goal. They correctly recognized the need for a multi-dimensional organization to respond to growing external complexity. The problem was that they defined their organizational objectives in purely structural terms. Yet the term formal structure describes only the organization’s basic anatomy. Companies must also concern themselves with organizational physiology—the systems and relationships that allow the lifeblood of information to flow through the organization. They also need to develop a healthy organizational psychology—the shared norms, values, and beliefs that shape the way individual managers think and act.
The companies that fell into the organizational trap assumed that changing their formal structure (anatomy) would force changes in interpersonal relationships and decision processes (physiology), which in turn would reshape the individual attitudes and actions of managers (psychology).
But as many companies have discovered, reconfiguring the formal structure is a blunt and sometimes brutal instrument of change. A new structure creates new and presumably more useful managerial ties, but these can take months and often years to evolve into effective knowledge-generating and decision-making relationships. And because the new job requirements will frustrate, alienate, or simply overwhelm so many managers, changes in individual attitudes and behavior will likely take even longer.







As companies struggle to create organizational capabilities that reflect rather than diminish environmental complexity, good managers gradually stop searching for the ideal structural template to impose on the company from the top down. Instead, they focus on the challenge of building up an appropriate set of employee attitudes and skills and linking them together with carefully developed processes and relationships. In other words, they begin to focus on building the organization rather than simply on installing a new structure.
Indeed, the companies that are most successful at developing multi-dimensional organizations begin at the far end of the anatomy-physiology-psychology sequence. Their first objective is to alter the organizational psychology—the broad corporate beliefs and norms that shape managers’ perceptions and actions. Then, by enriching and clarifying communication and decision processes, companies reinforce these psychological changes with improvements in organizational physiology. Only later do they consolidate and confirm their progress by realigning organizational anatomy through changes in the formal structure.
No company we know of has discovered a quick or easy way to change its organizational psychology to reshape the understanding, identification, and commitment of its employees. But we found three principal characteristics common to those that managed the task most effectively: 
  
1. They developed and communicated a clear and consistent corporate vision.
2. They effectively managed human resource tools to broaden individual perspectives and to develop identification with corporate goals.
3. They integrated individual thinking and activities into the broad corporate agenda by a process we call co-option.
Building a Shared Vision 
Perhaps the main reason managers in large, complex companies cling to parochial attitudes is that their frame of reference is bounded by their specific responsibilities. The surest way to break down such insularity is to develop and communicate a clear sense of corporate purpose that extends into every corner of the company and gives context and meaning to each manager’s particular roles and responsibilities. We are not talking about a slogan, however catchy and pointed. We are talking about a company vision, which must be crafted and articulated with clarity, continuity, and consistency. We are talking about clarity of expression that makes company objectives understandable and meaningful; continuity of purpose that underscores their enduring importance; and consistency of application across business units and geographical boundaries that ensures uniformity throughout the organization.
Clarity 
There are three keys to clarity in a corporate vision: simplicity, relevance, and reinforcement. NEC’s integration of computers and communications—C&C—is probably the best single example of how simplicity can make a vision more powerful. Top management has applied the C&C concept so effectively that it describes the company’s business focus, defines its distinctive source of competitive advantage over large companies like IBM and AT&T, and summarizes its strategic and organizational imperatives.
The second key, relevance, means linking broad objectives to concrete agendas. When Wisse Dekker became CEO at Philips, his principal strategic concern was the problem of competing with Japan. He stated this challenge in martial terms—the U.S. had abandoned the battlefield; Philips was now Europe’s last defense against insurgent Japanese electronics companies. By focusing the company’s attention not only on Philips’s corporate survival but also on the protection of national and regional interests, Dekker heightened the sense of urgency and commitment in a way that legitimized cost-cutting efforts, drove an extensive rationalization of plant operations, and inspired a new level of sales achievements.
The third key to clarity is top management’s continual reinforcement, elaboration, and interpretation of the core vision to keep it from becoming obsolete or abstract. Founder Konosuke Matsushita developed a grand, 250- year vision for his company, but he also managed to give it immediate relevance. He summed up its overall message in the “Seven Spirits of Matsushita,” to which he referred constantly in his policy statements. Each January he wove the company’s one-year operational objectives into his overarching concept to produce an annual theme that he then captured in a slogan. For all the loftiness of his concept of corporate purpose, he gave his managers immediate, concrete guidance in implementing Matsushita’s goals.
Continuity 
Despite shifts in leadership and continual adjustments in short-term business priorities, companies must remain committed to the same core set of strategic objectives and organizational values. Without such continuity, unifying vision might as well be expressed in terms of quarterly goals. 
  
It was General Electric’s lack of this kind of continuity that led to the erosion of its once formidable position in electrical appliances in many countries. Over a period of 20 years and under successive CEOs, the company’s international consumer-product strategy never stayed the same for long. From building locally responsive and self-sufficient “mini-GEs” in each market, the company turned to a policy of developing low-cost offshore sources, which eventually evolved into a de facto strategy of international outsourcing. Finally, following its acquisition of RCA, GE’s consumer electronics strategy made another about-face and focused on building centralized scale to defend domestic share. Meanwhile, the product strategy within this shifting business emphasis was itself unstable. The Brazilian subsidiary, for example, built its TV business in the 1960s until it was told to stop; in the early 1970s, it emphasized large appliances until it was denied funding, then it focused on housewares until the parent company sold off that business. In two decades, GE utterly dissipated its dominant franchise in Brazil’s electrical products market.
Unilever, by contrast, made an enduring commitment to its Brazilian subsidiary, despite volatile swings in Brazil’s business climate. Company chairman Floris Maljers emphasized the importance of looking past the latest political crisis or economic downturn to the long-term business potential. “In those parts of the world,” he remarked, “you take your management cues from the way they dance. The samba method of management is two steps forward then one step back.” Unilever built—two steps forward and one step back—a profitable $300 million business in a rapidly growing economy with 130 million consumers, while its wallflower competitors never ventured out onto the floor.







Consistency 
The third task for top management in communicating strategic purpose is to ensure that everyone in the company shares the same vision. The cost of inconsistency can be horrendous. It always produces confusion and, in extreme cases, can lead to total chaos, with different units of the organization pursuing agendas that are mutually debilitating.
Philips is a good example of a company that, for a time, lost its consistency of corporate purpose. As a legacy of its wartime decision to give some overseas units legal autonomy, management had long experienced difficulty persuading North American Philips (NAP) to play a supportive role in the parent company’s global strategies. The problem came to a head with the introduction of Philips’s technologically first-rate videocassette recording system, the V2000. Despite considerable pressure from world headquarters in the Netherlands, NAP refused to launch the system, arguing that Sony’s Beta system and Matsushita’s VHS format were too well established and had cost, feature, and system-support advantages Philips couldn’t match. Relying on its legal independence and managerial autonomy, NAP management decided instead to source products from its Japanese competitors and market them under its Magnavox brand name. As a result, Philips was unable to build the efficiency and credibility it needed to challenge Japanese dominance of the VCR business.
Most inconsistencies involve differences between what managers of different operating units see as the company’s key objectives. Sometimes, however, different corporate leaders transmit different views of overall priorities and purpose. When this stems from poor communication, it can be fixed. When it’s a result of fundamental disagreement, the problem is serious indeed, as illustrated by ITT’s problems in developing its strategically vital System 12 switching equipment. Continuing differences between the head of the European organization and the company’s chief technology officer over the location and philosophy of the development effort led to confusion and conflict throughout the company. The result was disastrous. ITT had difficulty transferring vital technology across its own unit boundaries and so was irreparably late introduc-ing this key product to a rapidly changing global market. These problems eventually led the company to sell off its core telecommunications business to a competitor.
But formulating and communicating a vision—no matter how clear, enduring, and consistent—cannot succeed unless individual employees under-stand and accept the company’s stated goals and objectives. Problems at this level are more often related to receptivity than to communication. The develop-ment of individual understanding and acceptance is a challenge for a company’s human resource practices.
Developing Human Resources 
While top managers universally recognize their responsibility for developing and allocating a company’s scarce assets and resources, their focus on finance and technology often overshadows the task of developing the scarcest resource of all—capable managers. But if there is one key to regaining control of companies that operate in fast-changing environments, it is the ability of top management to turn the perceptions, capabilities, and relationships of individual managers into the building blocks of the organization.
One pervasive problem in companies whose leaders lack this ability—or fail to exercise it—is getting managers to see how their specific responsibilities relate to the broad corporate vision. Growing external complexity and strategic sophistication have accelerated the growth of a cadre of specialists who are physically and organizationally isolated from each other, and the task of dealing with their consequent parochialism should not be delegated to the clerical staff that administers salary structures and benefit programs. Top managers inside and outside the human resource function must be leaders in the recruitment, development, and assignment of the company’s vital human talent. 
  
Recruitment and Selection 
The first step in successfully managing complexity is to tap the full range of available talent. It is a serious mistake to permit historical imbalances in the nationality or functional background of the management group to constrain hiring or subsequent promotion. In today’s global marketplace, domestically oriented recruiting limits a company’s ability to capitalize on its worldwide pool of management skill and biases its decision-making processes.
After decades of routinely appointing managers from its domestic operations to key positions in overseas subsidiaries, Procter & Gamble realized that the practice not only worked against sensitivity to local cultures—a lesson driven home by several marketing failures in Japan—but also greatly under-utilized its pool of high-potential non-American managers. (Fortunately, our studies turned up few companies as shortsighted as one that made overseas assignments on the basis of poor performance, because foreign markets were assumed to be “not as tough as the domestic environment.”)
Not only must companies enlarge the pool of people available for key positions, they must also develop new criteria for choosing those most likely to succeed. Because past success is no longer a sufficient qualification for increasingly subtle, sensitive, and unpredictable senior-level tasks, top management must become involved in a more discriminating selection process. At Matsushita, top management selects candidates for international assignments on the basis of a comprehensive set of personal characteristics, expressed for simplicity in the acronym SMILE: specialty (the needed skill, capability, or knowledge); management ability (particularly motivational ability); international flexibility (willingness to learn and ability to adapt); language facility; and endeavor (vitality, perseverance in the face of difficulty). These attributes are remarkably similar to those targeted by NEC and Philips, where top executives also are involved in the senior-level selection process.
Training and Development 
Once the appropriate top-level candidates have been identified, the next challenge is to develop their potential. The most successful development efforts have three aims that take them well beyond the skill-building objectives of classic training programs: to inculcate a common vision and shared values; to broaden management perspectives and capabilities; and to develop contacts and shape management relationships.
To build common vision and values, white-collar employees at Matsushita spend a good part of their first six months in what the company calls “cultural and spiritual training.” They study the company credo, the “Seven Spirits of Matsushita,” and the philosophy of Konosuke Matsushita. Then they learn how to translate these internalized lessons into daily behavior and even operational decisions. Culture-building exercises as intensive as Matsushita’s are sometimes dismissed as innate Japanese practices that would not work in other societies, but in fact, Philips has a similar entry-level training practice (called “organization cohesion training”), as does Unilever (called, straight-forwardly, “indoctrination”).
The second objective—broadening management perspectives—is essentially a matter of teaching people how to manage complexity instead of merely to make room for it. To reverse a long and unwieldy tradition of running its operations with two- and three-headed management teams of separate technical, commercial, and sometimes administrative specialists, Philips asked its training and development group to de-specialize top management trainees. By supplementing its traditional menu of specialist courses and functional programs with more intensive general management training, Philips was able to begin replacing the ubiquitous teams with single business heads who also appreciated and respected specialist points of view.
The final aim—developing contacts and relationships—is much more than an incidental byproduct of good management development, as the comments of a senior personnel manager at Unilever suggest: “By bringing managers from different countries and businesses together at Four Acres [Unilever’s international management-training college], we build contacts and create bonds that we could never achieve by other means. The company spends as much on training as it does on R&D not only because of the direct effect it has on upgrading skills and knowledge but also because it plays a central role in indoctrinating managers into a Unilever club where personal relationships and informal contacts are much more powerful than the formal systems and structures.”
Career-Path Management 
Although recruitment and training are critically important, the most effective companies recognize that the best way to develop new perspectives and thwart parochialism in their managers is through personal experience. By moving selected managers across functions, businesses, and geographic units, a company encourages cross-fertilization of ideas as well as the flexibility and breadth of experience that enable managers to grapple with complexity and come out on top. 
  
Unilever has long been committed to the development of its human resources as a means of attaining durable competitive advantage. As early as the 1930s, the company was recruiting and developing local employees to replace the parent-company managers who had been running most of its overseas subsidiaries. In a practice that came to be known as “-ization,” the company committed itself to the Indianization of its Indian company, the Australization of its Australian company, and so on.
Although delighted with the new talent that began working its way up through the organization, management soon realized that by reducing the transfer of parent-company managers abroad, it had diluted the powerful glue that bound diverse organizational groups together and linked dispersed operations. The answer lay in formalizing a second phase of the -ization process. While continuing with Indianization, for example, Unilever added programs aimed at the “Unileverization” of its Indian managers.
In addition to bringing 300 to 400 managers to Four Acres each year, Unilever typically has 100 to 150 of its most promising overseas managers on short- and long-term job assignments at corporate headquarters. This policy not only brings fresh, close-to-the-market perspectives into corporate decision making but also gives the visiting managers a strong sense of Unilever’s strategic vision and organizational values. In the words of one of the expatriates in the corporate offices, “The experience initiates you into the Unilever Club and the clear norms, values, and behaviors that distinguish our people—so much so that we really believe we can spot another Unilever manager anywhere in the world.”
Furthermore, the company carefully transfers most of these high-potential individuals through a variety of different functional, product, and geographic positions, often rotating every two or three years. Most important, top management tracks about 1,000 of these people—some 5% of Unilever’s total management group—who, as they move through the company, forge an informal network of contacts and relationships that is central to Unilever’s decision-making and information-exchange processes.
Widening the perspectives and relationships of key managers as Unilever has done is a good way of developing identification with the broader corporate mission. But a broad sense of identity is not enough. To maintain control of its global strategies, Unilever must secure a strong and lasting individual commitment to corporate visions and objectives. In effect, it must co-opt individual energies and ambitions into the service of corporate goals.
Co-Opting Management Efforts 
As organizational complexity grows, managers and management groups tend to become so specialized and isolated and to focus so intently on their own immediate operating responsibilities that they are apt to respond parochially to intrusions on their organizational turf, even when the overall corporate interest is at stake. A classic example, described earlier, was the decision by North American Philips’s consumer electronics group to reject the parent company’s VCR system.
At about the same time, Philips, like many other companies, began experimenting with ways to convert managers’ intellectual understanding of the corporate vision—in Philips’s case, an almost evangelical determination to defend Western electronics against the Japanese—into a binding personal commitment. Philips concluded that it could co-opt individuals and organizational groups into the broader vision by inviting them to contribute to the corporate agenda and then giving them direct responsibility for implementation.
In the face of intensifying Japanese competition, Philips knew it had to improve coordination in its consumer electronics among its fiercely independent national organizations. In strengthening the central product divisions, however, Philips did not want to deplete the enterprise or commitment of its capable national management teams. 
  
The company met these conflicting needs with two cross-border initiatives. First, it created a top-level World Policy Council for its video business that included key managers from strategic markets—Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Philips knew that its national companies’ long history of independence made local managers reluctant to take orders from Dutch headquarters in Eindhoven—often for good reason, because much of the company’s best market knowledge and technological expertise resided in its offshore units. Through the council, Philips co-opted their support for company decisions about product policy and manufacturing location.
Second, in a more powerful move, Philips allocated global responsibilities to units that previously had been purely national in focus. Eindhoven gave NAP the leading role in the development of Philips’s projection television and asked it to coordinate development and manufacture of all Philips television sets for North America and Asia. The change in the attitude of NAP managers was dramatic.
A senior manager in NAP’s consumer electronics business summed up the feelings of U.S. managers: “At last, we are moving out of the dependency relationship with Eindhoven that was so frustrating to us.” Co-option had transformed the defensive, territorial attitude of NAP managers into a more collaborative mind-set. They were making important contributions to global corporate strategy instead of looking for ways to subvert it.
In 1987, with much of its TV set production established in Mexico, the president of NAP’s consumer electronics group told the press, “It is the commonality of design that makes it possible for us to move production globally. We have splendid cooperation with Philips in Eindhoven.” It was a statement no NAP manager would have made a few years earlier, and it perfectly captured how effectively Philips had co-opted previously isolated, even adversarial, managers into the corporate agenda.
The Matrix in the Manager’s Mind 
Since the end of World War II, corporate strategy has survived several generations of painful transformation and has grown appropriately agile and athletic. Unfortunately, organizational development has not kept pace, and managerial attitudes lag even farther behind. As a result, corporations now commonly design strategies that seem impossible to implement, for the simple reason that no one can effectively implement third-generation strategies through second-generation organizations run by first-generation managers.
Today the most successful companies are those where top executives recognize the need to manage the new environmental and competitive demands by focusing less on the quest for an ideal structure and more on developing the abilities, behavior, and performance of individual managers. Change succeeds only when those assigned to the new transnational and interdependent tasks understand the overall goals and are dedicated to achieving them.
One senior executive put it this way: “The challenge is not so much to build a matrix structure as it is to create a matrix in the minds of our managers.” The inbuilt conflict in a matrix structure pulls managers in several directions at once. Developing a matrix of flexible perspectives and relationships within each manager’s mind, however, achieves an entirely different result. It lets individuals make the judgments and negotiate the trade-offs that drive the organization toward a shared strategic objective.

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.
