Backup & Recovery









Backup and Recovery
Your data — protected your way.
Enterprise data is anything but uniform. Which is why your data protection, backup and recovery solution needs to cover the full range of data sources, file types, storage media and backup modes — from snapshots to streaming.
With all that diversity, the last thing you want is to maintain a separate point solution for each distinct backup and recovery requirement. With Commvault, you don’t have to. Our integrated, automated data protection approach gives you a single, complete view of all your stored data no matter where it is — on-premises or in the cloud.






Back up your databases, files, applications, endpoints and VMs with maximum efficiency according to data type and recovery profile. Integrate hardware snapshots. Optimize storage with deduplication. Recover your data rapidly and easily, whenever you need to, and leverage reports to continually improve your backup and recovery processes. Commvault software eliminates the separate data silos associated with traditional backup, archive and reporting products — in a vendor neutral solution that frees you from lock-in while reducing infrastructure requirements.












An industry leader in enterprise backup and recovery
For our reliability, consistency and ability to innovate, Commvault has been named an industry leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Backup Software and Integrated Appliances for six years in a row.



6X Industry leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant













VMs and the cloud
Cloud options seem to be the only thing growing faster than your data. Connecting your backups to the cloud won’t be an issue with Commvault. Backup and recover your virtual machines, structured and unstructured data with speed and scale – and remain agile by easily moving data between clouds to avoid lock-in.
More than
25
cloud storage platforms are supported by Commvault.

Learn more about VM and cloud platforms







Databases
Some organizations are lucky enough to be standardized on a single DBMS, others are supporting databases ranging from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL. No matter where you fit, Commvault’s single solution will simplify backup and disaster recovery across your databases — from local servers to the cloud.

Learn more about databases









Email and collaboration
Instead of spending your time searching for and recovering one user’s lost or deleted emails, give your users self-service access to search and restore messages without IT intervention. That frees you to think about more strategic challenges like archiving and moving to the cloud — just a couple more things we can help you with.

Learn more about email and collaboration












ERP software
Commvault makes it easy to protect your mission-critical SAP and Oracle ERP applications. Our single solution provides integrated, comprehensive data management and protection for your entire applications environment — helping you reduce complexities and keep up with increasing performance demands.




Learn more about enterprise applications













Files
With Commvault backup and recovery, we don’t stop at file servers and storage arrays. Even business files stored in third-party file sharing applications can be protected in a secure, searchable and centralized virtual repository.

Learn more about file protection and recovery









Endpoints
Commvault enables the data created and stored on laptops, desktops and more to be accessible anytime, anywhere — with a self-service recovery portal accessible from any web browser or mobile device.

Learn more about endpoint data protection












Deduplication built in
Data continues to grow, but with deduplication you can get control of its incredible growth. Rather than requiring a separate hardware deduplication appliance, we’ve built deduplication into our software, giving you the flexibility to decide what and where to deduplicate. And, if want the convenience of an appliance, we offer that, too.

Up to
90%
reduced network backup traffic

Learn more about source-side deduplication











Backup appliances
Pre-configured backup appliances combine our backup and recovery software with storage hardware from industry leaders NetApp and Fujitsu in one integrated package. Easy to buy, deploy and manage, they’re a flexible way to introduce our platform into your environment.

non-exclusive license to use the Software under the terms and conditions stated 
herein. You agree that all updates, enhancements, maintenance releases, patches, 
bug-fixes or other modifications to the Software provided to You, on a when and 
if available basis, shall be governed by the terms and conditions, including the 
limited warranty, exclusive remedies and limitations of liability provisions, 
contained in this EULA, or the then-current version of this EULA. This EULA may 
be amended from time to time by CommVault, in its discretion, and will be made 
available at

www.commvault.com.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the license granted 
herein shall be perpetual provided You comply with the terms hereof. This EULA 
shall be in effect until terminated except as expressly otherwise provided 
herein. You may terminate this EULA at any time by destroying all copies of 
Software and corresponding documentation. This EULA will terminate immediately

EULA. Upon termination, You must destroy all copies of Software in Your 
possession or control.  
You may:

in numbers equal to the number of licenses purchased for all items, or in the 
event You are licensing the Software on a capacity basis, up to the maximum 
capacity purchased; (ii) make copies of the Software, documentation or other 
user information accompanying the Software solely for back-up purposes, provided 
such back-up copies are only utilized as a replacement for the original copy on 
the same computer that the Software was previously installed; and, (iii) make a 
copy of or print documentation provided in electronic form for Your internal use 
only, and You may use CommVault trademarks solely for these purposes, but You 
must incorporate all patent, copyright, trademark and other notices included on 
the materials on any copies or partial copies that You make. 
 
You may not: 
(i) make a copy of any of the Software for any purpose not explicitly permitted 
herein; (ii) provide commercial hosting services, sell, sublicense, rent, loan

Software solely for Your internal data center operations and to restrict any 
access to the Software, documentation, or other user information accompanying 
the Software only to those of your employees having a demonstrable need to have 
such access for your internal data processing operations.  You agree that you 
shall not permit any access to the Software, documentation, or other user 
information accompanying the Software to any person engaged in product research, 
development, support, sales, marketing, or other functions not directly related 
to your internal data processing operations.  You also agree not to use the 
Software, documentation, or user information accompanying the Software to 
assist, directly or indirectly, in the development or design of any computer 
hardware or software program including, but not limited to, a program that 
provides or is intended to provide or include a similar feature or functionality 
as the Software, or any conversion utility or aid relating to the Software 
intended to enable or facilitate a user�s conversion from the use of the 
Software to an alternative program. Any software CommVault and/or its licensors 
may provide You as part of maintenance and support services are governed by this 
EULA, unless separate terms are provided.  This EULA does not obligate CommVault 
and/or its licensors to provide any maintenance and support services or to 
support any Software provided as part of those services. If support services are 
provided, they shall be provided in accordance with CommVault�s then current 
policies, as such may be amended from time to time.  In the event You elect to 
purchase maintenance and support services, You must purchase such maintenance 
and support services for all of the licensed Software in Your entire 
environment.  Such maintenance and support services shall begin on the date 
Software is shipped to You.  Personal health information, personal financial 
information, or any other personally 
identifiable information is not
necessary for CommVault�s provision of 
services. You agree that You will not provide any
such information to CommVault. 

You agree that 
CommVault and/or its licensors may, for business purposes, collect, process, and 
use technical information gathered as part of any product maintenance and 
support services provided to You related to the Software and any other technical 
information You provide to CommVault provided that such information does not 
personally identify You. 
All title and 
intellectual property rights in and to the Software, and any copies You are 
permitted to make herein, are owned by CommVault and/or its licensors and is 
protected by United States and other country patent, copyright, trade secret, 
and other laws and by international treaty provisions. Such licensors, in 
addition to any other rights or remedies available to them, are third party 
beneficiaries of this EULA for their respective software and may have the right 
to enforce such terms against You. This Software is licensed, not sold. 
 The purchase of a license to the Software is final, non-returnable and 
non-refundable.  Acceptance of the Software occurs upon shipment by CommVault or 
its licensors. No rights are granted to You other than a license to use the 
Software upon the terms expressly set forth in this EULA. The structure, 
sequence, organization and source code of the Software are valuable trade 
secrets of CommVault and/or its licensors. The export of the Software may be 
restricted by the export control laws of the United States of America and other 
countries. You agree to comply strictly with all such regulations and 
acknowledge that You have the responsibility to obtain licenses to export, 
re-export, or import Software. This EULA shall be governed by the laws of New 
Jersey, USA, without regard to any provisions concerning the applicability of 
the laws of other jurisdictions. This EULA is the complete and exclusive 
statement of Your agreement with CommVault with respect to the subject matter 
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements. This EULA supersedes all terms and 
conditions contained in any purchase order, order acknowledgment form, invoice 
or other business form submitted by You. No advertisements, catalogues or other 
publications or statements, whether written or oral, regarding the performance 
of the Software licensed under this EULA shall form part of this EULA. If any 
provision of this EULA is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this EULA shall remain in 
full force and effect. 
In the event You 
license the Software on a capacity basis, if you exceed the maximum capacity 
purchased, the Software may cease to operate normally and/or performance may be 
impaired; provided however that reducing Your usage to the purchased capacity 
level or purchasing additional capacity will return the Software to its normal 
operation. Any excess capacity usage above the purchased maximum shall entitle 
CommVault to invoice You for licensed capacity and maintenance and support 
amounts owed, and if You fail to pay for the excess usage, CommVault shall be 
entitled to any self-help or other remedies available. You shall provide 
CommVault with any usage reports immediately upon request (and You shall not 
interfere with any automated reporting features) in order to enable CommVault to 
verify Your capacity usage.
To ensure 
compliance with this EULA, You agree that upon reasonable notice, CommVault or 
CommVault�s authorized representative shall have the right to inspect and audit 
Your installation and use of the Software.  Any such inspection or audit shall 
be conducted during regular business hours at your facilities or 
electronically.  Any information obtained during the course of such audit will 
be used by CommVault solely for the enforcement of CommVault�s rights under this 
EULA and applicable law.  If such audits disclose that you have installed, 
accessed, used, or otherwise permitted access to the Software in a manner that 
is not permitted by the terms of this EULA, then CommVault may terminate this 
EULA immediately and You shall reimburse CommVault for any unpaid license fees 
and all reasonable expenses related to such audit.  Nothing in this section 
shall be deemed to limit any legal or equitable remedies available to CommVault 
for violation of this EULA or applicable law.
Any reports regarding Your 
use of the Software and any other usage information, results, comments, or 
suggestions provided by You to CommVault regarding the Software (collectively, 
the �Feedback�) shall be deemed non-confidential to You. By providing Feedback, 
You grant and assign to CommVault, under Your intellectual property rights and 
other ownership rights, a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and 
non-exclusive license, with the right to sublicense to CommVault licensees and 
customers, the rights to use and disclose the Feedback in any manner CommVault 
chooses, and to display, perform, copy, make, have made, use, sell, and 
otherwise dispose of CommVault�s products embodying the Feedback in any manner 
and via any media CommVault or its licensees choose, without obligation to You. 
To the extent that You may acquire by operation of law or equity, any right, 
title, or interest, including any intellectual property rights, in or to the 
Feedback, or any modifications, or developments related thereto, You hereby 
assign to CommVault Your entire right, title, and interest, including all 
intellectual property rights, therein and thereto, and agree to execute any 
necessary documents as reasonably required and requested by CommVault in 
connection with the foregoing.  The above provisions and rights granted 
regarding title and intellectual property rights associated with the Software 
and the Feedback shall survive termination of this EULA.
 
If the Software is provided 
to You electronically, You may not request, and CommVault is under no obligation 
to provide, physical delivery of any Software or media. You agree to be 
responsible for all taxes and any penalties and/or interest associated with Your 
purchase or use of the Software. You understand and agree that subsequent 
Software deliveries may not be eligible for electronic delivery, and in the 
event physical delivery is made, You shall be solely responsible for any taxes 
on that, or any prior, purchase. You represent and warrant that neither You, nor 
any of Your affiliates, have received any physical media from CommVault 
containing the Software. In the event that any taxing or governmental authority 
makes a claim against CommVault for taxes, interest, penalties or other payments 
related to the delivery and/or purchase by You of the Software, You agree to 
indemnify and hold CommVault harmless from and against all such claims, 
proceedings, actions and liabilities associated therewith.
All rights not 
expressly granted hereunder are expressly reserved by CommVault.

conditions, warranties, limitations and remedies contain an allocation risk

Products[edit]
Commvault software is an enterprise-level data platform that contains modules to back up, restore, archive, replicate, and search data. It is built from the ground-up on a single platform and unified code base.
Data is protected by installing agent software on the physical or virtual hosts, which use operating system or application native APIs to protect data in a consistent state. Production data is processed by the agent software on client computers and backed up through a data manager, the MediaAgent, to disk, tape, or cloud storage. All data management activity in the environment is tracked by a centralized server, the CommServe, and can be managed by administrators through a central user interface. End users can access protected data using web browsers and mobile devices.
Key features of the software platform include:

Simplified management through a single console: view, manage, and access all functions and all data and information across the enterprise.
Multiple protection methods including backup and archive, snapshot management, replication, and content indexing for eDiscovery.
Efficient storage management using deduplication for disk and tape.
Integrated with the industry's top storage arrays to automate the creation of indexed, application-aware hardware snapshot copies across multi-vendor storage environments.
Complete virtual infrastructure management that supports many hypervisors, including VMware and Hyper-V.
Advanced security capabilities to limit access to critical data, to provide granular management capabilities, and to provide single sign-on access for Active Directory users.
Policy-based data management, which transcends the limitations of legacy backup products by managing data based on business needs and not on physical location.
Self-service for end users, which allows them to protect, find, and recover their own data using common tools such as web browsers, mobile devices, Microsoft Outlook, and File Explorer.

Commvault software also includes customized data management solutions for managed backup services, healthcare, and big data environments.
Key partners[edit]
Commvault partners include technology vendors such as: AWS, Microsoft, Nutanix, Fujitsu, HPE, Hitachi Data Systems, NEC, NetApp, Nimble Storage, Oracle, Pure Storage, SAP and VMware.

Yes, data is growing exponentially. And yes, technologies like Cloud, Virtualization, Mobility, BYOD, and a movement to a shared services model continue to present new challenges. But new challenges are what progress is all about. And CommVault has proven that the key to meeting the challenges of today and tomorrow is to anticipate and innovate. We call it “Solving Forward.” And it’s time to discover how it can transform your organization.Data is good. There, we said it. At a time when many in the business world are wringing their hands over the explosion of data from an ever-growing variety of sources, some organizations are seeing a big opportunity. These organizations are mining customer data for deep insights that drive revenue and growth. They are transforming machine data into valuable information. They are shaping healthcare data into better patient outcomes. And they are turning research data into answers to some of the world’s most vexing problems. They are the 17,500 customers of CommVault. With the release of our breakthrough Simpana® 10 CommVault can help you protect, manage, and access information like never before.

Through a single  pane of glass, you can view, manage, and access  all functions and all data across your enterprise. Our  console is simple, efficient, and comprehensive. So it  requires less time, labor, and budget to operate.  Simplify Management  With Simpana software, you can protect and manage data from virtual and physical servers, applications, NAS shares, cloud-based infrastructures, and mobile  devices. Simply and easily . Automate Key Processes - Simpana software enables policy-based automation, while role-based access ensures secure management. It also provides built-in alerts and reporting, for easier oversight of your data management operations. Work Smarter - Simpana IntelliSnap™ technology integrates with nearly all of the top storage arrays. So you can easily automate the creation of indexed, application-aware hardware snapshot copies. And, you can accelerate data protection and recovery. Streamline Operations -  With backup, archive, and reporting built into a single platform, the Simpana OnePass™ feature uniquely performs these operations from a single collection of data. Plus, by leveraging built-in source-side deduplication, Simpana software ensures that only unique data blocks are transferred over the network and stored on media. Ensure Accessibility - All Simpana-managed data resides within the ContentStore — a safe, efficient, intelligent and accessible virtual repository of all corporate data. You set the policies, and ContentStore intelligently automates the process. Whether you need copies for disaster recovery or regulatory compliance, data within the ContentStore is secure, deduplicated, and application-aware for when you need it.

Products[edit]
Commvault software is an enterprise-level data platform that contains modules to back up, restore, archive, replicate, and search data. It is built from the ground-up on a single platform and unified code base.
Data is protected by installing agent software on the physical or virtual hosts, which use operating system or application native APIs to protect data in a consistent state. Production data is processed by the agent software on client computers and backed up through a data manager, the MediaAgent, to disk, tape, or cloud storage. All data management activity in the environment is tracked by a centralized server, the CommServe, and can be managed by administrators through a central user interface. End users can access protected data using web browsers and mobile devices.
Key features of the software platform include:

Simplified management through a single console: view, manage, and access all functions and all data and information across the enterprise.
Multiple protection methods including backup and archive, snapshot management, replication, and content indexing for eDiscovery.
Efficient storage management using deduplication for disk and tape.
Integrated with the industry's top storage arrays to automate the creation of indexed, application-aware hardware snapshot copies across multi-vendor storage environments.
Complete virtual infrastructure management that supports many hypervisors, including VMware and Hyper-V.
Advanced security capabilities to limit access to critical data, to provide granular management capabilities, and to provide single sign-on access for Active Directory users.
Policy-based data management, which transcends the limitations of legacy backup products by managing data based on business needs and not on physical location.
Self-service for end users, which allows them to protect, find, and recover their own data using common tools such as web browsers, mobile devices, Microsoft Outlook, and File Explorer.

Commvault software also includes customized data management solutions for managed backup services, healthcare, and big data environments.
Key partners[edit]
Commvault partners include technology vendors such as: AWS, Microsoft, Nutanix, Fujitsu, HPE, Hitachi Data Systems, NEC, NetApp, Nimble Storage, Oracle, Pure Storage, SAP and VMware.

Products[edit]
Commvault software is an enterprise-level data platform that contains modules to back up, restore, archive, replicate, and search data. It is built from the ground-up on a single platform and unified code base.
Data is protected by installing agent software on the physical or virtual hosts, which use operating system or application native APIs to protect data in a consistent state. Production data is processed by the agent software on client computers and backed up through a data manager, the MediaAgent, to disk, tape, or cloud storage. All data management activity in the environment is tracked by a centralized server, the CommServe, and can be managed by administrators through a central user interface. End users can access protected data using web browsers and mobile devices.
Key features of the software platform include:

Simplified management through a single console: view, manage, and access all functions and all data and information across the enterprise.
Multiple protection methods including backup and archive, snapshot management, replication, and content indexing for eDiscovery.
Efficient storage management using deduplication for disk and tape.
Integrated with the industry's top storage arrays to automate the creation of indexed, application-aware hardware snapshot copies across multi-vendor storage environments.
Complete virtual infrastructure management that supports many hypervisors, including VMware and Hyper-V.
Advanced security capabilities to limit access to critical data, to provide granular management capabilities, and to provide single sign-on access for Active Directory users.
Policy-based data management, which transcends the limitations of legacy backup products by managing data based on business needs and not on physical location.
Self-service for end users, which allows them to protect, find, and recover their own data using common tools such as web browsers, mobile devices, Microsoft Outlook, and File Explorer.

Commvault software also includes customized data management solutions for managed backup services, healthcare, and big data environments.
Key partners[edit]
Commvault partners include technology vendors such as: AWS, Microsoft, Nutanix, Fujitsu, HPE, Hitachi Data Systems, NEC, NetApp, Nimble Storage, Oracle, Pure Storage, SAP and VMware.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
