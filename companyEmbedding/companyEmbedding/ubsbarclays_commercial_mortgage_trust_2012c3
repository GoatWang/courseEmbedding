      Fitch Affirms UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4
    





November 03, 2016 03:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of UBS-Barclays Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2012-C4. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on overall stable performance since issuance. 
      As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 5.2% to $1.381 billion from $1.456 billion 
      at issuance. Sixteen loans (14.8% of the pool) are currently on the 
      servicer watchlist; however, nine of the loans have issues related to 
      minor deferred maintenance but not considered Fitch loans of concern. 
      Seven (8.6%) of the watchlist loans, which have occupancy and/or 
      performance issues are Fitch loans of concern. Eight loans (2.9%) are 
      fully defeased.
    

      Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the 
      pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 
      2.1% increase since last year's review and an 8.1% increase since 
      issuance for reporting loans. All loans in the pool are current as of 
      the October 2016 distribution and no loans are in special servicing.
    

      Loan Diversity: The largest 10 loans account for 48.6% of the pool by 
      balance. It was also noted at issuance that the loan concentration index 
      (LCI) was lower than average for this transaction compared to the 2012 
      peer set.
    

      Single Tenant Exposure: Two of the 10 largest assets, representing 13.1% 
      of the pool, are occupied by a single tenant or present exposure in 
      excess of 80% of the NRA to a single tenant, creating idiosyncratic risk 
      to property performance.
    

      Loan Amortization: Six loans, representing nearly 19% of the collateral 
      balance, are full-term interest-only loans, above the 2012 average of 
      13%, and one loan (0.5%) has an anticipated repayment date (ARD). The 
      pool is comprised of loans that have maturity dates in 2017 (5.1%), 2020 
      (9.6%), and 2022 (85.3%). This deal is expected to experience 
      amortization of 13.4% between securitization and maturity.
    

      Two top 10 properties had exposure to Sports Authority: Newgate Mall and 
      Clifton Commons (8.1%). Both properties experienced vacancy after the 
      tenant's bankruptcy liquidation. Both properties are considered strong 
      retail centers within its submarket and the sponsors have begun 
      negotiations with replacement tenants. Although Fitch projects 
      short-term decreases in cashflow for each asset, long-term performance 
      issues are not expected due to the sponsors' experience and strong 
      historical asset operating performance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

Part I - DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION                                               

Item 1.  Distribution and Pool Performance Information.                         
        The distribution report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-D.

    During the distribution period from February 13, 2016 to March 11,
2016 no assets securitized by UBS Commercial Mortgage Securitization
      Corp. (the "Depositor") and held by UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage
     Trust 2012-C3 were the subject of a demand to repurchase or replace
   for breach of the representations and warranties contained in the
underlying transaction documents.

Part II - OTHER INFORMATION                                                     

Item 2.  Legal Proceedings.                                                     
    On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by
    Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a
derivative action against Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas
     ("DBTCA") and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company ("DBNTC") in New
York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the 
benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for 
   alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA),
   breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based
 on DBNTC and DBTCA's alleged failure to perform their duties as
  trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their
state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action 
   complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
     New York on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label RMBS
    trusts, which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in
  the state court action. The complaint alleges that the trusts at
    issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $89.4
billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money
damages in a sum certain.  DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to  
   dismiss, and on January 19, 2016, the court partially granted the
motion on procedural grounds: as to the 500 trusts that are   
  governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements, the court declined
 to exercise jurisdiction. The court did not rule on substantive
defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss as to the 64 trusts
formed under indentures for which it retained jurisdiction.   
    Instead, the court ordered plaintiffs to file an amended complaint
as to those indenture trusts. On February 23, 2016, plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint as to 62 of the 64 indenture trusts
included in the original U.S. District Court complaint.  DBNTC
and DBTCA will have an opportunity to file new defensive      
   motions with respect to this amended complaint. It is anticipated
  that plaintiffs will, in the near future, file a new state court
   complaint as to some or all of the 500 trusts governed by Pooling
and Servicing Agreements which were dismissed from the U.S.   
District Court action.                                        

On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. and IKB Deutsche
  Industriebank A.G. filed a Summons With Notice in New York state
court naming as defendants DBNTC and DBTCA, as trustees of 37 
RMBS trusts (the "IKB Action"). The claims in the IKB Action  
appear to be substantively similar to the SDNY Action. The IKB
  Action is not styled as a putative class action, but may attempt
to bring derivative claims on behalf of the named RMBS Trusts.
DBTCA intends to vigorously defend the IKB Action.            

DBTCA has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on   
DBTCA's present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the   
foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability
  to perform its duties as Trustee, Certificate Administrator, and
Custodian under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this  
transaction.                                                  

Item 6.  Significant Obligors of Pool Assets.                                   
The 1000 Harbor Boulevard Mortgage Loan is a Significant      
       Obligor within the meaning of Item 1101(k)(2) of Regulation AB and as
    disclosed in the Prospectus Supplement for UBS-Barclays Commercial
Mortgage Trust 2012-C3.                                       

 Based on the borrower's operating statement with an end date of
    December 31, 2015, Loan 30291174 (Prospectus Supplement ID 1, 1000
   Harbor Boulevard) had a year-to-date 2015 Net Operating Income of
$8,309,584.41 as of December 31, 2015.                        

Item 10. Exhibits.

Fitch Affirms UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 - MarketWatch

					Nov. 3, 2016, 3:31 p.m. EDT
				
Fitch Affirms UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4
























CHICAGO, Nov 03, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of UBS-Barclays Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2012-C4. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations are based on overall stable performance since issuance. 
      As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 5.2% to $1.381 billion from $1.456 billion 
      at issuance. Sixteen loans (14.8% of the pool) are currently on the 
      servicer watchlist; however, nine of the loans have issues related to 
      minor deferred maintenance but not considered Fitch loans of concern. 
      Seven (8.6%) of the watchlist loans, which have occupancy and/or 
      performance issues are Fitch loans of concern. Eight loans (2.9%) are 
      fully defeased.


                                        








Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the 
      pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 
      2.1% increase since last year's review and an 8.1% increase since 
      issuance for reporting loans. All loans in the pool are current as of 
      the October 2016 distribution and no loans are in special servicing.


                                        








Loan Diversity: The largest 10 loans account for 48.6% of the pool by 
      balance. It was also noted at issuance that the loan concentration index 
      (LCI) was lower than average for this transaction compared to the 2012 
      peer set.


                                        








Single Tenant Exposure: Two of the 10 largest assets, representing 13.1% 
      of the pool, are occupied by a single tenant or present exposure in 
      excess of 80% of the NRA to a single tenant, creating idiosyncratic risk 
      to property performance.


                                        








Loan Amortization: Six loans, representing nearly 19% of the collateral 
      balance, are full-term interest-only loans, above the 2012 average of 
      13%, and one loan (0.5%) has an anticipated repayment date (ARD). The 
      pool is comprised of loans that have maturity dates in 2017 (5.1%), 2020 
      (9.6%), and 2022 (85.3%). This deal is expected to experience 
      amortization of 13.4% between securitization and maturity.


                                        








Two top 10 properties had exposure to Sports Authority: Newgate Mall and 
      Clifton Commons (8.1%). Both properties experienced vacancy after the 
      tenant's bankruptcy liquidation. Both properties are considered strong 
      retail centers within its submarket and the sponsors have begun 
      negotiations with replacement tenants. Although Fitch projects 
      short-term decreases in cashflow for each asset, long-term performance 
      issues are not expected due to the sponsors' experience and strong 
      historical asset operating performance.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.


                                        








Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the 1000 Harbor Boulevard Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 0.5% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date.  The 1000 Harbor Boulevard Mortgage Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the 1000 Harbor Boulevard Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity. The other pari passu portion of the loan combination was securitized in the UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C3 transaction, Commission File Number 333-177354-03 (the “UBS-Barclays 2012-C3 Transaction”). This loan combination,
including the 1000 Harbor Boulevard Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the UBS-Barclays 2012-C3 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as the master servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the UBS-Barclays 2012-C3 Transaction, is also the primary servicer of this loan combination.  The responsibilities of Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as primary servicer of this loan combination, are subsumed within its responsibilities as master servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the UBS-Barclays 2012-C3 Transaction.
 

Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC is the special servicer of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the 1000 Harbor Boulevard Mortgage Loan. As a result, Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC is a “servicer” as defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, in the capacities described above, because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted 10% or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants’ attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index.
 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants’ attestation reports from CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC.  These entities were engaged by the master servicer of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information, and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These services are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii).  Therefore, under the principles-based definition of “servicer” set forth in Item 1101(j) that looks to the functions that an entity performs, these vendors are “servicers” for the purposes of Item 1122.  See Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)).

Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.
The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to UBS Real Estate Securities Inc., as sponsor and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, certificate administrator and custodian:
 

UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. (“UBSRES”) is currently engaged in litigation with respect to various legacy residential mortgage-backed securities transactions. Some litigants are seeking the repurchase of mortgage loans by UBSRES from certain residential mortgage securitization trusts, on the basis that the loans are allegedly in breach of contractual representations and warranties in governing transaction documents. Other litigants are alleging violations of federal and/or state securities or common law for alleged misrepresentations and omissions in offering documents in connection with the issuance and/or distribution of residential mortgage-backed securities. No assurance can be given that one or more of the foregoing actions will not result in material liability to UBSRES.
 

Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo. The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders
of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
 

Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being: BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association, No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794 trusts) and its companion case BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.
 

There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
 

Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
The information regarding this Item has been previously provided in a prospectus supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing entity filed on December 20, 2012 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5).
 

Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
The reports on assessments of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance with respect to the mortgage loans are attached hereto under Item 15 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attached as Schedule II to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K is a chart identifying the entities participating in a servicing function for the transaction responsible for each applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d).

Fitch Affirms UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 - MarketWatch


















































Bulletin






Investor Alert























press release


					Nov. 3, 2016, 3:31 p.m. EDT
				
Fitch Affirms UBS-Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C4
























CHICAGO, Nov 03, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed all classes of UBS-Barclays Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2012-C4 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2012-C4. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations are based on overall stable performance since issuance. 
      As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 5.2% to $1.381 billion from $1.456 billion 
      at issuance. Sixteen loans (14.8% of the pool) are currently on the 
      servicer watchlist; however, nine of the loans have issues related to 
      minor deferred maintenance but not considered Fitch loans of concern. 
      Seven (8.6%) of the watchlist loans, which have occupancy and/or 
      performance issues are Fitch loans of concern. Eight loans (2.9%) are 
      fully defeased.


                                        








Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the 
      pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 
      2.1% increase since last year's review and an 8.1% increase since 
      issuance for reporting loans. All loans in the pool are current as of 
      the October 2016 distribution and no loans are in special servicing.


                                        








Loan Diversity: The largest 10 loans account for 48.6% of the pool by 
      balance. It was also noted at issuance that the loan concentration index 
      (LCI) was lower than average for this transaction compared to the 2012 
      peer set.


                                        








Single Tenant Exposure: Two of the 10 largest assets, representing 13.1% 
      of the pool, are occupied by a single tenant or present exposure in 
      excess of 80% of the NRA to a single tenant, creating idiosyncratic risk 
      to property performance.


                                        








Loan Amortization: Six loans, representing nearly 19% of the collateral 
      balance, are full-term interest-only loans, above the 2012 average of 
      13%, and one loan (0.5%) has an anticipated repayment date (ARD). The 
      pool is comprised of loans that have maturity dates in 2017 (5.1%), 2020 
      (9.6%), and 2022 (85.3%). This deal is expected to experience 
      amortization of 13.4% between securitization and maturity.


                                        








Two top 10 properties had exposure to Sports Authority: Newgate Mall and 
      Clifton Commons (8.1%). Both properties experienced vacancy after the 
      tenant's bankruptcy liquidation. Both properties are considered strong 
      retail centers within its submarket and the sponsors have begun 
      negotiations with replacement tenants. Although Fitch projects 
      short-term decreases in cashflow for each asset, long-term performance 
      issues are not expected due to the sponsors' experience and strong 
      historical asset operating performance.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.


                                        








Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
