KKR Closes $13.9 Billion Americas Private Equity Fund




Largest PE Fund Dedicated to Investing in North America


Firm & Employees Demonstrate Alignment through $1.4 Billion 
      Commitment to the Fund






March 06, 2017 06:59 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing 
      of KKR Americas XII Fund (“the Fund”), a $13.9 billion fund focused on 
      opportunistic investments in private equity-related transactions 
      primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. KKR will be investing 
      nearly $1.4 billion in capital alongside investors through the Firm’s 
      balance sheet and employee commitments.
    


      “As we mark this important milestone in our Americas private equity 
      business and close our 12th flagship private equity fund, we 
      are grateful to our investors, both old and new, for their continued 
      confidence in us. In today’s increasingly complex world, we are pleased 
      that they share our enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead in 
      the Americas, in particular the U.S. where we anticipate significant 
      long-term investment opportunities and where we have been investing for 
      more than four decades and six economic cycles,” said Alexander 
      Navab, KKR Member and Head of Americas Private Equity. “Throughout 
      this period, we have invested through economic challenges and volatility 
      but have remained focused on delivering top quartile performance. That 
      continues to be our focus as we work hard to support our investors’ 
      goals and the needs of their beneficiaries.”
    

Alisa 
      Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group, 
      added: “Our optimism about the future, our team, and our belief that 
      alignment is the best demonstration of our partnership, is why KKR is 
      committing more money into this fund than any private equity fund in our 
      history.”
    

      KKR’s Americas private equity platform invests across seven industry 
      teams, including Energy; Financial Services; Healthcare; Industrials; Media 
      & Communications; Retail and Consumer; and Technology sectors. In 
      addition to traditional management buyouts and build-ups, the business 
      seeks to find opportunities to provide growth capital, as well as 
      minority investments, and public toehold investments where KKR can 
      partner with public companies, leveraging the Firm’s industry expertise 
      and operational capabilities to add value beyond just providing capital. 
      The Americas private equity team consists of over 60 experienced 
      investment professionals, and is supported by over 20 operational 
      executives in KKR Capstone.
    

      Americas XII is the largest Americas-focused private equity fund, 
      according to data sourced from Preqin. It received strong backing from a 
      diverse group of new and existing global investors, including public and 
      corporate pensions, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, 
      endowments, private banking platforms, family offices and high net worth 
      individual investors.
    

      KKR has been investing in North America since the Firm’s establishment 
      in 1976 and has been one of the most active private equity investors, 
      having completed or announced over 225 transactions with a total 
      enterprise value of approximately $495 billion. Through 11 North America 
      private equity funds, the Firm has invested approximately $48.5 billion 
      of equity in the Americas. Since inception, KKR’s first 18 private 
      equity funds have delivered over two times total capital invested on a 
      gross basis. This corresponds to a cumulative Gross IRR of 25.6% (net 
      IRR of 18.9%) and a Gross multiple of 2.1x (net multiple of 1.9x). The 
      predecessor fund of Americas XII, KKR North America Fund XI began 
      investing in late 2012 and is now fully deployed. It has generated a 
      Gross IRR of 24.0% (net IRR of 18.1%) and a Gross Multiple of 1.5x (net 
      multiple of 1.4x) as of December 31, 2016. With the closing of this 
      fund, KKR’s Americas private equity business manages approximately $36 
      billion in assets under management.

By

                    Dec 11, 2015 1:30 pm  ET
                  


Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which aims to raise at least $10 billion for its next flagship buyout fund, is dangling fee sweeteners to secure large investors and early commitments.
The New York firm will waive management fees over six months for investors who get in by the first close of KKR Americas Fund XII LP, according to a memorandum from the Oregon State Treasury, a KKR backer. The offer could encourage investors to pledge money early and boost the size of the fund’s maiden close–a crucial litmus test for how much demand the fund will draw.
KKR also proposed reduced management fees for investors that come through with bigger pledges, a move that would help the private equity titan consolidate its following among sovereign wealth funds and public pensions.

PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing of KKR Americas XII Fund (“the Fund”), a $13.9 billion fund focused on opportunistic investments in private equity-related transactions primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. KKR will be investing nearly $1.4 billion in capital alongside investors through the Firm’s balance sheet and employee commitments.
“As we mark this important milestone in our Americas private equity business and close our 12th flagship private equity fund, we are grateful to our investors, both old and new, for their continued confidence in us. In today’s increasingly complex world, we are pleased that they share our enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead in the Americas, in particular the U.S. where we anticipate significant long-term investment opportunities and where we have been investing for more than four decades and six economic cycles,” said Alexander Navab, KKR Member and Head of Americas Private Equity. “Throughout this period, we have invested through economic challenges and volatility but have remained focused on delivering top quartile performance. That continues to be our focus as we work hard to support our investors’ goals and the needs of their beneficiaries.”
Alisa Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group, added: “Our optimism about the future, our team, and our belief that alignment is the best demonstration of our partnership, is why KKR is committing more money into this fund than any private equity fund in our history.”
KKR’s Americas private equity platform invests across seven industry teams, including Energy; Financial Services; Healthcare; Industrials; Media & Communications; Retail and Consumer; and Technology sectors. In addition to traditional management buyouts and build-ups, the business seeks to find opportunities to provide growth capital, as well as minority investments, and public toehold investments where KKR can partner with public companies, leveraging the Firm’s industry expertise and operational capabilities to add value beyond just providing capital. The Americas private equity team consists of over 60 experienced investment professionals, and is supported by over 20 operational executives in KKR Capstone.
Americas XII is the largest Americas-focused private equity fund, according to data sourced from Preqin. It received strong backing from a diverse group of new and existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, private banking platforms, family offices and high net worth individual investors.
KKR has been investing in North America since the Firm’s establishment in 1976 and has been one of the most active private equity investors, having completed or announced over 225 transactions with a total enterprise value of approximately $495 billion. Through 11 North America private equity funds, the Firm has invested approximately $48.5 billion of equity in the Americas. Since inception, KKR’s first 18 private equity funds have delivered over two times total capital invested on a gross basis. This corresponds to a cumulative Gross IRR of 25.6% (net IRR of 18.9%) and a Gross multiple of 2.1x (net multiple of 1.9x). The predecessor fund of Americas XII, KKR North America Fund XI began investing in late 2012 and is now fully deployed. It has generated a Gross IRR of 24.0% (net IRR of 18.1%) and a Gross Multiple of 1.5x (net multiple of 1.4x) as of December 31, 2016. With the closing of this fund, KKR’s Americas private equity business manages approximately $36 billion in assets under management.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co said it expects KKR North America Fund XII to exceed the $8 billion raised by its predecessor, as it takes aim at a more favorable deal market.
With energy and other commodity prices reeling, and buyout opportunities emerging, the firm sees more opportunity now than in recent quarters.
“If you look at our history, for almost 40 years now, the more dislocation and the more volatility, the better we’ve done,” Henry Kravis, the firm’s co-founder, said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts. “Now we’re in even better shape because we’re global and we can invest around the world.”
Kravis said it’s tougher to invest when prices are higher, but levels have come down in a number of sectors. “It’s become more interesting for us,” he said.
On the fundraising front, KKR said it has started work to raise North America Fund XII. Since North America Fund XI has turned in top-quartile results, North America Fund XII is expected to draw in more capital, the firm said. Market sources have put the target for the newer fund at $10 billion.
KKR said it will probably activate Fund XII in 2016 or possibly 2017, since it has about $4 billion in uncalled commitments for North America Fund XI.
KKR also confirmed that it is raising its first growth equity fund to take minority stakes in more rapidly expanding companies. Its fundraising machine is also drawing commitments for its Europe IV fund, Special Situations II, KKR Asian Fund II, and KKR Real Estate Partners Europe, as well as its hedge fund strategies.
