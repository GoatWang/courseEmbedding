Company 





Overview

International Stem Cell Corporation (ISCO) is a publicly traded clinical stage biotechnology company with a powerful new stem cell technology called human parthenogenetic activation that promises to significantly advance the field of regenerative medicine.
Parthenogenetic (from the Greek parthenos meaning “virgin” and genesis meaning “birth”) activation utilizes unfertilized human eggs to create parthenogenetic stem cells (hpSC) that can be immune-matched to millions of people. As a result, a relatively small number of hpSC lines could provide enough immune-matched cells to cover a large percentage of the world’s population.
ISCO’s scientists are focused on using hpSC to treat severe diseases of the nervous system, joints and liver where cell therapy has been proven clinically effective but is limited by the availability of safe immune-matched human cells.

Manufacturing 





cGMP Manufacturing

The manufacture of ISCO’s cellular products takes place in laboratory cleanrooms within a validated manufacturing suite that was designed to meet cGMP standards for aseptic processing of a sterile product (US FDA Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing – Current Good Manufacturing Practice; European Medicines Agency, Annex 1 to EudraLex Volume 4, Good Manufacturing Practices). The company’s cleanrooms meet ISO 7 standards (Class 10,000, Grade C) for air quality under static and dynamic conditions.
All cell culture procedures, including open manipulations of culture vessels, final filling and closure of finished product, are performed inside biological safety cabinets (BSCs) that are rated ISO 5 (Class 100, Grade A) for air quality. All manipulations involve single-use, disposable plasticware, such as pipettes and culture flasks. Overall design of the cleanroom suite includes air pressure differentials between inner and outer rooms and double-door airlock entry to individual laboratory cleanrooms. Adjacent space within the cGMP suite includes gowning, clean-storage and corridor areas, each meeting the appropriate air quality standards.
Each laboratory cleanroom is a self-sufficient module, containing the range of precision scientific equipment (Type 2 BSCs, incubators, low-speed centrifuge, microscope, refrigerators, laminar flow hood) to enable cell cultivation, expansion and harvest under highly controlled and reproducible conditions.  The multi-lab, modular approach was chosen to minimize the potential for cross-contamination that can accompany larger single-laboratory cleanroom designs.




ISCO’s liquid nitrogen storage facilities provide the capacity for long-term storage and banking of cell therapy products.




Quality Systems

Regular testing of the air handling system includes particle counts, room air volume change rate, air pressure differentials and HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arresting) filter integrity, all of which consistently meet domestic and international regulatory standards for preparation of clinical-grade cell product.
Laboratory personnel receive the appropriate training in aseptic technique, gowning and line clearance. ISCO’s line clearance SOP specifies the procedures for routine disinfection within the biological safety cabinets before and after use. Decontamination of the cleanroom and equipment is performed by a qualified cGMP compliant vendor at regular intervals providing fungicidal, bactericidal and virucidal decontamination that is compatible with cleanroom equipment surfaces and HEPA filters.
ISCO performs in-house analytical characterization of cell products using flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain technology (RT-PCR).  These analytical quality-control functions are performed under SOP by appropriately trained laboratory personnel. A controlled-rate freezer is used for the customized cryopreservation of cell lines under the most optimal conditions for maintenance of cell viability.
Contract Manufacturing

ISCO offers contract development and cGMP-manufacture of cell therapy products.
With ISCO’s state-of-the-art facilities and over 25 years of combined expertise, ISCO has proficiency in cGMP manufacturing of stem cells, primary cells and tissues to meet the needs of today’s biopharmaceutical professionals. ISCO also customizes and produces uniquely formulated media designed to maintain both morphology and function of the specific cell type. ISCO is committed to producing the highest quality cell products, culture media and solutions for the life science industry.

The hpSCs are comparable to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The Company has developed a process based on parthenogenesis for the creation of a type of stem cell that has shown to exhibit the pluripotency and proliferative benefits of embryonic stem cells to avoid the use or destruction of fertilized human eggs or embryos. The Company also holds licenses to other technologies to create human pluripotent stem cells, such as Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT); a technology that maybe used to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), and single blastomere technology, which uses a single cell obtained from a fertilized blastocyst to create an embryonic stem cell line. The Company's products include therapeutic product candidates, skin care products and research products.Therapeutic Product CandidatesThe Company is engaged in developing various cell types from its stem cells that may result in therapeutic products. The clinical applications of its technology are neural stem cells for treatment of Parkinson's disease, and other central nervous system disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, stroke and Alzheimer's disease; liver cells (hepatocytes) that may be used to treat a range of congenital and acquired liver diseases, and retinal cells and three-dimensional eye structures, including corneal cells and tissue to treat degenerative retinal diseases, corneal blindness and to manage corneal healing. The Company has completed its investigational new drug (IND)-enabling preclinical studies on its program, the development of neural stem cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.Skin Care ProductsISCO's LSC subsidiary has developed skincare products containing its stem cell extract that help combat the signs of aging. LSC offers Daily Defense Complex to facilitate cell turnover and to restore skin's natural moisture levels, and to prevent ultraviolet (UV) damage. Recovery Night Moisture Serum helps manage the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin firmness and contributes to skin cell regeneration. Its Eye Firming Complex provides tightening benefits and manages puffiness, while delivering hydration to soften lines and wrinkles. Neck Firming Serum nourishes and tightens the skin in the decollate area. LSC has also developed over three skin cleansing and exfoliating products that focuses on complementing the ingredients in the night, day, eye and neck products. Its Brightening Cleanser uses various conditioning powders to help cleanse and brighten the skin. Its Dual Action Exfoliator uses glycolic acid and microcrystals to exfoliate dead skin cells. Refresh Polishing Gelee combines calming ingredients and micro beads to exfoliate the skin in preparation for application of the stem cell products. It also offers Molecular Renewal Serum, which provides a range of skin brightening and anti-aging benefits.Research ProductsISCO's LCT subsidiary develops, manufactures and commercializes over 160 human cell culture products. These products include frozen human primary cells and stem cells, and the reagents (called media) needed to grow, maintain and differentiate the cells. These techniques also produce products that do not contain non-human animal proteins. It offers these human cell-based products both domestically and internationally to research scientists in pharmaceutical, academic and government research organizations to study human disease and basic cell biology. LCT's research customers use its cell-based research products in their clinical research. LCT products and applications include human skin cells and associated reagents (DermaLife) for the study of skin disease, toxicology or wound healing; human cells from the heart and blood vessels, and associated reagents (VascuLife), used by researchers to study cardiovascular disease and cancer; human bronchial and tracheal cell lines for the study of toxicity, cystic fibrosis, asthma and pathogenesis; human mammary epithelial cell lines for the study of breast cancer, three-dimensional culture and carcinogen screening; adult stem cells (called mesenchymal stem cells) and the reagents necessary to differentiate them into various tissues, including bone, cartilage and fat; human prostate cells and specialized medium (ProstaLife) to study prostate disease including cancer; human renal and bladder cells, and associated media (RenaLife) to study renal and bladder diseases; human corneal cells and associated media (OccuLife) for the study of corneal disease, and as a model of toxicology for consumer product testing, and other cell culture reagents and supplements for the growth, staining and freezing of human cells.The Company competes with Stem Cells Inc., BioTime, Neuralstem, Inc., ReNeuron, ViaCyte, Obagi, Skinceuticals, Allergan, Murad, Lonza, EMD Millipore, Thermo Fisher Scientific, StemCell Technologies, Zen-bio, PromoCell and Specialty Media.

That's why they'll like Lifeline's new eye cream -- women want something that really works."Eye creams are considered a "must-have" in anti-aging skincare, and are typically the most popular product with customers. The new Eye Firming Complex includes novel ingredients designed to produce beneficial results, including peptides and HSC-X™ -- the human stem cell extract developed and patented by International Stem Cell Corporation which is used in the Company's anti-aging Day and Night serums."This addition to our skincare line has been highly anticipated," says Donna Queen, President of Lifeline Skin Care. "An eye treatment was the #1 request by our customers."About International Stem Cell CorporationInternational Stem Cell Corporation is focused on the therapeutic applications of human parthenogenetic stem cells (hpSCs) and the development and commercialization of cell-based research and cosmetic products. ISCO's core technology, parthenogenesis, results in the creation of pluripotent human stem cells from unfertilized oocytes (eggs) hence avoiding ethical issues associated with the use or destruction of viable human embryos. ISCO scientists have created the first parthenogenetic, homozygous stem cell line that can be a source of therapeutic cells for hundreds of millions of individuals of differing genders, ages and racial background with minimal immune rejection after transplantation. hpSCs offer the potential to create the first true stem cell bank, UniStemCell™. ISCO also produces and markets specialized cells and growth media for therapeutic research worldwide through its subsidiary Lifeline Cell Technology (www.lifelinecelltech.com), and stem cell-based skin care products through its subsidiary Lifeline Skin Care (www.lifelineskincare.com).

Adult Stem Cell Therapy








“Your stem cells. Your quality of life.”
Moving Forward
As we look to our future, we find technology and scientific breakthroughs moving us forward in ways we never expected. This ongoing discovery has given rise to a new alternative method of treatment, a new way of managing our lives. Stem cell therapy has become one of the most exciting and promising fields in biological science today. Advancements in stem cell therapy give us the ability to manage our wellness so we can live fuller and healthier lives with our loved ones.
Autologous Adipose Stem Cell Transplantation
Stemedix™ Adipose Adult Stem Cell Transplantation procedure is used to help repair some of the world’s most common medical diseases. There are five steps to this treatment process in harvesting adipose tissue (fat) from your body.
Step 1: Preparation
Using local anesthetics, our board certified physicians prep the lower abdomen for manual mini liposuction procedure. The amount of adipose tissue to be extracted depends on which ailment is being treated; in most cases between 40-200cc is needed.
Step 2: Collection
Once the adipose tissue is collected, a centrifuge process is used to separate the gathered cells into a top layer of fat and a potent concentration containing millions of stem cells at the bottom.
Step 3: Enrichment
Blood is then taken from the patient and spun in a special centrifuge to separate the blood into its multiple parts. The blood platelets (PRP) that contain growth factors are added to the stem cell concentration. This enrichment process prepares the platelet rich plasma and stem cells to be activated.
Step 4: Cell Activation
A Stemedix™ physician uses a patented laser activation process to stimulate the enriched stem cells before they are reintroduced via intravenous, intravascular, and/or direct injection into specific locations within the body.
Step 5: Transplantation
The final step is to introduce the activated stem cells back into the body. Unlike traditional treatments offering less than optimal options, this revolutionary procedure gathers stem cells from their most abundant source and activates them to ensure their survival. Adipose tissue (fat) has the highest concentration of stem cells and can produce billions of cells with the potential to repair, replenish, and begin rejuvenating your body immediately.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Stem Cell Bank 





UnistemCell Bank

UniStemCell bank is the life science industry’s first collection of non-embryonic histocompatible human stem cells available for research and commercial use. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system represents antigens important for transplantation. Normally donor tissue is screened for antigens in order to determine the degree of histocompatibility (or tissue compatibility) with the recipient. HLA haplotypes are classed as HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DR locus alleles and there are roughly 200 common HLA haplotypes in the US Caucasian population. Tissue derived from stem cells faces the same problem of tissue rejection as organ transplantation. One way to produce HLA matched cells for cell-based therapy is by using human histocompatible stem cells with homozygous HLA loci.




Matching donor and recipient tissue for HLA greatly increases the likelihood of transplant survival.









International Stem Cell Corporation has developed a proprietary technique for creating histocompatible stem cells via parthenogenetic activation (human parthenogenetic stem cells or hpSC). The process uses unfertilized human eggs and results in the cells inheriting a duplicate set of HLA genes. Matching donor and recipient tissue for HLA greatly increases the likelihood of transplant survival. This significantly reduces the possibility of the derived cells being rejected by an individual’s immune system making a single cell line suitable for treating millions of individuals. A relatively small number of such cell lines could be sufficient to provide “immune matched” cells to a large percentage of the world’s population.




Use of hpSC

Why use hpSC? This type of cell retains all of the advantages required to generate targeted histocompatible therapeutic tissues while being unable to generate a complete human organism. 
They are as pluripotent and proliferative as a human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), but do not carry any possible genetic damage caused by reprogramming in the case of iPSC.
Because hpSC are not derived from the patient, they will not carry a genetic disease that is inherent in the patient. For example, if cells are taken from a person with cystic fibrosis to generate stem cells, then those cells carry the same disease, making them less useful. An independent source of cells is a superior choice in this case.

Osteoarthritis








What is Osteoarthritis?
The chronic disease Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage. As the cartilage in joints of the body deteriorate, bones begin to rub against one another. This can cause pain and stiffness that make joint movement difficult. OA can also result in damage to ligaments, menisci and muscles. There are two types of OA – primary and secondary. Primary osteoarthritis is generally associated with the aging process and is simply the “wears and tears” one endures throughout life. As you become older, the more likely you are to have some degree of primary osteoarthritis; however, this does not mean OA has to be a normal aspect of aging. Secondary osteoarthritis tends to develop relatively early in life, typically 10 or more years after a specific cause, such as an injury.
Osteoarthritis most often occurs in knees, hips, and hands. Other joints, like the shoulders, can also be affected. OA rarely affects other joints but can as a result of injury or struggles with obesity. The pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis can make it difficult to do daily activities and exercises. In the early stages of OA, damage begins to affect the cartilage that covers the joint surfaces of the body and is limited to a small area. OA is considered a progressive disease where over time, bone density surrounding the joint increases solidifying a diagnosis. In the late stages of OA, the joint cartilage in the affected area is not only diseased and damaged, but completely worn away. Without that protective plush covering, adjoining bones rub directly against each other causing severe pain, swelling, and stiffness.
Osteoarthritis treatments today focus mainly to relieve symptoms. There is currently no cure for OA but many treatments and therapies are available to maintain joint movement, control pain, and relieve stiffness. Medications such as acetaminophen,  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and narcotics are commonly used to relieve a variety of symptoms. Topical pain relievers are also often prescribed to fight discomfort of diseased joints. Surgery, including joint replacement, may be a considered option for severely damaged joints. Assistive devices, physical therapy, occupational therapy, weight loss, nutritional supplements, and meditation are other approaches offered to help manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis.
Adult Stem Cell Therapy for Osteoarthritis
Adipose stem cell therapy is a new alternative treatment to help manage the symptoms of osteoarthritis. The stem cells harvested from a patient have the potential to replace countless cells of the body including those damaged by OA. Recent research in the advancement of adult stem cell therapy has shown that restoration of these damaged cells through this treatment is possible. Results of several early clinical studies of stem cell transplantation for OA have shown promising results. This breakthrough in regenerative medicine shines a light of hope on those battling this degenerative disease. Improvements have been seen in the following symptoms after treatment:

Increased energy
Reduction or elimination of joint pain
Reduction or elimination of joint tenderness
Reduction or elimination of joint stiffness
Increased joint flexibility
Reduction or elimination of joint swelling
Reduction in the occurrence of grating sensations

Our board-certified physicians are confident in knowing the potential of this treatment to improve one’s quality of life battling OA. While there is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, our methods can assist in gaining beneficial results that have shown to improve the life and health of those looking to manage their condition and varied symptoms. By using adipose stem cell therapy, an alternative is available for those who have not responded to typical drug treatment or traditional procedures showing less than optimal results. With Stemedix™ adult stem cell therapy, your journey to the rebuilding process can begin.

Adult Stem Cell Therapy








“Your stem cells. Your quality of life.”
Moving Forward
As we look to our future, we find technology and scientific breakthroughs moving us forward in ways we never expected. This ongoing discovery has given rise to a new alternative method of treatment, a new way of managing our lives. Stem cell therapy has become one of the most exciting and promising fields in biological science today. Advancements in stem cell therapy give us the ability to manage our wellness so we can live fuller and healthier lives with our loved ones.
Autologous Adipose Stem Cell Transplantation
Stemedix™ Adipose Adult Stem Cell Transplantation procedure is used to help repair some of the world’s most common medical diseases. There are five steps to this treatment process in harvesting adipose tissue (fat) from your body.
Step 1: Preparation
Using local anesthetics, our board certified physicians prep the lower abdomen for manual mini liposuction procedure. The amount of adipose tissue to be extracted depends on which ailment is being treated; in most cases between 40-200cc is needed.
Step 2: Collection
Once the adipose tissue is collected, a centrifuge process is used to separate the gathered cells into a top layer of fat and a potent concentration containing millions of stem cells at the bottom.
Step 3: Enrichment
Blood is then taken from the patient and spun in a special centrifuge to separate the blood into its multiple parts. The blood platelets (PRP) that contain growth factors are added to the stem cell concentration. This enrichment process prepares the platelet rich plasma and stem cells to be activated.
Step 4: Cell Activation
A Stemedix™ physician uses a patented laser activation process to stimulate the enriched stem cells before they are reintroduced via intravenous, intravascular, and/or direct injection into specific locations within the body.
Step 5: Transplantation
The final step is to introduce the activated stem cells back into the body. Unlike traditional treatments offering less than optimal options, this revolutionary procedure gathers stem cells from their most abundant source and activates them to ensure their survival. Adipose tissue (fat) has the highest concentration of stem cells and can produce billions of cells with the potential to repair, replenish, and begin rejuvenating your body immediately.

Multiple Sclerosis








What is Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease in which the central nervous system (CNS) is attacked by one’s own immune system. Neurons in the brain are lined with a fatty, protective tissue called the myelin sheath that surrounds each nerve fiber. These protective tissues are attacked by an abnormal immune response causing inflammation and exposure of nerve fibers. This exposure causes a disoriented signal flow between nerve cells and the brain resulting in loss of motor skills, coordination and cognitive abilities.
Multiple Sclerosis can be a challenging disease to treat since the progression and severity of symptoms affect each patient uniquely. Some symptoms of MS can include abnormal sensations in extremities, decreased tactility in hands, fatigue, loss of balance, and muscle aches. Individuals with more severe symptoms may experience bladder problems, difficulty walking, dizziness, muscle spasms and loss of vision. The array of symptoms associated with MS generally appears in episodic periods of worsening, also referred to as flare-ups, and can cause progressive deterioration of neurological functions. An example of this neurological damage can be seen in what patients consider as brain fog, moments of confusion or an inability to concentrate on specified tasks.
How is MS Treated Today?
MS research has resulted in two treatment methods; the first method is preventing the abnormal response of one’s immune system. The second method is replenishing the myelin sheath cells protecting the nerve fibers. Medications designed today follow the first method in delaying the abnormal immune response. Traditionally, there was a lack of treatment options for the second method. However, with new research and breakthrough technology, physicians of regenerative medicine have produced a treatment to replace the cells damaged by this disease. Autologous stem cell therapy is a regenerative treatment designed to use the patient’s own adult stem cells to repair and replace diseased tissue in the body. Past treatments have shown that adult stem cells not only have the potential to regenerate lost or damaged myelin sheath tissues, but also have the ability to modulate the immune system, temporarily disabling the abnormal attack.

Stem Cell Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis
Autologous adipose stem cell transplantation is a process of harvesting stem cells from their most abundant source, adipose (fat) tissue, activating them through an enrichment process, and re-introducing them into one’s own body. Stem cells by nature target areas of the body following inflammatory signals (where treatment is most needed) and begin the necessary repair. This advancement in using adult stem cell therapy assists the body to regenerate missing or diseased tissue that would not ordinarily be regrown.
Adult adipose stem cell therapy provides an advanced treatment that helps fight against the degenerative disease. Relief using Stemedix™ stem cell therapy can be achieved in a variety of symptoms associated with this condition:

Reduction or elimination of muscle pains and spasms
Reduction or elimination of numbness and tingling sensations
Improved concentration
Improved coordination
Increased energy
Slight improvements in vision loss
Improved balance and movement
Reduction or elimination of headaches
Improved tactility (sense of touch)
Improved bladder function

While there is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis, our physicians use adult stem cell therapy to provide an alternative for those who don’t respond to typical drug treatment or when traditional procedures have shown less than optimal outcomes. Autologous stem cell therapy can assist in the reversal of challenging symptoms and damage associated with MS. Whether you have recently been diagnosed or battling this disease for years, know that MS does not have to control your life. With Stemedix™ adult stem cell therapy, your rebuilding process can begin.

Multiple Sclerosis








What is Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease in which the central nervous system (CNS) is attacked by one’s own immune system. Neurons in the brain are lined with a fatty, protective tissue called the myelin sheath that surrounds each nerve fiber. These protective tissues are attacked by an abnormal immune response causing inflammation and exposure of nerve fibers. This exposure causes a disoriented signal flow between nerve cells and the brain resulting in loss of motor skills, coordination and cognitive abilities.
Multiple Sclerosis can be a challenging disease to treat since the progression and severity of symptoms affect each patient uniquely. Some symptoms of MS can include abnormal sensations in extremities, decreased tactility in hands, fatigue, loss of balance, and muscle aches. Individuals with more severe symptoms may experience bladder problems, difficulty walking, dizziness, muscle spasms and loss of vision. The array of symptoms associated with MS generally appears in episodic periods of worsening, also referred to as flare-ups, and can cause progressive deterioration of neurological functions. An example of this neurological damage can be seen in what patients consider as brain fog, moments of confusion or an inability to concentrate on specified tasks.
How is MS Treated Today?
MS research has resulted in two treatment methods; the first method is preventing the abnormal response of one’s immune system. The second method is replenishing the myelin sheath cells protecting the nerve fibers. Medications designed today follow the first method in delaying the abnormal immune response. Traditionally, there was a lack of treatment options for the second method. However, with new research and breakthrough technology, physicians of regenerative medicine have produced a treatment to replace the cells damaged by this disease. Autologous stem cell therapy is a regenerative treatment designed to use the patient’s own adult stem cells to repair and replace diseased tissue in the body. Past treatments have shown that adult stem cells not only have the potential to regenerate lost or damaged myelin sheath tissues, but also have the ability to modulate the immune system, temporarily disabling the abnormal attack.

Stem Cell Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis
Autologous adipose stem cell transplantation is a process of harvesting stem cells from their most abundant source, adipose (fat) tissue, activating them through an enrichment process, and re-introducing them into one’s own body. Stem cells by nature target areas of the body following inflammatory signals (where treatment is most needed) and begin the necessary repair. This advancement in using adult stem cell therapy assists the body to regenerate missing or diseased tissue that would not ordinarily be regrown.
Adult adipose stem cell therapy provides an advanced treatment that helps fight against the degenerative disease. Relief using Stemedix™ stem cell therapy can be achieved in a variety of symptoms associated with this condition:

Reduction or elimination of muscle pains and spasms
Reduction or elimination of numbness and tingling sensations
Improved concentration
Improved coordination
Increased energy
Slight improvements in vision loss
Improved balance and movement
Reduction or elimination of headaches
Improved tactility (sense of touch)
Improved bladder function

While there is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis, our physicians use adult stem cell therapy to provide an alternative for those who don’t respond to typical drug treatment or when traditional procedures have shown less than optimal outcomes. Autologous stem cell therapy can assist in the reversal of challenging symptoms and damage associated with MS. Whether you have recently been diagnosed or battling this disease for years, know that MS does not have to control your life. With Stemedix™ adult stem cell therapy, your rebuilding process can begin.

(Lifeline) will launch its next generation skin care product based on a breakthrough nano-compound technology in time for December holiday season.The initial launch of the Molecular Renewal SerumTM is expected in mid-December of 2015, when a retail version of the product will be available for purchase by US-based consumers through Lifeline's website. Subsequent product launches will target the domestic professional sales market, which includes luxury spas, aestheticians, and medical offices, as well as luxury skincare markets in Europe and Asia.The technology behind Molecular Renewal SerumTM was developed by ISCO's R&D Team and the serum was formulated by a well-known cosmetic chemist. Independent third party testing demonstrated that the new skin care product containing the novel nano-compound showed significant (p<0.01) improvement in skin elasticity and decrease in skin roughness in all subjects 4 and 8 weeks after the start of the study. In addition, the compound-treated group outperformed not only the baseline, but also the Retinol treated group. No adverse events, such as skin irritation, which has been reported as a common side effect of Retinol treatment, were reported in the compound-treated group. In addition to the clinical study, the nano-compound was tested on normal human keratinocytes, fibroblasts and a 3D model of human skin. In all of these models the proprietary compound induced up to twice the production of elastin and collagen compared to Retinoic Acid (the active form of Retinol) with none of its toxic characteristics. This technology is the next step forward from the current product family, which has earned recognition from many industry professionals as well as retail customers.Dr. Steven F. Weiner, M.D. Facial Plastic Surgeon, a pioneer in the field of minimally invasive cosmetic procedures, commented: "Our office has been using Lifeline Stem Cell Skin products for about 4 years. We have used it on freshly lasered and microneedled skin without complications and with improved healing times. All of our Infini patients have Lifeline applied and most continue to use it well after treatment because of the noted skin improvements it provides. It's our best-selling growth factor product because of its higher concentrations of growth factors, streamlined product line and superior results."Since its inception in 2010 in California, Lifeline has experienced steady growth in sales and is currently generating operating income. With $2,6M in YTD revenue, Lifeline continues to follow its upward growth trend. Lifeline's Q3 revenues equaled $924K, with Q4 revenues expected to surpass Q3.Lifeline employs a highly experienced team of employees, along with top industry consulting talent in order to develop cutting edge line-up of products based on proprietary extract derived from ISCO's pluripotent stem cells. The extract is manufactured by ISCO R&D team in cGMP compliant facilities and undergoes rigorous QC and independent clinical testing. Current product line includes the Daily Defensive Complex, Recovery Night Moisture Serum, Eye Firming Complex, Dual Action Exfoliator, and Brightening Cleanser. In addition to the Molecular Renewal Serum, in 2015 Lifeline introduced two new products -- Refresh Polishing Gelée and Neck Firming Complex. In 2016 Lifeline plans to introduce several new products based on its proprietary extract and nano-compound technologies.Jill Haynes, a Medical Aesthetician working under Jonathan Sykes, MD at University of California, Davis Medical Center recommends micro-needling treatments along with Lifeline Skincare products to her patients. "I am seeing incredible results in my patients. This is the biggest skin care breakthrough in years." Jill applies Lifeline Skin Care stem cell serums during and after her treatments, and sends her patients home with the same products. "It's not just about one product or procedure; it's about using the best products and procedures in conjunction to create noticeable change in the skin."Read MoreJonathan Sykes, M.D., is a world renowned pioneer in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery research. His research has shaped the direction of the field and guided improvement of facial plastic and reconstructive surgical techniques and outcomes. To date, he has published over 100 articles in scientific and medical journals, in addition to contributing to numerous medical school textbooks.Lifeline's products are distributed domestically through its branded website (www.lifelineskincare.com) and through a network of dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and spas, including the Woodhouse Spa, Four Seasons Resort in Maui, and the TriBeCa MedSpa in New York City. Internationally Lifeline products are distributed through a network of local distributors. Shuei Trading Company, Lifeline's largest international distributor, has introduced currently offered and custom developed Lifeline products to the Japanese and Hong Kong markets.About International Stem Cell CorporationInternational Stem Cell Corporation (ISCO) is focused on the therapeutic applications of human parthenogenetic stem cells (hpSCs) and the development and commercialization of cell-based research and cosmetic products. ISCO's core technology, parthenogenesis, results in the creation of pluripotent human stem cells from unfertilized oocytes (eggs). hpSCs avoid ethical issues associated with the use or destruction of viable human embryos. ISCO scientists have created the first parthenogenetic, homozygous stem cell line that can be a source of therapeutic cells for hundreds of millions of individuals of differing genders, ages and racial background with minimal immune rejection after transplantation. hpSCs offer the potential to create the first true stem cell bank, UniStemCell™. ISCO also produces and markets specialized cells and growth media for therapeutic research worldwide through its subsidiary Lifeline Cell Technology (www.lifelinecelltech.com), and stem cell-based skin care products through its subsidiary Lifeline Skin Care (www.lifelineskincare.com).

Clinical Trials on Stem-Kine
1. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells: a new approach to anti-aging medicine?
Journal of Translational Medicine 2009, 7:106. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KWH, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel A, Murphy MP, Smith L, Alexandrescu DT, Ichim TE, Riordan NH. ABSTRACT: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality, as well as numerous age-related conditions. The possibility of preserving or even rejuvenating endothelial function offers a potent means of preventing/treating some of the most fearful aspects of aging such as loss of mental, cardiovascular, and sexual function. Endothelial precursor cells (EPC) provide a continual source of replenishment for damaged or senescent blood vessels. In this review we discuss the biological relevance of circulating EPC in a variety of pathologies in order to build the case that these cells act as an endogenous mechanism of regeneration. Factors controlling EPC mobilization, migration, and function, as well as therapeutic interventions based on mobilization of EPC will be reviewed. We conclude by discussing several clinically-relevant approaches to EPC mobilization and provide preliminary data on a food supplement, Stem-Kine, which enhanced EPC mobilization in human subjects…

2. Nutraceutical augmentation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells in human subjects
Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, Apr 8;8:34. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KW, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel AN, Murphy MP, Smith L, Ramos F, Ichim TE, Riordan NH. ABSTRACT: The medical significance of circulating endothelial or hematopoietic progenitors is becoming increasing recognized. While therapeutic augmentation of circulating progenitor cells using G-CSF has resulted in promising preclinical and early clinical data for several degenerative conditions, this approach is limited by cost and inability to perform chronic administration. Stem-Kine is a food supplement that was previously reported to augment circulating EPC in a pilot study. Here we report a trial in 18 healthy volunteers administered Stem-Kine twice daily for a 2 week period. Significant increases in circulating CD133 and CD34 cells were observed at days 1, 2, 7, and 14 subsequent to initiation of administration, which correlated with increased hematopoietic progenitors as detected by the HALO assay…

Clinical Trials on Stem-Kine
1. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells: a new approach to anti-aging medicine?
Journal of Translational Medicine 2009, 7:106. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KWH, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel A, Murphy MP, Smith L, Alexandrescu DT, Ichim TE, Riordan NH.
ABSTRACT: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality, as well as numerous age-related conditions. The possibility of preserving or even rejuvenating endothelial function offers a potent means of preventing/treating some of the most fearful aspects of aging such as loss of mental, cardiovascular, and sexual function. Endothelial precursor cells (EPC) provide a continual source of replenishment for damaged or senescent blood vessels. In this review we discuss the biological relevance of circulating EPC in a variety of pathologies in order to build the case that these cells act as an endogenous mechanism of regeneration. Factors controlling EPC mobilization, migration, and function, as well as therapeutic interventions based on mobilization of EPC will be reviewed. We conclude by discussing several clinically-relevant approaches to EPC mobilization and provide preliminary data on a food supplement, Stem-Kine, which enhanced EPC mobilization in human subjects…

2. Nutraceutical augmentation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells in human subjects
Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, Apr 8;8:34. Mikirova NA, Jackson JA, Hunninghake R, Kenyon J, Chan KW, Swindlehurst CA, Minev B, Patel AN, Murphy MP, Smith L, Ramos F, Ichim TE, Riordan NH.
ABSTRACT: The medical significance of circulating endothelial or hematopoietic progenitors is becoming increasing recognized. While therapeutic augmentation of circulating progenitor cells using G-CSF has resulted in promising preclinical and early clinical data for several degenerative conditions, this approach is limited by cost and inability to perform chronic administration. Stem-Kine is a food supplement that was previously reported to augment circulating EPC in a pilot study. Here we report a trial in 18 healthy volunteers administered Stem-Kine twice daily for a 2 week period. Significant increases in circulating CD133 and CD34 cells were observed at days 1, 2, 7, and 14 subsequent to initiation of administration, which correlated with increased hematopoietic progenitors as detected by the HALO assay…

How Does it Work?
Stem-Kine’s powerful ingredients contain a proprietary, heat-treated extract of Lactobacillus Fermentum and the powerful antioxidants astragalus root, goji berry, and green tea. This cell wall extract gives Stem-Kine its “fertilizer effect” and releases stem cells into the bloodstream & protects those cells from oxidative stress. Supplemental ingredients include beta-1,3-glucan, vitamin D3, and ellagic acid to further protect stem cells from oxidative stress.*†
  Lactobacillus Fermentum
Containing patented and patent-pending fermented blends of astragalus root, goji berry, and green tea, our proprietary ingredient nourishes the bone marrow to release more stem cells into the blood stream. Once these stem cells are in circulation, they can hone to sources of injury within the body and begin the repair process.*†
  Beta 1,3 Glucan
A natural immune booster, beta glucans have been shown in multiple research studies to trigger a cascade of events that help regulate the immune system, making it stronger and more efficient. Beta glucans are also extremely important for heart health. A recent research study showed that people who ingested more beta glucans, had a significantly greater reduction of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL).*†
  Ellagic Acid
Sourced from nature’s powerful antioxidant, pomegranate, ellagic acid harbors a powerful chemoprotective effect by reducing oxidative stress. This ingredient helps to protect your stem cells from free radicals.*†
  Vitamin D3
For more than a century, scientists have recognized that Vitamin D3 is involved in bone health. Not only that, it is paramount in immune support & low levels of Vitamin D3 are linked to depression, back pain, cancer, impaired immunity, and much more.*†

Proven in Human Studies
Other supplements have studies on fruit flies or in petri dishes. We have demonstrated Stem-Kine’s potency in human clinical trials, the only way to truly demonstrate whether or not a supplement actually works!

Clinical Trial #1


Clinical Trial #2




Supplementation with Stem-Kine has been shown to result in a double the amount increase in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)!1*
*Results not necessarily typical.  Individual results may vary.



Stem-Kine increased the amount of CD-133 hematopoietic stem cells significantly over control levels!2*











How to take?

  Take 2-4 capsules per day as part of a healthy diet.  Can be taken with or without food.
  Loading dose = 2 servings AM/PM (4 capsules daily)
  Maintenance dose = 1 servings AM (2 capsules daily)

Overview:
We suggest taking a double dose for the first bottle (4 capsules daily) to optimize the release of stem cells over the first 2-week period of time.  Continuing with a maintenance dose of 2 capsules/day will help to nourish these stem cells and protect them from oxidative stress.  Responses to Stem-Kine may differ, and some individuals may want to continue taking 4 capsules daily to maintain optimal effects.  As with any new supplement, it is advised to consult your physician before using. If you are using any prescription or over-the-counter medicines, are unaware of your current medical condition, or have any pre-existing medical condition(s), consult with your physician before using this product. There are no known side effects from taking Stem-Kine.
