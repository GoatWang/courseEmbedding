MP Global Products was founded as Midwest Padding LLC in 1997. For more than 15 years, we have taken what is discarded and may be deemed as trash to some and have embraced those raw unwanted materials as our way of business.  We are problem solvers, innovators, and an eco-aware company with environmentally friendly, high-performing fiber acoustic floor underlayment products for laminate, flooring underlayments for tile, and flooring underlayments for hardwood.  We were "Green" before it was even fashionable.  Our QuietWalk® brand rapidly became a leading laminate floor underlayment for the entire floating floor underlayment industry. At first, our  competitors scoffed at our "ugly" underlayment, but today they are scrambling to invent their own green flooring underlayment story.
 
Our flooring underlayment options are specifically geared to address moisture protection, sound deadening, and sustainability.   Many of our floor underlayment products meet the most rigorous independently certified indoor air quality standards.
Today, more than ever, architects and designers specify and recommend our flooring underlayment products for home construction, commercial,  high-rise apartment complex or condominium.

Datto Launches New Global Partner Program to Accelerate Growth for Managed Service Providers



Share Article

















Datto’s dedication to MSP partners reflected in unique program benefits







We appreciate that Datto invests so heavily in its partners' success.


Norwalk, CT (PRWEB)
March 09, 2017
 Datto, the leading provider of total data protection solutions for businesses around the world, today announced the launch of its new Global Partner Program. As a channel only organization, the MSP community is always the top priority for Datto. With more than 6,000 partners across the globe, Datto listened and acted on essential feedback from the MSP ecosystem to create the new program. The Datto Global Partner Program was developed to accelerate partners’ business growth with actionable enablement programs focused on sales and marketing. Datto’s overarching goal of the program is to further invest in the MSP community with more training, education and resources to empower partners with the tools they need to be successful.   
Building on the prior award-winning Datto partner program, the new program includes business planning, commercial and technical education sessions, enhanced training and onboarding best practices, as well as access to Datto’s business continuity, disaster recovery and managed networking solutions. The program structure benchmarks partners by monthly recurring revenue in four new tiers: Business, Professional, Enterprise, and Blue.
Some of the program highlights include:
MarketNow: A marketing automation platform designed for non-marketers, with pre-built promotional campaigns, co-branded and customizable collateral, and streamlined social media content to communicate with clients and prospects at the right time with the right message to grow their business.
Benchmark Analysis: Partners will have the opportunity to evaluate their businesses against new research and benchmarks from top Datto Partner performers, identifying opportunities for growth and training with their Datto Account Managers. 
Not for Resale (NFR) Program: Datto’s NFR Program supports and empowers partners to perform live demonstrations for customers with discounted device programs for internal use or demos. Partners are now able to receive one NFR device per product family to experience it all.
Advanced Sales Tactics Training: This new course focuses on the benefits and opportunities of going up market and unique sales strategies for mid-market organizations.
