About Us












	Investment Counselor


	BTR is an investment counseling firm that serves high-net-worth individuals and families, foundations, and retirement plans. We devote the bulk of the firm’s resources to investment research and portfolio management and construct for each of our clients a tailored investment solution based on the client’s unique risk parameters, tax status, and financial objectives. Portfolios consist primarily of individual equities and fixed-income securities.


	Disciplined portfolio construction and ongoing management are the critical foundations for investment success. BTR directly manages each portfolio because this allows customization and greater portfolio transparency. In-house portfolio management also means we can assist clients in navigating turbulent markets by communicating the rationale behind our investment stance.


	BTR portfolio managers serve broadly as trusted advisors, helping our clients develop plans for retirement and navigate key financial decisions. We welcome the opportunity to help clients solve complex financial questions in conjunction with their tax and legal advisors.


	Independent, Experienced, and Engaged 


Our firm was founded in 1989 as an independent, employee-owned, and SEC-registered investment advisor. Our business model allows us to put our clients first and avoid the conflicts of interest inherent in brokerage and certain other financial advisory arrangements. The founders believed that this was the best model for serving our clients. Over more than two decades we have built the firm into an institution capable of serving our clients’ needs for generations to come. Each BTR client is served by a dedicated portfolio manager, who becomes a core member of the client's financial team. We are discerning in seeking experienced and responsive portfolio managers with training from top-tier institutions and substantive professional credentials.


FAQ


+
Q: With whom do I work at BTR? How (and how often) will I interact with the firm?A:
	Each BTR client will work with two of our senior investment professionals, one of whom will serve as the portfolio manager and primary point of contact. This arrangement ensures a high level of availability and responsiveness to client needs. We understand that our clients use multiple channels of communication for convenience. While we value face-to-face engagement, we are comfortable working with clients over the phone, on a web meeting, or via e-mail. We are available as needed, but aim to conduct a detailed portfolio review with each client at least once a year.




+
Q: What types of clients does BTR serve?A:
	BTR serves individuals, families, trusts, estates, conservatorships, foundations, and pension and profit-sharing plans.




+
Q: What will my portfolio contain?A:
	BTR portfolios primarily consist of individual equities and fixed-income instruments, but may also hold a small number of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, where appropriate, to achieve specific industry and/or geographic exposure.




+
Q: How is BTR compensated?A:
	BTR earns a fee based on the amount of assets under management.  We do not charge markups on transactions nor do we hold inventory of securities for sale to our clients. Furthermore, BTR does not charge set-up or termination fees.




+
Q: What are your fees?A:
	BTR charges each client a fee of 1.00% per annum on the first $3 million of that client’s assets we manage and 0.75% on the next $7 million in assets, with an annual minimum fee of $10,000. Fees on assets exceeding $10 million are negotiable. For fixed income-only portfolios, BTR charges a fee of 0.50% per annum with the same annual minimum fee of $10,000. Related accounts may be combined for fee calculation purposes.




+
Q: What are the firm’s minimums?A:
	BTR serves clients with $1 million or more in assets to be placed under our management. Related accounts may be combined to meet this minimum. 




+
Q: Who owns the firm?A:
	BTR is wholly owned and managed by the firm’s principals. The firm’s founders have implemented a transition and succession plan that has enabled BTR to attract and retain the next generation of portfolio managers and senior administrators as co-owners of the firm. 




+
Q: Will BTR manage an account comprised only of equities or fixed income?A:
	Yes, in addition to balanced portfolios, BTR manages portfolios comprised solely of equities or fixed income.




+
Q: Where are my assets held?A:
	All BTR client assets are held at an independent, third-party “qualified custodian” for safekeeping. A qualified custodian is generally a broker-dealer or a bank trust department.




+
Q: Am I able to select specific custodians or brokers?A:
	Yes, BTR maintains relationships with several custodians and many brokers. You may choose a custodian for your assets to execute securities transactions for your account. Please contact us with questions about specific custodians or brokers.




+
Q: Will you accommodate existing holdings or must I sell them?A:
	BTR will tailor around and accommodate existing holdings or investment restrictions in implementing your portfolio. With each new client, we establish guidelines and objectives for portfolio management, including the treatment of existing holdings. Existing positions are then managed according to each client’s instructions and may be sold down over time or held indefinitely. 




+
Q: Do I approve each trade in advance?A:
	BTR is an SEC-registered investment advisor with discretionary authority over client accounts. BTR will execute individual trades according to client guidelines and objectives. Clients do not provide authorization for each trade. However, BTR must always act in the client’s best interest when providing investment advice and portfolio management.

The stock market is off to a rough start this year, with the S&P 500 stock index down about 10% in January as of mid-day today.  Many commentators have taken to the air with predictions of doom and gloom, and comparisons are being made to the last big “bear market” of 2008.  While market volatility […]

2016 – The Year Ahead

Published: December 29, 2015


Stock market advances never proceed in a straight line, and in 2015 U.S. stocks paused for breath.  While the U.S. economy continued to grow this past year, it did so at a slower rate than we had expected, due in large part to the drag on the economy from the energy and manufacturing sectors.  The […]

Why BTR









	Rigor – Insight – Diligence


	BTR portfolio managers rigorously research investments on behalf of our clients. Our goal is to identify themes and sources of value in advance of their recognition by the broader market. We devote the bulk of the firm’s research efforts and expertise to developing these insights. By hiring BTR as a discretionary manager, our clients hold us accountable for bringing our best ideas to bear in managing their portfolios. BTR also brings the same level of diligence to each client relationship, in an attempt to ensure that each investment portfolio is customized to a client’s objectives and the potential for risk and return are properly aligned.


	Conservative – Consistent – Thematic 


	Since the firm’s founding, we have consistently followed what we believe is a conservative and time-tested approach to investing. Our conservative approach means we work diligently to avoid unjustified aggressiveness and outsized losses, even though investing in any financial instrument inherently involves a risk of loss. Our priorities are to preserve the investment assets that our clients have accumulated and grow them to meet future objectives. We seek to identify investment themes that we believe will generate above-average returns and pay close attention to the prices we pay for securities relative to measures of long-term or intrinsic value. This approach has resulted in a track record of strong performance.


	Service – Integrity – Partnership


	Responsiveness and transparency are the two most important elements of a financial advisory relationship. BTR places a high emphasis on the quality of communication with our clients; we seek open, honest, and transparent interaction. We embrace our role as trusted advisor, problem solver, and leader on a client’s financial team, and partner closely with their accountants and attorneys. BTR portfolio managers work with our clients to reduce the complexity associated with ongoing financial management.

Our Approach









	A Time-Tested Approach to Investment Management


	BTR is an investment counseling firm. Each client works with the portfolio managers who are directly responsible for management and oversight of that client’s investments. At the outset of our relationship, we work with clients to identify a unique balance point between potential risk and return and then construct and manage a portfolio of individual securities, plus a few mutual funds or ETFs according to the client-specific guidelines and objectives. The portfolios we manage reflect a combination of BTR’s proprietary research and investment themes as well as the individual goals and objectives that are specific to each client. To the extent that assets are intended to fund retirement, education, or other needs, we work with our clients to plan their portfolio management in the context of these objectives.


	Long Term


	BTR focuses on a long-term investment horizon, which allows our clients to fully realize the value of our approach. It also helps us keep portfolio turnover low, which may increase tax efficiency.


	Thematic


	BTR invests in themes. We conduct proprietary research and develop a view on how value will be created across economies and sectors. Once identified, we invest in these themes through the purchase of individual equities and, in certain cases, mutual funds and ETFs.


	Value Oriented


	We seek to enter (and exit) investments at attractive prices relative to book value, cash flows, or other intrinsic measures. We believe this practice provides a margin of safety that will help mitigate downside risk while increasing the potential for upside appreciation.


	Focus on Quality


	Our research process emphasizes the quality of company management and a firm’s financial strength. We seek to invest in strong teams and solid balance sheets.


	Conservative


	We pay particular attention to the risk portion of the risk versus return trade-off.


	Customized


	We work with clients to establish their personalized portfolio guidelines and investment parameters. Each portfolio is then managed according to these guidelines.


	Learn More



+ Client Experience 



			We take pride in our high level of service and aim to be available to our clients when needed. BTR portfolio managers typically schedule face-to-face meetings for initial consultations, portfolio reviews, and planning. We make ourselves available by phone, e-mail, or web meeting to help our clients address pressing financial questions and to accommodate their busy schedules.
		




+ Asset Allocation 



			BTR constructs portfolios consisting of equities, fixed-income securities, and cash or cash equivalents. Each client agrees to a target asset allocation in his or her Statement of Investment Guidelines and Objectives as well as permissible ranges around those targets. This approach allows BTR to make tactical adjustments in the face of changing economic conditions, risks, and the flow of assets between market sectors, while at the same time generally maintaining a desired long-term portfolio allocation.
		




+ Equities Investing 



			We believe that focused, active management of equities produces attractive long-term returns. Our investment team develops proprietary themes that identify sectors of the market most likely to benefit from fundamental economic and social shifts. We invest in approximately 25 to 40 positions per portfolio in order to capture the value we expect to be created from these shifts, focusing primarily on sector selection. We believe use of individual securities also provides greater tax efficiency through low turnover (the average holding period is approximately three years) and typically results in lower total expenses as compared to most actively-managed mutual funds.
		




+ Fixed-Income Investing 



			Fixed-income securities serve as a portfolio stabilizer for our clients and we seek to structure such investments to provide safety of principal and regular income. Consistent with this approach, we do not attempt to use fixed-income securities to generate outsized portfolio returns and seek to avoid taking undue credit risk or actively trading these holdings. BTR-managed balanced and fixed-income portfolios typically hold 15 to 20 individual bonds of short-to-intermediate maturity that we believe are of high credit quality.
