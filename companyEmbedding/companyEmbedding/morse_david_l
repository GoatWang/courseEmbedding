David R. Morse
David Morse is the President and CEO of New American Dimensions, the nation’s leading multicultural market research and consulting firm specializing in analysis and intelligence on the “hyphenated American.” The company has pioneered in-depth research techniques that incorporate regional, generational, acculturation, and lifestyle factors to identify and articulate the complex consumer landscape to its clients. David and his colleagues have advised clients that include Fortune 100 executives, marketers, and key business leaders on strategizing and executing million-dollar campaigns.
David is uniquely positioned to identify the complex and changing attitudes of hyphenated Americans; he regularly travels the country to personally conduct field research as a focus group moderator. His 25 years of experience includes senior marketing and market research positions in the U.S. and abroad at Levi Strauss & Co, Gillette de Mexico, Southern Pacific Transportation Company, and American Honda Motor Company.
David is frequently quoted by the media such as The New York Times, The New York Post, The Christian Science Monitor, La Opinion, The Dallas Morning News, and the Associated Press. He often speaks to national companies, research groups, and marketing industry conferences about current and future consumer trends in the U.S., especially as it relates to how ethnic Americans are rewriting the rules of the marketplace.

David holds a Master of International Management degree from Thunderbird, The American Graduate School of Global Management, a Master of Arts from California State University, Los Angeles in History, and a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of New Hampshire, where he studied Psychology and Japanese Studies.
