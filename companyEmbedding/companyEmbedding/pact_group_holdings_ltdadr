What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Toshiba Bankruptcy a Nice Idea, But Hard to Execute

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

ADRPCTGY  No news for PCTGY in the past two years.         Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Can Pact Group Holdings Ltd’s (ASX:PGH) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average?



Michael Canly 


            				July 8, 2017			        


 Pact Group Holdings Ltd (ASX:PGH) delivered 25% ROE in the last year. However, to put Pact Group Holdings’s Return on Equity in perspective, we must compare it to the performance of its industry, which averaged an ROE of 10.12%. Although, Pact Group Holdings appears to outperform the industry, we can call it more efficient only after assessing the role of leverage in generating those returns and its sustainability based on current financial health. See our latest analysis for PGH 
What you must know about ROE
 ROE is simply the percentage of past year earnings against the book value of shareholders’ equity, which is the sum of retained earnings and capital raised through equity offerings.Any ROE north of 20%, implying 20 cents return on every dollar invested, is favourable for any investor. But investors seek multiple assets to diversify risk and an industry-specific comparison makes more sense to achieve the goal of choosing the best among a given lot.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

 No matter how high or low return a company generates on equity, it should be more than the cost of equity for value creation. For PGH, the cost of equity estimate comes at 8.52% based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model using the current risk free rate and a levered beta to account for financial leverage. That compares to Pact Group Holdings’s 25% ROE.


 Pact Group Holdings (ASX:PGH) Last Perf Jul 8th 17
 
                         When we break down ROE using a very popular method called Dupont Formula, it unfolds into three key ratios which are responsible for a company’s profitability: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. While higher margin and asset turnover indicate improved efficiency, investors should be cautious about the impact of increased leverage.

Dupont Formula
ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity
ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)
ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

 Among the ratios affecting ROE, the profit margin is the most important as it highlights the operational efficiency of a company. To a potential investor, the ideal scenario would be profit increasing at a higher rate than the revenue.The asset turnover for a capital intensive industry such as bricks-and-mortar retail would be substantially lower than the e-commerce retail industry. A comparison with the industry can be drawn through ROA, which represents earnings as a percentage of assets. Pact Group Holdings’s ROA stood at 7% in the past year, compared to the industry’s 5.15%.
 

 Pact Group Holdings (ASX:PGH) Historical Debt Jul 8th 17
 
 We can assess whether PGH is fuelling ROE by excessively raising debt or if it has a balanced capital structure by looking at the historic debt-equity trend of the company. While Pact Group Holdings’s debt to equity ratio currently stands at 1.75, investors should assess how it has changed over the past few years. To account for leverage, we should look at PGH’s Return on capital, which stood at 12% in the past year versus industry’s -2.65%. ROC is earnings as a percentage of overall employed capital compared to just equity as in the case of ROE.
ROE – More than just a profitability ratio
 On the surface, ROE appears to be a simple profitability ratio indicating the return an investor should expect. However, for a sound investment consideration, it should still appear good when a company’s debt profile, profit-revenue trend, and leverage are considered. What do the analysts think about Pact Group Holdings’s ROE three-years ahead? I recommend you see our latest FREE analysis report to find out!
