Background Information:


Scopia Capital Management LP »
Scopia Capital Management employs a fundamentals-based, value-driven investment approach across four strategies: a long-short equity strategy managed with the discipline of market neutrality, a long-short equity strategy managed with net long exposure, a long-only equity strategy and a long-short health care focused strategy. The firm seeks to identify investments primarily in publicly-traded equities (on both U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges), including IPOSs, but may also include options, derivatives and bonds that they believe will increase in value (or at least maintain their value) even in a falling market, and conversely to identify and sell short stocks that they believe will drop in value (or at least under-perform) regardless of the industry and the market’s overall direction. The long portfolio focuses on dynamic companies protected by low valuations relative to free cash flow, strong cash positions or valuable intellectual property and sensible business models. The short portfolio selects companies that the Scopia determines are not only overvalued, but also fundamentally flawed because of the poor prospects of their products or services.
