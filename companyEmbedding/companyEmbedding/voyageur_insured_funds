FREE FUNDRAISING






YouCaring is dedicated to helping as many people as possible. This is why we will never charge anyone to raise money on our site.

Start your own fundraiser today.
It's free!
Create Fundraiser







Our Crowdfunding Platform Charges $0
Most crowdfunding sites charge 5% to 10% in fees just to use their platform. We never have and never will. This is because we believe that for people facing life’s challenges, every dollar counts. With more than $500 million in donations raised, our free fundraising platform has saved fundraisers more than $13 million in fees.

0% fee















5% – 10% fee









Donation Processor Costs

All online fundraising requires a third-party credit card processor such as PayPal, WePay or Stripe. These processors allow money to be safely collected and transferred online, but they do charge small fees for this service. Each donation processor charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction.
This is not a YouCaring fee.

To learn more about our donation processors, read our blog post Which Donation Processor Is Right for Your Fundraiser. Rest assured, you can change donation processors at any time during your campaign. Simply contact us and we’ll be happy to guide you through the process.






Keep More of Your Money

When a donation is processed, the donation processor deducts their cost from the donation total. For example, if someone donates $100, the donation processor will take 2.9% plus $.30, resulting in a $3.20 fee. Other sites charge an additional 5% to 10% just to use their site.
YouCaring saves you money by charging no site fees.

How YouCaring Supports Itself

We rely on the generosity of our users to help us provide a free crowdfunding platform for those struggling with life’s challenges. At times, we do receive financial support from our amazing processors and other partners. People who give to fundraisers on YouCaring have the option of providing a voluntary contribution to support our operations and help keep fundraising free. We are incredibly grateful to those who have contributed and in doing so, chosen to participate in our mission to bring life-changing philanthropy to as many people as possible.

What is Crowdfunding?

noun
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or cause by raising money from a large number of people, typically through the Internet. It is a form of peer-to-peer fundraising that harnesses the power of social networks to raise awareness and draw donations from around the world for online campaigns.








How is Compassionate Crowdfunding™ Different?

YouCaring is a free online fundraising platform that pioneered Compassionate Crowdfunding™—empowering people worldwide to rally support for personal and charitable causes without the fundraising fees associated with other sites. To date, the YouCaring community is 5.5 million strong and has raised more than $500 million for humanitarian causes.
Start Crowdfunding








The Rise of Crowdfunding


The flourishing sharing economy is changing the landscape of fundraising, and in recent years, crowdfunding has dominated the scene. According to research firm Massolution, donation-based crowdfunding alone grew more than 50 percent in 2015, raising nearly $3 billion. The overall crowdfunding market, including donation-based, lending-based, reward-based and equity-based funding, was expected to grow to $34.5 billion in 2015, more than double that of 2014.







Recent statistics contributing to crowdfunding’s popularity:

Annual out-of-pocket medical expenses in the U.S. have risen to $400 billion, or $1,254 per person.1
Average medical deductibles in the last eight years have increased 100 percent, from $584 to $1,217 for individuals, not including the price of co-pays, co-insurance, drugs and procedures not covered by health insurance plans.2
Forty seven percent of Americans can’t afford $2,000 in an emergency
Annual charitable giving in the U.S. has grown to $360 billion, with 72 percent coming from individuals.3
The sharing economy in 2015 is estimated to be $15 billion and projected to grow to $335 billion by 2035.4





How can you key into the trend and help yourself or someone you love overcome a hardship or challenge by launching a successful crowdfunding campaign?


How To Crowdfund













1. Create
YouCaring’s easy-to-use fundraiser template allows you to create an effective home page for your crowdfunding campaign. Show potential donors how they can help by telling a compelling story, uploading several pictures and videos, and posting updates.



2. Share
Activate your social network. With just a few clicks, spread the word of your fundraiser to friends, family and other potential donors through Facebook, Twitter, email and other channels. Each share is worth $37 on average.



3. Collect
Donations to your fundraiser can be transferred into your account as they’re received. YouCaring provides free fundraising, which means we don’t charge a thing. The donation processor does, however, take 2.9%, plus $.30 per transaction.








Best Crowdfunding Practices
The most important goal of crowdfunding is to build a community and a network that empathizes with your cause and donates.






Five Key Strategies:


Plan Ahead
Create a social presence by setting up Facebook and Twitter accounts if you haven’t already done so. Immediately start connecting with as many friends, family members, coworkers and acquaintances as possible. See our Using Social Media to Promote Your Fundraiser page. Also consider setting up a blog or website devoted to your cause to further boost your social presence. See our How to Start a Fundraising Website or Blog page.

Make It Compelling
From the title to the story to the visuals, your campaign should inspire potential donors to contribute to your cause. Take time to create a great name for your campaign and write an engaging story. Uploading several high-quality photos and one or more videos can exponentially increase donations to your campaign. For additional tips, see these YouCaring articles: Great Ideas for Naming Your Online Fundraiser, How Images Can Lead to Fundraising Success and Videos Are Powerful Fundraiser Tools.

Share and Update
Sharing your campaign often via social media channels and asking your friends, family and others to do the same is the best way to raise awareness and support for your cause. Every share can raise $37. Multiply those shares and your fundraiser may go viral. Meanwhile, well-written updates keep supporters and potential donors engaged. Fundraisers with five updates can raise 15 times more than those with one. Fundraisers with 20 or more updates on average meet their fundraising goal.

Organize Offline Events
Complementing your online campaign with an offline fundraiser can get your community personally involved and rally support from local businesses. Sports tournaments, dinners, auctions, dances and other events are great options. See our Fundraising Ideas page for other tips.

Reach Out to the Media
Getting your campaign covered by a local newspaper, T.V. station, radio station or even blogger and Facebook pages can propel your fundraiser to new heights. See our tips page, How to Get Local Media to Cover Your Fundraiser.

Read MoreCollapse Strategies 






The Crowdfunding Platform You Choose Matters
It is vital to pick the crowdfunding platform that best suits your needs and your cause. The most important aspects include the fees charged to fundraise, the site’s customer service standards and reputation, the schedule for payment of donations, the caliber of online tools available to illustrate and share your campaign, and the quality of the site—from the visuals to the user experience.

Crowdfunding Campaign Success Stories






Help Save Matthew!





Goal: $800,000

Raised: $835,918



Matthew Schreindorfer and his wife, Katia Luciani, could not have imagined the journey they would face starting in August 2014. At age 24, Matthew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He had gone through every possible treatment in Canada, all of which failed to bring him into remission. According to his doctors, his only hope was to be admitted for a CART-19 clinical trial in the U.S. The couple started working with Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute in New York and started a YouCaring fundraiser with a goal of $800,000, the estimated cost for the treatment. With the help of family and friends in Canada, and newfound supporters in the U.S. and around the world, the couple was able to drum up plenty of support for the clinical trial in the U.S., which proved to be fruitful, putting Matthew in remission for more than six months.

And Luca Makes 5 – Mullen Family Adoption





Goal: $40,500

Raised: $41,259



In February 2016, the Mullen Family of Bethany, Okla., brought home their third adoptive child, Luca, a 3-year-old Eastern European boy with special needs. The joyous occasion came after nearly one year of fundraising, the majority of which included the YouCaring campaign, And Luca Makes 5: The Mullen Family Adoption. After 15 years of marriage, during which the couple was unable to have children, they embarked on an adoptive journey to grow their family, and brought Levi and Lia home in 2011. Their YouCaring fundraiser to adopt Luca raised more than $41,000. Successful strategies didn’t get any better than the Mullen’s over the course of their campaign, during which time they involved their children in many of the happy moments leading up to the last stretch to welcome little Luca.

Help Fatal Arson Survivor Safyre Terry and Family





Goal: $15,000

Raised: $432,249



The story of 7-year-old Safyre Terry stole the hearts of people around the world when a Facebook post in 2015 describing her wish to receive Christmas cards went viral. Safyre was a courageous young burn victim from Upstate New York who was the only survivor of a house fire that killed the rest of her family in 2013. At the time, Safyre was 5 years old, and through all of her medical treatments and ensuing challenges, has remained a bright, optimistic girl who loves life. Around the time of the Facebook post, a YouCaring fundraiser had also been started by friends for Safyre’s aunt and uncle, Mike and Liz Dolder, who are now raising her. The fundraiser was set up to help with the costs of medical treatments and other expenses. Nearly 10,000 people from around the world contributed to the campaign.

Bonsai: Half the Bulldog, Twice the Love





Goal: $1

Raised: $22,898



It’s hard to resist a cute black and white bulldog puppy. But when you see Bonsai, born with multiple rare medical conditions that left him with only half a spine and no pelvis playing with a big pink squeaky toy, still just as rambunctious and playful as any puppy with four legs, it truly tugs at your heartstrings. A group of individuals from Friends of Emma, a rescue organization, took to crowdfunding to give Bonsai a leg up in his treatment. The fundraiser has successfully raised nearly $23,000 to help pay for Bonsai’s medical treatments and a possible mobility device to give him an even happier and healthier life.

What Is a Mutual Fund?
Since the creation of the first modern-day mutual fund, the Massachusetts Investors Trust, in 1924, there has been a steady growth of mutual funds. Today there are around 8,000 mutual funds.1 Because of their convenience and flexibility, you might want to consider including mutual funds in your investment portfolio.
A mutual fund is a collection of stocks, bonds, and other securities that is purchased and professionally managed by an investment company with the capital from a group of investors. When you invest in a mutual fund, the investment company pools your money with that of other investors that is invested to pursue the objectives stated in the mutual fund prospectus.
As a mutual fund shareholder, you gain an equity position in the fund and, therefore, in all of the underlying securities. You share in any gains and/or losses of the fund. The mutual fund manager trades securities, incurring capital gains or losses, and generates dividend or interest income. Some mutual funds hold securities that offer the potential for capital appreciation. When these securities are sold by the fund, it distributes the profits from the sale to its shareholders in the form of capital gains. Most mutual funds will automatically reinvest your dividends and capital gains in additional shares, if you’d like.
You can redeem your mutual fund shares at any time for their current market value. The value of mutual fund shares is determined daily, based on the total value of the fund divided by the number of shares purchased. The return and principal value of mutual fund shares fluctuate with market conditions; shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Purchasing shares in a mutual fund can give you access to a diversified portfolio, often without having to spend a large chunk of money and time deciding which types of individual securities to purchase on your own. In addition, you benefit from having your investment managed by a financial professional. Diversification is a method to help manage investment risk, but it does not guarantee a profit or protect against investment loss.
Mutual funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information about the investment company, can be obtained from your financial professional. Be sure to read the prospectus carefully before deciding whether to invest.
