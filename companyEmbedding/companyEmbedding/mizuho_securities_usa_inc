(e) providing for ongoing training of appropriate staff.
Customer Identification Program
In compliance with federal anti-money laundering requirements, MSUSA has developed and implemented a Customer Identification Program (“CIP”) to identify and verify the identity of customers that open new accounts. The purpose of the CIP process is to ensure that MSUSA has taken reasonable efforts to determine the identity of its customers through documentary and or non-documentary means.
Notice to Prospective Customers
To help the US government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity who opens an account. When you open an account, we are required to ask for certain identifying information such as your name, address, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We also may ask to see identifying documents to verify your identity and to screen your name against various government databases.
Notice Regarding Entities Identified As Being of Primary Money Laundering Concern
Pursuant to US regulations issued under section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, 31 CFR 103.192, we are prohibited from opening or maintaining a correspondent account for, or on behalf of, certain Specified Banks. The regulations also require us to notify you that your correspondent account (if applicable) with our financial institution may not be used to provide the Specified Banks with access to our financial institution. If we become aware that the Specified Banks are indirectly using the correspondent account (if applicable) you hold at our financial institution, we will be required to take appropriate steps to prevent such access, including terminating your account.

Any questions regarding the MSUSA AML Program, CIP or requests to share information under Section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act should be directed to:

​​c. Research Disclosures
Compensation of Research Analysts
The research analysts principally responsible for MSUSA research report do not receive any compensation that is directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views expressed by that research analyst.  The research analysts may receive compensation based upon various factors, including quality of research, investor client feedback, stock picking, competitive factors, firm revenues and overall investment banking revenues.
Research Reports Prepared by Foreign Affiliates
MSUSA may distribute research reports prepared by its foreign affiliates.  Persons wishing to effect transactions in securities discussed in such reports should contact MSUSA.  Research reports prepared by our foreign affiliates will be authored by analysts employed by the foreign affiliate; such persons are not registered with FINRA or associated persons of MSUSA.  Employees of our foreign affiliates are not subject to the restrictions set forth in FINRA Rules 2241 and 2242 on communications with a subject company, public appearances and trading securities held by a research analyst account.
​d. Order Handling and Trading Disclosures
FINRA Rule 5310 – Best Execution
In any equity transaction for a customer, MSUSA will use reasonable care in seeking to obtain the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for the execution of a customer’s order.  In determining where to send customers’ orders MSUSA takes into consideration in, among other things, the size and type of order, the terms and instructions of the order, the trading characteristics of the security, the character of the market for the security, the accessibility of quotations, transaction costs, the opportunity for price or size improvement, the speed of execution, the availability of efficient and reliable order handling systems, the level of service provided by the market venue and the customer’s overall objectives with respect to the market conditions at the time of the order. MSUSA regularly reviews transactions for quality of execution.
Order Handling and Capital Commitment
The MSUSA US Equity Trading Desk (“MSUSA US ET”) may maintain inventory of principal positions to provide our clients with opportunities for enhanced capital commitment. To effectively manage these inventory positions and sustain immediate liquidity for our clients, MSUSA US ET may trade out of risk resulting from customer facilitation activity at the same time we may be handling your orders at the same price level.  MSUSA US ET will trade principally alongside a customer order to the extent that our principal activity either hedges or liquidates risk resulting from client facilitation.  In certain instances, principal orders entered in anticipation of future client demand may also be worked concurrently with customer orders.
Regulation NMS – Order Protection Rule was adopted to strengthen the national market system for equity securities. It requires markets to interact in a way that permits orders to seek the best available market.  The Order Protection Rule (Rule 611), is the primary rule that affects broker-dealers and requires broker-dealers to prevent “trade-throughs.”  Therefore, MSUSA US ET will be prohibited from effecting that transaction at a price that is lower (higher) than the best bids (offers) in the market, without first satisfying those better-priced protected quotations.
The Regulation NMS – Order Protection Rule contains various exceptions that, in certain situations, permit the execution of trades at prices that would otherwise constitute a trade-through.  In instances where no other exceptions are available, MSUSA US ET will use an Intermarket Sweep Order (“ISO”) to sweep the market and execute any better-priced protected quotations.
In any transaction where the firm commits capital, you may choose to decline the executions .resulting from the ISOs. Whether you choose to accept or decline the ISO executions, MSUSA US ET is still required to satisfy those better-priced quotations and the benefit of those executions will be factored into your negotiated price. If you accept the ISO executions, your transaction price will reflect the receipt of those better-priced executions and differ from the originally-negotiated price.
FINRA Rule 5320 - Trade Along, Not Held Orders
Customer orders received by MSUSA are deemed “Not Held” orders unless you (customer) specifically request and provide other specific order instructions.  A “not held” order means you are giving MSUSA time and price discretion in seeking to obtain the best execution of your order.
When handling “not held” limit orders for institutional customers, MSUSA is generally not required by regulation to display or protect the limit order.  MSUSA may trade for its own account at prices equal to, or better than, those of “not held” orders.  However, MSUSA is still obligated to provide best execution.
Handling orders on a Not Held basis also means that MSUSA may on occasion simultaneously conduct same-side principal trading in the same or related products while your order is outstanding.  Principal trading while in possession of a customer order is allowed and may occur with knowledge of the customer order, as pre-positioning and anticipatory hedging for the overall benefit of the customer order.
In the first case of no-knowledge, MSUSA has established Information Barriers to restrict information about unexecuted orders from other trading areas not involved with the handling of the order either as an agent or as a solicited contra-party.
In the case of pre-positioning or anticipatory hedging with knowledge and consideration of the customer order, your order to MSUSA may be marked as trade-along.  MSUSA holding a customer order are restricted from related trading except where pre-positioning is designed to enhance the overall execution quality for the customer.  Efforts to enhance execution quality by related principal pre-positioning can occur in varying circumstances. 
By way of example without limitation, when a customer seeks a guarantee to be filled at the closing price it carries the expectation that MSUSA may engage in pre-positioning activity in order to lessen the market impact of the block, particularly on the closing price.  Pre-positioning under these circumstances may diffuse the impact of a large block order by spreading out its execution effect over a period of time and perhaps over several different markets.  Another example would be in connection with the placement of a large ETF order where the execution of an anticipatory hedge in one or more non-option related products may serve to reduce facilitation risk and produce an overall benefit to the customer in the form of a superior execution.  It should be noted, however, that Exchange rules restrict the use of anticipatory hedges in the listed options market until after the customer’s order is publicly exposed or in the case of tied stock, where both the option order and anticipatory hedge transactions are offered to the option trading crowd. 
If you choose to opt into the protections afforded by Rule 5320, please send notice to

Execution Alternatives and Sourcing Liquidity
MSUSA US ET utilizes vendor developed tools (algorithm strategy) designed to access external and internal sources of liquidity to obtain the most favorable execution of your orders reasonably available under market conditions.  These tools include smart order routers that route orders in accordance with your instructions for orders placed with MSUSA.  These tools may also provide access to Alternative Trading Systems (“ATS”) that seek anonymous crossing opportunities. Please note that MSUSA does not operate an ATS.  MSUSA subscribes to various ATS and may also access such destinations via another contracted Broker Dealer.  Orders worked through any of the automated execution strategies MSUSA accesses may receive automated capital provision in an attempt to improve overall execution quality.  Given the variety of means that MSUSA may employ to provide your orders with the best possible execution, and absent specific instructions to the contrary, your transactions may be executed on an agency, agency cross, principal basis or a combination of these.
Regulation NMS – Rule 605 - Disclosure of Order Execution Information
Rule 605 states that broker dealers (market centers) must make available standardized monthly reports of statistical information concerning our equity order executions.  MSUSA has contracted with a third party vendor, SunGard – Protegent Trading Compliance (“PTC”), to collect MSUSA order execution data and organize the statistics. 
You can find these Rule 605 monthly reports at the following PTC website https://www.sungard.com/solutions/compliance-tax/protegent/protegent-trading-compliance/best-execution-order-routing. 
In addition, you find the URL link to PTC on the Mizuho Americas LLC website https://www.mizuhoamericas.com/disclosures
Regulation NMS – Rule 606 - Disclosure of Order Routing Information
Rule 606 states that broker dealers (market centers) must make available standardized quarterly reports of statistical information concerning our equity order routing information.  MSUSA has contracted with a third party vendor, SunGard – Protegent Trading Compliance (“PTC”), to collect MSUSA order execution data and organize the statistics. 
You can find these Rule 606 monthly reports at the following PTC website https://www.sungard.com/solutions/compliance-tax/protegent/protegent-trading-compliance/best-execution-order-routing. Use the drop down box to select Mizuho Securities USA LLC

Foreign Affiliate
Transactions executed in non-U.S. markets may be affected with or through MSUSA’s affiliate. Such affiliate may have acted as principal or agent and as a result derived compensation from the transaction. Additional information is available upon written request.
FINRA Rule 2124 – Net Trading
At your request, MSUSA may confirm equity transaction(s) on a net basis.  A net transaction is a principal transaction in which the market maker, after having received an order to buy or sell an equity security, buys or sells the security (from or to another dealer or another customer) and then sells to or buys from the customer at a different price.  MSUSA is compensated in the form of a spread added to/subtracted from the cost of the position.  The official confirmation for a net trade will reflect a single, all inclusive price and will not explicitly identify the spread added/subtracted.  In accordance with FINRA Rules, MSUSA will confirm your authorization orally to continue executing your orders on a net basis for each request made.
Indications of Interest
For the purpose of attracting contra side trading interest in an attempt to minimize market impact, MSUSA may utilize certain third party vendor systems to disseminate indications of interest (“IOI”) to other market participants or trading venues.  MSUSA will label an IOI as a “natural” if it is the result of (1) an existing agency order, (2) an indication of interest to transact in a particular security other than an order (in touch with) from a customer; or (3) interest on a principal basis that is being or was established for the purpose of facilitating a client order.  Resulting transactions may be executed on a principal basis, agency cross basis or a combination thereof. 
FINRA Rule 5270 – Prohibition on Front Running Client Block Transactions
Rule 5270 (the “Rule”) prohibits a broker-dealer from trading for its own account while in possession of information regarding an imminent client block transaction.  MSUSA employees are strictly prohibited from engaging in such activity.  Rule 5270 does contain certain exceptions to this general prohibition. The Rule does not preclude a broker-dealer from trading for its own account for purpose of fulfilling or facilitating the execution of a client’s block transaction. Consistent with this exception, you should be aware that MSUSA may engage in trading to hedge the risk of your block transaction using market data and other forms of permissible information that are available to us. This hedging activity may coincidentally impact the market prices of the securities or financial instruments you are buying or selling. MSUSA will conduct this trading in a manner designed to limit market impact and consistent with our best execution obligations.
Whether in the facilitation of block transactions or other services for which you engage MSUSA, we will not place our financial interests ahead of your own.
Extended Trading Hours
FINRA Rule 2265 requires that MSUSA disclose to you the following potential risks if you engage in equities transactions during extended trading hours (4:00pm – 9:29:59am Eastern Standard Time)

Risk of Lower Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular trading hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.
Risk of Higher Volatility. Volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the greater its price swings. There may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular trading hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all, or you may receive an inferior price when engaging in extended hours trading than you would during regular trading hours.
Risk of Changing Prices. The prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular trading hours, or upon the opening the next morning. As a result, you may receive an inferior price when engaging in extended hours trading than you would during regular trading hours.
Risk of Unlinked Markets. Depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities. Accordingly, you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system.
Risk of News Announcements. Normally, issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular trading hours. Similarly, important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular trading hours. In extended hours trading, these announcements may occur during trading, and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility, may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.
Risk of Wider Spreads. The spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for. Lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security.

​e. Business Continuity Disclosure
MSUSA has developed and implemented a Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) designed to address and mitigate the potential consequences of a significant business disruption.
Our BCP is intended to permit the temporary continuation of the key parts of our business despite the occurrence of a significant business disruption with a goal of recovering the key aspects of our business within twenty four hours or less. Our BCP also is designed to safeguard employees, protect our books and records, and provide ready access for our clients to any securities and/or funds in the custody of MSUSA’s bank depositories in the event that we are unable to achieve a timely recovery.
Our BCP tries to anticipate the various types of events that could interfere with our ability to operate on a normal basis. Staff have been assigned to specific recovery responsibilities and trained in special procedures to be followed should an event occur that could cause a disruption to occur. MSUSA has deployed an overlapping communications triangle that connects three geographically diverse locations to ensure flexibility and redundancy in our ability to communicate internally and externally. All mission critical systems have been duplicated in each of our data centers with data backed up electronically on a near synchronized basis at locations over 700 miles apart and also duplicated in physical form and sent to secure off-site facilities at the end of each business day. We also have deployed redundant communication lines from multiple locations with industry utilities, information providers, and clearing organizations. We have established alternative methods to communicate with our employees, clients and regulators.
We believe that our BCP meets or exceeds all industry standards and regulatory requirements. We further believe that we have implemented reasonable and prudent measures to overcome or at least mitigate the consequences of an event that would otherwise interfere with the normal course of our business. However, because it is not possible to anticipate the nature, scope, impact and consequence of every possible business disruption, MSUSA does not represent or guaranty that it will be able to continue or resume business operations within any specified period of time under all circumstances.
Our BCP is subject to periodic modification. A copy of the summary of our BCP is available upon request by writing to:

What's Next for ADAS? Opportunities in AI and Autos Loom Large

The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) continues to accelerate, with self-driving cars making more headlines than ever. Though tremendous gains in technology and public opinion have been made, there remain both barriers to adoption and opportunities for interested investors.
Technology in the Driver’s Seat
This time last year, we explored the expected trajectory of self-driving cars anticipated to develop over the next decade. Recent research from Mizuho, however, hints that the paradigm shift might be closer than it initially appeared, with impending benchmarks expediting the realization of ADAS technologies.
As a quick refresher, below is the framework from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for the five stages of vehicular automation, with Level 5 connoting fully autonomous vehicles.

“Currently, most manufacturers are either in Level 1 or Level 2, but all have plans to move to Level 3 or 4 in the next four to five years,” writes Mizuho semiconductor analyst Vijay Rakesh, who has been closely following the ADAS evolution for the past few years.
Despite the low levels of automation currently available, manufacturers have set the bar quite high for a ramp-up over the coming years. “70% of Global OEMs are expecting to launch Level-3/4 vehicles in 2019-20,” including “leaders such as Volvo, BMW, GM, Ford, Nissan and Honda.”
Furthermore, Rakesh sees 2018-2020 as the “golden age” for the automotive component suppliers as the race to master ADAS heats up.
LiDAR: A Visionary Technology
As you might imagine, a central component of creating cars able to drive themselves is a vision system – and one that will be more precise than the human eye. In fact, there is consensus among experts that Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is the technology primed to catapult ADAS into the next stage of realization.
LiDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light waves as radar instead of radio waves. In other words, a LiDAR-based sensor will use light movement to detect distance from an object with a high degree of accuracy. It is already used in a variety of functions, from ocean mapping to architecture to oil and gas exploration.
“The next leg will be driven by vision ADAS and solid state LiDAR achieving manufacturability milestones to accelerate the move to fusion ADAS systems with multiple domain systems driving safety and redundancy,” Rakesh writes, with ramp-ups in the U.S. and Europe expected to grow to 20-30% by 2020/2025. 
LiDAR leaders include Ford and Uber, according to Rakesh, with Ford testing 5,000-8,000 cars in the U.S. and Uber testing cars with LiDAR across multiple states.
A Winding Roadmap for Investors
When it comes to the read-throughs for investors, a few key companies come to mind. As Rakesh also noted here, certain players are well-positioned to gain from the large – and growing – ADAS market opportunity. 
For example, ADAS presents an alternative source of revenue for semiconductor companies whose previous sources of innovation and market expansion have been contracting. 
“Given the challenges and cyclicality in PCs and handsets, we believe the automotive market could start to provide the point of convergence of mobility, connectivity, processing and speed for semiconductor suppliers,” said Rakesh. “For NXP (NXPI), Cypress (CY) and ON (ON), automotive is now 35-45% of revenue, improving stability and better visibility long term.”
As Level 3 ramps up and LiDAR adoption accelerates into 2018, Mizuho expects benefits for Autoliv (ALV), CY, NXPI, Mobileye (MBLY), Nvidia (NVDA) and ON.
Consumers Waffle, Regulators Delay
Contrasting the advancement of ADAS technologies are public perception and regulatory challenges that remain barriers.
Evidence of consumer enthusiasm for autonomous automobiles appears contradictory. Cornell researchers, for example, concluded that Americans would pay an additional $5,000 for a fully autonomous automobile while also demonstrating that “demand distribution for self-driving technology was evenly spread between high, modest and low interest”.  And as Fortune concludes, auto dealers are best advised to offer flexible sales options as more robust automation features come to market.
Perhaps a more significant obstacle is present at the regulatory level, as officials have less incentive than the auto and technology industries to expedite solutions that will ensure safety and standardization while advancing ADAS accessibility. 
To put it succinctly, as Recode writes, many state “…officials are not even sure that federal rules and regulations can be in place by 2020 to meet the aggressive schedule of some automakers who want to have fleets of self-driving cars in major cities by then.”
With a futuristic vision for the roadway, ADAS presents opportunities for investors and drivers alike as technology, regulation and demand coalesce to create a fast-paced, competitive landscape that continues to rev headlines and bottom lines.

Corporate Corner: Corporate Bond Market Review Q&A with Victor Forte, DCM Syndicate Head, Mizuho Americas

Thomas Bausano
                                Managing Director, Mizuho Americas Debt Capital Markets

As we near the half-way point of 2017, I thought it might be a useful time to have a brief conversation with our Head of Syndicate, Victor Forte, to discuss his thoughts on the corporate bond market so far this year and his outlook on issuance going forward.
For background, 2017 corporate bond issuance by investment grade companies has topped $651 billion year-to-date, which is slightly ahead of last year’s volume for the same time period. Despite this record pace of issuance volume by investment grade borrowers, the spread that these companies have been paying over the corresponding treasuries to issue debt remains at multi-year lows.
Moreover, the nuanced execution dynamics managed by syndicate professionals have been largely positive. Concessions to existing secondary bonds to price new issues are low (or negative in many cases), investor demand for these new issues is high - as measured by oversubscription rates - and investor demand is strong across the ratings and maturity spectrums.
Tom: As someone who spends time with both issuing and investing clients, what are some of the key observations and assessments you are making regarding the strength and resiliency of this current market?
Victor: I am frankly as impressed with what the market isn’t doing versus what the market is getting done. Take the Fed funds futures contract; the expectations for a Fed move in June has been nearly 100% since the French election finished in May. Despite the market expectation for a rate hike, corporate bond investors seem unconvinced that the economy is strong enough to cause inflation and correspondingly drive longer-term government bonds higher in yield. What is evident is that we are still living in an investment world where investors feel that term rates will remain lower for longer, and as a result, their allocation will remain high to spread products within fixed income versus entering into a rotation back to government bonds or equities.
Tom: One noticeable issuance trend has been the rise in floating rate note issuance. What do you think is driving this?
Victor: On the issuer side, many corporates have been overly fixed versus their target mix of debt, so the ability to source floating rate debt as part of an issuance is attractive from a risk management perspective. A number of the more significant floating rate transactions have been components of larger multi-tranche offerings often associated with M&A, where a floater in the bond market is competitive from a pricing perspective with bank debt. On the investor front, the rise in LIBOR has started to make break-evens between fixed and floating tranches look better for the investor. Obviously, floaters are “defensive” instruments, and with continued expectations of future rate rises by the Fed, investors feel they offer some protection to their portfolios.
Tom: There are still a number of geo-political headlines looming between Brexit, QE in the Eurozone, China and global political elections. What is your outlook for the summer and early fall?
Victor: It is very hard to predict what might derail the strength of the corporate bond markets. History has shown that during times of heightened geo-political risk, we see investors initially take some caution, which causes spreads to widen modestly and new issue concessions to increase. However, investors have generally come to the conclusion that investment grade corporate bonds are really a safe haven asset class, offering some incremental yield to the risk free rate during times of stress. What I worry about is whether we are winding up the coil in terms of the suppression of government bond yields and that, perhaps, the Fed may be correct in their optimistic outlook for the economy. No one is really expecting a rapid rise in term interest rates and even a quick or violent move toward 3% could cause a lot of pain for corporate bond investors.
Tom: As a syndicate manager, what do you see as the optimal number of bookrunners and what are some of the key questions issuers should ask their underwriters during an offering?
Victor: Great question. I am a big believer that issuers and syndicate managers need to stay flexible and nimble during executions. I joke that I sometimes feel like issuers have heard certain “conventions” about best practices and the “absolute” correct way to execute their deals that seem to come from a handbook for an “Intro to Syndications 101” course that I just don’t subscribe to. Each deal is different and the result of each action poses different decision trees during the process. Historically, the most often used number of active bookrunners is between three and four. I think that gives enough varying opinions to help ensure best practices and avoid what some dealers term as “too many cooks in the kitchen.” I’m actually more focused on the diversity of dealers and having banks whose approaches to the market vary and whose skill sets vary as well. A lot is also incumbent upon issuers, not just on their dealers, regardless of how many. In today’s environment, I think issuers need to aggressively push underwriters to defend the validity of the secondary trading levels used to establish relative value. For example, issuers should ask underwriters to test how liquid the bond is, explain how it has been traded, and make them account for recent trends in prices. I also think issuers shouldn’t ask for “consensus pricing” until very late in the process. It only encourages groupthink and least common denominator thinking regarding the correct pricing level for a new bond.

Corporate Corner: Corporate Bond Market Review Q&A with Victor Forte, DCM Syndicate Head, Mizuho Americas

Thomas Bausano
                                Managing Director, Mizuho Americas Debt Capital Markets

As we near the half-way point of 2017, I thought it might be a useful time to have a brief conversation with our Head of Syndicate, Victor Forte, to discuss his thoughts on the corporate bond market so far this year and his outlook on issuance going forward.
For background, 2017 corporate bond issuance by investment grade companies has topped $651 billion year-to-date, which is slightly ahead of last year’s volume for the same time period. Despite this record pace of issuance volume by investment grade borrowers, the spread that these companies have been paying over the corresponding treasuries to issue debt remains at multi-year lows.
Moreover, the nuanced execution dynamics managed by syndicate professionals have been largely positive. Concessions to existing secondary bonds to price new issues are low (or negative in many cases), investor demand for these new issues is high - as measured by oversubscription rates - and investor demand is strong across the ratings and maturity spectrums.
Tom: As someone who spends time with both issuing and investing clients, what are some of the key observations and assessments you are making regarding the strength and resiliency of this current market?
Victor: I am frankly as impressed with what the market isn’t doing versus what the market is getting done. Take the Fed funds futures contract; the expectations for a Fed move in June has been nearly 100% since the French election finished in May. Despite the market expectation for a rate hike, corporate bond investors seem unconvinced that the economy is strong enough to cause inflation and correspondingly drive longer-term government bonds higher in yield. What is evident is that we are still living in an investment world where investors feel that term rates will remain lower for longer, and as a result, their allocation will remain high to spread products within fixed income versus entering into a rotation back to government bonds or equities.
Tom: One noticeable issuance trend has been the rise in floating rate note issuance. What do you think is driving this?
Victor: On the issuer side, many corporates have been overly fixed versus their target mix of debt, so the ability to source floating rate debt as part of an issuance is attractive from a risk management perspective. A number of the more significant floating rate transactions have been components of larger multi-tranche offerings often associated with M&A, where a floater in the bond market is competitive from a pricing perspective with bank debt. On the investor front, the rise in LIBOR has started to make break-evens between fixed and floating tranches look better for the investor. Obviously, floaters are “defensive” instruments, and with continued expectations of future rate rises by the Fed, investors feel they offer some protection to their portfolios.
Tom: There are still a number of geo-political headlines looming between Brexit, QE in the Eurozone, China and global political elections. What is your outlook for the summer and early fall?
Victor: It is very hard to predict what might derail the strength of the corporate bond markets. History has shown that during times of heightened geo-political risk, we see investors initially take some caution, which causes spreads to widen modestly and new issue concessions to increase. However, investors have generally come to the conclusion that investment grade corporate bonds are really a safe haven asset class, offering some incremental yield to the risk free rate during times of stress. What I worry about is whether we are winding up the coil in terms of the suppression of government bond yields and that, perhaps, the Fed may be correct in their optimistic outlook for the economy. No one is really expecting a rapid rise in term interest rates and even a quick or violent move toward 3% could cause a lot of pain for corporate bond investors.
Tom: As a syndicate manager, what do you see as the optimal number of bookrunners and what are some of the key questions issuers should ask their underwriters during an offering?
Victor: Great question. I am a big believer that issuers and syndicate managers need to stay flexible and nimble during executions. I joke that I sometimes feel like issuers have heard certain “conventions” about best practices and the “absolute” correct way to execute their deals that seem to come from a handbook for an “Intro to Syndications 101” course that I just don’t subscribe to. Each deal is different and the result of each action poses different decision trees during the process. Historically, the most often used number of active bookrunners is between three and four. I think that gives enough varying opinions to help ensure best practices and avoid what some dealers term as “too many cooks in the kitchen.” I’m actually more focused on the diversity of dealers and having banks whose approaches to the market vary and whose skill sets vary as well. A lot is also incumbent upon issuers, not just on their dealers, regardless of how many. In today’s environment, I think issuers need to aggressively push underwriters to defend the validity of the secondary trading levels used to establish relative value. For example, issuers should ask underwriters to test how liquid the bond is, explain how it has been traded, and make them account for recent trends in prices. I also think issuers shouldn’t ask for “consensus pricing” until very late in the process. It only encourages groupthink and least common denominator thinking regarding the correct pricing level for a new bond.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 22417 / July 19, 2012
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Mizuho Securities USA Inc., 12-Civ.-5550 (RA) (Abrams, J.) (S.D.N.Y. filed July 18, 2012)
Mizuho to Pay $127.5 Million to Settle SEC Charges of Misleading Investors in CDO
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged the U.S. investment banking subsidiary of Japan-based Mizuho Financial Group and three former employees with misleading investors in a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) by using “dummy assets” to inflate the deal’s credit ratings. The SEC also charged the firm that served as the deal’s collateral manager and the person who was its portfolio manager.
According to the SEC’s complaint filed July 18 against Mizuho Securities USA Inc., the firm made approximately $10 million in structuring and marketing fees in the deal. Mizuho agreed to pay $127.5 million to settle the SEC’s charges, and the others charged also agreed to settle the SEC’s actions against them.
The SEC alleges that Mizuho structured and marketed Delphinus CDO 2007-1, a CDO that was backed by subprime bonds at a time when the housing market was showing signs of severe distress. The deal was contingent upon Mizuho obtaining credit ratings it used to market the notes to investors. When its employees realized that Delphinus could not meet one rating agency’s newly announced criteria intended to protect CDO investors from the uncertainty of ratings downgrades, they submitted to the rating firm a portfolio containing millions of dollars in dummy assets that inaccurately reflected the collateral held by Delphinus. Once the firm rated the inaccurate portfolio, Mizuho closed the transaction and sold the notes to investors using the misleading ratings. Delphinus defaulted in 2008 and eventually was liquidated in 2010. Mizuho sustained substantial losses from Delphinus.
According to the SEC’s settled administrative proceedings against the three former Mizuho employees responsible for the Delphinus deal, Alexander Rekeda headed the group that structured the $1.6 billion CDO, Xavier Capdepon modeled the transaction for the rating agencies, and Gwen Snorteland was the transaction manager responsible for structuring and closing Delphinus. Delaware Asset Advisers (DAA) served as Delphinus’s collateral manager and the DAA portfolio manager was Wei (Alex) Wei.
Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
According to the SEC’s complaint against Mizuho filed in federal court in Manhattan, all of the collateral assets for Delphinus had been purchased by July 17, 2007, and the transaction was scheduled to close on July 19. However, around noon on July 18, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) issued a press release announcing changes to its CDO rating criteria requiring certain categories of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to be adjusted downward for purposes of calculating their default probability. The Mizuho employees knew that Delphinus’s actual portfolio contained a substantial amount of RMBS that were subject to the downward ratings, and that Delphinus, as constructed, could not meet its rating targets under these tougher standards. To enable Delphinus to close anyway, the Mizuho employees e-mailed multiple alternative portfolios to S&P that contained dummy assets that were superior in credit quality to the assets that had been actually acquired for the CDO. Once the necessary ratings were secured by the use of dummy assets, the Delphinus transaction closed by mid-afternoon on July 19 and securities were sold based upon these higher ratings. Investors were thus misled to believe that the Delphinus notes had achieved the advertised ratings that the actual closing portfolio would not support.
According to the SEC’s complaint, in connection with Delphinus’s subsequent request for a required rating confirmation from S&P, Mizuho employees provided and arranged for others to provide further inaccurate information about the composition of Delphinus’s assets. Primarily, they misrepresented that Delphinus’s effective date was August 6 rather than July 19. S&P then provided Delphinus with the ratings confirmation using the improper effective date of August 6.
As a result of Mizuho’s conduct, the SEC has alleged that Mizuho violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC’s complaint, Mizuho agreed to settle by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Mizuho from violating those provisions of the Securities Act, and requires Mizuho to pay $10 million in disgorgement, $2.5 million in prejudgment interest and a $115 million penalty, for a total of $127.5 million. The settlement is subject to Court approval.
Rekeda, Capdepon, and Snorteland
In the related administrative proceedings against Rekeda, Capdepon, and Snorteland, the SEC found that Rekeda violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Capdepon and Snorteland violated Section 17(a). Rekeda and Capdepon each agreed to pay a $125,000 penalty while the decision on whether there will be a penalty for Snorteland will be decided at a later date. Rekeda agreed to be suspended from the securities industry for 12 months, Capdepon and Snorteland each agreed to be barred from the securities industry for one year, and all three agreed to cease and desist from further violations of the respective sections of the Securities Act they violated.
Delaware Asset Advisers and Wei
In related administrative proceedings against DAA and Wei, the SEC found that, as a result of the roles they played in providing misleading information in August and September 2007, DAA violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and Wei violated Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, and caused DAA’s violation of Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings: (1) DAA consented to the entry of an order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, and requiring it to pay disgorgement of $2,228,372, prejudgment interest of $357,776, and a civil money penalty of $2,228,372; and (2) Wei consented to the entry of an order requiring him to cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act, suspending him from associating with any investment adviser for six months, and requiring him to pay a civil money penalty of $50,000.
The SEC’s investigation into the Delphinus transaction is continuing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
