JAMES M. EDMISTON
 

From the 1887 History 
		of Vernon County, Missouri, p. 551-552

Dr. James M. Edmiston

(Retired 
		Physician and Farmer, Section 20, Post-office, Walker)

   
Dr. Edmiston, an 
		influential and esteemed citizen of this township, formerly a successful 
		practicing physician but now retired from the active duties of 
		professional life, came originally from North Carolina, and was a worthy 
		son of Judge Samuel Edmiston, whose connection with the affairs of 
		Harrison county, Mo., are well remembered by the people of that 
		locality.  He (Samuel) was also a native of North Carolina, and during 
		life devoted himself to both farming and the manufacture of tobacco with 
		unusual success until the great crisis of 1840 came, when in common with 
		so many others he suffered severe losses.  When a young man he married 
		Miss Jane Gihlston, of Georgia nativity.  Subsequently they moved to 
		Harrison county, Mo., where the father was elected as one of the first 
		county judges, his official term lasting four years.  Both he and his 
		wife afterwards died there.  James M., the subject of this brief sketch, 
		the seventh of 10 children, was brought up to a farm experience, 
		receiving only a common school education, but soon after reaching 
		manhood he settled the determination which he previously had formed to 
		follow the medical profession during life, and accordingly commenced the 
		study of medicine under Dr. Watson, of North Carolina, resuming his 
		studies after coming to Missouri with Dr. Cravens, of Daviess county.  
		Following this he attended lectures at the Missouri Medical University, 
		and from that institution was graduated in 1848.  Returning to Harrison 
		county, Dr. Edmiston embarked actively in practice in both that and 
		Daviess counties, receiving a lucrative and remunerative patronage until 
		the outbreak of the Rebellion, when he enlisted in the 1st Missouri 
		cavalry, C. S. A. under Col. Gates.  For three years he remained in 
		service, but was then taken prisoner at Blackwater, Miss., and confined 
		for some time, being transferred several times, but finally receiving a 
		release at St. Louis on sick parole.  When the war closed the Doctor 
		located in Clay county and again resumed his chosen calling, continuing 
		it with highly satisfactory results until his removal to this county, in 
		1878.  He first located in Metz township and later in Clear Creek, from 
		whence he came to his present location.  Here he has an excellent place 
		and to his he devotes all his energies, keeping apace with all leading 
		movements and proving himself a valuable acquisition to the community.  
		He was married in 1849 to Miss Susan Morgan, of Virginia, who died in 
		1852.  Subsequently Dr. E. took for his second wife Miss Mary Petty, of 
		Knox county, Mo., and to them six children have been born:  Ida, 
		Mortimer, James, Dora, Ella and George, all of whom are teachers in this 
		county except James, a farmer and stock-raiser in Texas.  Mrs. Edmiston 
		is quite an extensive raiser of Tolouse geese and supplies a large part 
		of this locality with the product of these fowls.

James Edmiston


Born in 1943, James Edmiston considers himself a product of the British so-called working class - whatever that may mean. He was educated at Rugby and Brasenose College Oxford, where he had the utmost difficulty in finding time to read law. Apart from a thorough grounding in production engineering, he ran the world-renowned Sterling Armament Company for twelve years, with a degree of success that he claims was due to his various colleagues and loyal employees.He is married with four children and is a considerable athlete with no political axe to grind.
