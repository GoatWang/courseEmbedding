Vermont Lake Monsters Oakland A's Prospect Q&A: Steven Pallares, OFDonald Moore08/02/2015Oakland A's 2015 10th-round pick Steven Pallares is already showing his patience and versatility as a pro. Donald Moore spoke with the Vermont Lake Monsters' outfielder.In his first six weeks as a professional baseball player, Steven Pallares has proven to be a difficult out. The San Diego State product has drawn 28 walks in 36 games and has a .384 OBP. He leads the New York-Penn League in walks and is 13th in the league in OBP. Pallares is also fourth in the league in runs scored (24) and he leads the Lake Monsters in stolen bases with five in seven attempts.
After three relatively non-descript seasons at SDSU, Pallares burst onto the scene as a legitimate draft prospect with a monster senior season. He hit .352/.447/.523 and walked more than he struck-out. Pallares also drew national attention when he stole home to win a NCAA regional game for the Aztecs.
Donald Moore spoke with the versatile Pallares, who has hit up and down the line-up this season and all over the outfield.
Donald Moore: Hi Steve, how is everything going for you so far this year?
Steven Pallares: Everything has been going good. Obviously I'm making an adjustment from going to college to professional baseball, but it's been a good transition and it's been a fun one.
DM: What are your goals for this year?
SP: Just stay consistent at the plate and just have quality at-bats and stay consistent throughout the entire season. And help this ballclub win. 
DM: What do you feel is your greatest strength as a baseball player? 
SP: Being a huge team player, helping the guys around me and helping them to make them better and, in doing so, it makes me a better baseball player.
DM: What would you like to improve on?
SP: Definitely overall speed, running down balls in the gap or taking second base. Just overall speed.
DM: How are you adjusting to professional baseball?
SP: There is the transition of playing everyday and obviously nutrition is a big thing, so just trying to make sure off the field is in check and make sure that I am healthy off the field, which translates to being healthy on the field.
DM: What is the best thing about being a profession athlete?
SP: Maybe the bus rides? No, just being to play everyday and in college you don't get to do that. You play Friday, Saturday and Sundays and then Tuesday, so it's a lot of time when we are here, if you had a tough day or a good day, you just come out to the yard the next day and do it all over again. So I think that being able to play everyday and stay consistent.
DM: Any pregame routine?
SP: Yeah, obviously everyday is pretty much a routine and you got to get into everyday and you do the same thing over and over: pregame routine, pre at-bat routine, and the box routine and the outfield routine. It's just about keeping on the routine and developing it.
DM: Any hobbies?
SP: So far I like fishing and going cart racing with some guys. Hanging out with the teammates and getting to know these guys is a lot of fun.DM: Favorite baseball team growing up?
SP: Boston Red Sox.
DM: If there is one person that taught you the most about baseball, who would that be?
SP: Definitely Tony Gwynn. He was my coach for three years at San Diego State and he has definitely has the most influence on me as a baseball player and obviously as a hitter.
DM: Craziest thing you ever seen on a baseball diamond?
SP: I've seen a lot of crazy things but this past year I watched a guy hit a home run and miss home plate. I had never seen that before. And so he ended up getting called out and the inning was over. We came out running to the field to celebrate his home run, but he misses home plate and he's out. True story.
DM: Where do you see yourself in your future regarding your baseball career?
SP: Obviously to make it to the big leagues. I want to play in the big leagues and have a long career and get to play everyday in the majors and represent your family, too.

Stephen Curry’s product pitch in Oakland schools criticized

1 / 6


Back to Gallery
















Stephen Curry plans to visit a West Oakland elementary school next month, but the Warriors superstar and idol to kids everywhere won’t be promoting three-pointers.
He’ll be pitching water filters — an arrangement that critics say raises questions about the insinuation of advertising into schools.
Curry is scheduled to visit Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School on March 8, appearing at a school assembly planned and promoted by Brita, which sells a variety of water-filtration products. The subsidiary of Clorox signed a three-year endorsement deal with the Warriors’ point guard in December.



Latest news videos




 
Brita is inviting reporters to the assembly, in hopes of generating news coverage that would reach an even larger audience.
The appearance is linked to a national “Drink Up” campaign that encourages water consumption rather than sugary alternatives. The effort is sponsored by numerous for-profit companies that sell water or water products, including Brita — and encourages supporters to buy the sponsors’ products online.
While many sports stars visit schools, most do so independently or while aligned with a nonprofit organization or educational activity. Curry’s appearance is directly tied to a company and a product he’s being paid to endorse.
That’s a problem, said Josh Golin, executive director of the nonprofit Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which is based in Boston.
Branding is the problem
Events like this “are really designed to get kids to go home and nag their parents for the water filter Steph Curry is telling them to buy,” Golin said. “I would absolutely say if this was a nonprofit promoting water consumption I would have no problem with it. It’s the branding” that is problematic.
Schools have long been considered fertile ground for corporate marketers. Branding efforts have included product placement in textbooks, company logos on donated scoreboards and sponsorship of school events.
In recent years, though, many school districts have beefed up policies to prevent such activities from penetrating campuses and class time.
In Oakland, district officials said Wednesday that the Curry appearance does not violate a district policy.
While school officials are mindful of potential exploitation, the benefits of having Curry visit the school and encourage children to make the healthy choice of drinking water is a good thing, said board member Jumoke Hinton Hodge, who represents West Oakland.
“I think they’re going to hear Steph Curry say drinking water is good for you,” she said. “I can’t find a problem with it. I’m OK with it. I’m very OK with it.”
Isaac Kos-Read, a district spokesman, said, “We’re excited that a world-class athlete such as Steph Curry has chosen to highlight the healthy option of drinking water, and that he’s doing so at one of our West Oakland schools.”
Curry has in the past two years become one of the most marketable athletes in the world, with an estimated $10 million in annual endorsement deals. He said he chose to sign with Brita because he wants to promote water rather than soda or sports drinks. 
Curry chooses water
“Drinking water is essential to a healthy lifestyle,” Curry said in a statement announcing the endorsement deal. “Water is my drink. I like that Brita makes tap water taste good, so you don’t need to spend money or waste plastic with bottled water.”
Jennifer Harris, a food marketing researcher at the University of Connecticut’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, noted that there is “a lot of marketing in schools and most of it is for soda and candy, sports drinks and fast food. Water is better than all of those things.”
However, she said, Brita is pitching a product to school kids through one of their biggest heroes.
“A lot of companies want to be there, because where else could a company reach every child in that neighborhood?” Harris said. “In this case it’s just pure marketing.”
Marketing in schools is a corporate no-brainer, said Faith Boninger, an expert in commercial activities in schools at the National Education Policy Center in Boulder, Colo.
In October, when actor Jack Black visited a Minnesota school to promote his new movie, “Goosebumps,” school officials showed a preview of the film to students who donned matching “Goosebumps” shirts as local media documented the event.
“Schools provide a relatively uncluttered marketing space, where the child audience is not only captive, but is also … predisposed to be favorable to marketing messages that the children assume the adults who supervise them have approved for them,” Boninger said.
She added that kids “would also be likely to listen to and be favorable toward anything Steph Curry is promoting.”
Brita officials said Wednesday that they won’t be speaking to the students during the event or delivering any commercial messages.
“Beyond promoting Brita products, our relationship with Stephen Curry focuses on reinforcing the benefits of water as part of a healthy lifestyle,” said David Kargas, a company spokesman. “With his help, we can reach more people with the message that water is the best beverage for health.”
Principal Roma Groves said the visit aligns with the school’s effort to promote healthy living in a disadvantaged community
“No more sodas, not even juices,” she said. “We’re promoting water at our school.”
School gets filters
The district said the school is receiving a benefit from Brita, with the company planning to donate and install water filters at the school during the event.
Oakland schools get their water from the East Bay Municipal Utility District, whose supply comes almost entirely from a Sierra Nevada watershed. Officials emphasized there is nothing wrong with the water flowing out of school taps.

 WHat Our Customers Are Saying  


We had Steven and his crew come into create new patios and walkways throughout our backyard. They were on time, worked hard, and made our new backyard look wonderful.  We couldn’t be happy with the services offered, and all at a reasonable price.  Thanks for new yard.


 

                            	Elias H. of Santa Rosa                            	



I am so amazed by Steve and his staff’s professionalism. They did a completely awesome work on my backyard patio and front yard. We have a huge backyard where we wanted to have a 1500sqft patio with retaining walls, and we wanted a walkway for our front yard plus an extension of our driveway. The whole job was almost 3000sqft. We have interviewed many concrete contractors, and Steve gave me the best price and the most honest deal. It was a “gut feeling” I had for Steve that he was going to do a great job, and it turned out that I was right. Because of the large square footage and the details of the work, I was worried in the beginning and afraid that someone would mess up the job. However, Steve proved that he has the expertise and experience to make my dream a reality. Now we can enjoy our outdoor living areas for years to come! I want to say thank you Steve! Great job, great price, and great quality!


 

                            	Sandi S. of Alamo                            	



We have owned our Lafayette home almost 40 years, and have had numerous contractors out to do various jobs, big and small.  Not one of them was better, more honest and more skilled than Steve and his crew.  We had hundreds of feet of driveway and walkway replaced.  It was a huge project, yet Steve was meticulous about being careful with our landscaping and property.  He was here every day, with the job on time and on budget.  We feel lucky to have found him!


                            	Joel B. of Lafayette                            	



We have been working with Steven and his team for over a month now to plan and pour the decking around our pool, new patio, and walkways. Steven was always available to take our calls, come meet with us in the planning stages, and available to answer our questions.  During the work, he is hands on preparing, digging, feet in the concrete.  We are very happy working with him on this BIG project! Our decking and patio looks great!!


 

                            	Anne W. of San Ramon                            	



For over 10 years if have been referring Steve for concrete. People are always so happy with his work. Her does patios , walkways , stamped concrete, walls ,pools and more .You wont find anybody better or more reasonable than Steve.
 
 


 

                            	Jason K. of Concord
