Amendment
to Agreement to Contribute Stock dated December 28,
2011
This
Amendment to Agreement to Contribute Stock dated December 28, 2011
(this “ Amendment ”) is made as of May

Woodman Labs, Inc., the “ Company ”),
Nicholas Woodman (“ Woodman ”) and the
Woodman Family Trust under Trust Agreement dated March 11, 2011
(the “ Trust ”), and amends that certain
letter agreement entitled “Agreement to Contribute
Stock” dated December 28, 2011, by and between the Company,
Woodman and the Trust (the “ Contribution Letter
Agreement ”) as set forth herein. All references to
capital stock in this Amendment reflect the 3:1 forward split of
the Company’s capital stock in July 2012 and the
reclassification of the Company’s Common Stock into Class B
Common Stock in June 2014.
WHEREAS,
the Company and Neil Dana (“ Dana ”)
previously entered that certain Stock Option Agreement, dated June
28, 2011, by and between the Company and Dana (the “
Option Agreement ”), pursuant to which Dana was
granted an option to purchase 6,584,427 shares of the
Company’s Class B Common Stock (the “
Shares ”).
WHEREAS,
Woodman and Dana previously entered that certain letter agreement
entitled “Agreements with Respect to Compensation”
dated December 28, 2011, by and between Woodman and Dana (“
Dana Letter Agreement ”).

 
WHEREAS,
Woodman is Co-Trustee with Jill R. Woodman of the Trust and,
pursuant to the Contribution Letter Agreement, Woodman previously
agreed to honor his obligations with respect to certain capital
stock contributions under the Dana Letter Agreement through shares
of Class B Common Stock held by the Trust.
 
WHEREAS,
pursuant to the Contribution Letter Agreement, should Dana ever
exercise any of the Shares subject to the Option Agreement, Woodman
agreed to contribute back to the Company for no additional
consideration an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock
owned by Woodman or the Trust and the Company agreed for Woodman or
the Trust to do the same.
 
WHEREAS,
pursuant to the Contribution Letter Agreement, to date Woodman has
contributed back to the Company 1,906,247 shares of the Class B
Common Stock owned by the Trust (“ Prior
Contributions ”).
 
WHEREAS,
as a result of the Prior Contributions, Woodman and/or the Trust
are currently obligated under the Contribution Letter Agreement to
contribute a maximum of 4,678,180 shares of Class B Common Stock
back to the Company (the “ Balance Shares
”) upon future exercises by Dana of Shares subject to the
Option Agreement.
 
WHEREAS,
the Company, Woodman and the Trust now desire to amend the
Contribution Letter Agreement to provide for the contribution of
all the Balance Shares to the Company on May 11, 2015 in a single
contribution without regard to whether Dana exercises any Shares
subject to the Option Agreement on such date or in the
future.
 
WHEREAS,
the Contribution Letter Agreement may be amended only with the
written consent of Company, Woodman and the Trust.
 
NOW,
THEREFORE, In consideration of the promises and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other
