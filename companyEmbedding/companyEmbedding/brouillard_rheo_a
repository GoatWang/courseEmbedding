            Rheo Brouillard Receives Spirit of St. Clare Award
        

May 30, 2017





        
Newport, RI — St. Clare-Newport presented its Spirit of St. Clare Award to Rheo A. Brouillard, President and CEO of the Savings Institute Bank & Trust Company, in a ceremony held in its Harbor View Dining Room in the new building. The award is presented on select occasions to recognize those who embody St. Clare’s mission to meet the needs of elders in our community and provide the finest care and quality of life.   Rheo Brouillard, who has a long-standing commitment to supporting communities served by Savings Institute Bank & Trust, was honored by St. Clare Board member Msgr. Paul Theroux, for “stepping forward, embracing our mission, sharing in our vision and trusting in our ability to bring a new dimension of senior living and care to Newport County and surrounding communities.” Theroux called Brouillard, “an essential partner in shaping the ‘New St. Clare’ and lauded his role in creating a remarkable community resource that will have an impact for generations to come.”   St. Clare administrators cited the financial backing of Savings Institute Bank & Trust, a comprehensive study that made clear the unmet needs of seniors and community support for providing the impetus to move forward with this initiative.   Also recognized at the event were organizations and individuals who provided early substantial private support. These included: van Beuren Charitable Foundation; The Champlin Foundations; the Diocese of Providence, the Alletta Morris McBean Charitable Trust; the CharterCARE Foundation; Rhode Island Foundation; Savings Institute Bank & Trust; Jesus Savior Parish; Ocean State Charities Trust; and others, including out-of-state foundations.   St. Clare Administrator Mary Beth Daigneault outlined the major transformation of St. Clare from a small nursing home to a state-of-art elder care facility that provides the continuum of care from skilled nursing to independent/assisted living, memory care, a short-term rehabilitation center and an adult day health center.   “The new St. Clare has been years in the making and is still a work in progress,” Daigneault said. “The new facility is nearly complete, and we now turn our attention to the renovation of our original facility. When all is said and done, the overall project will total $22 million.”   “Over its 100 years of service to the community, St. Clare has been largely self-sufficient, something in which we take great pride. Our plan has always been to support this current initiative to the greatest extent possible on our own – and we can for the most part; but we will need some help. We are seeking a total of $2,500,000 in private support, just 11% of the overall project. Half that has been raised already with early support. We know that that Aquidneck Island residents love their community and cherish the values and mission of St. Clare’s, and we are launching a public campaign to raise the additional funds required. St. Clare has never gone to the community for capital or major support, but we feel that now is an appropriate time.”   Phase I of the St. Clare-Newport expansion is a 122,000-square-foot, three-story structure funded by a $15.8 million loan from Savings Institute Bank & Trust. It is designed by Durkee Brown, Viveiros, Werenfels Architects and constructed by Behan Bros.   St. Clare-Newport was founded in 1909 by the Daughters of the Holy Spirit. The on-site chapel was built in 1916 and renovated in 1932 and 1985. The current skilled nursing facility was built in 1970. A health care agency of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence, the St. Clare-Newport mission is to improve the quality of life for our family and community through care and service.
