Company Summary


America International Ventures, Inc (AIVN) was founded in 1998, to locate and develop natural resource properties of value. The company’s initial focus was on mining properties containing precious metals.This year, AIVN’s original founder, Mr. Jack Wagenti, returned as CEO & Chairman of the Board. AIVN’s previous management optioned the Brunner Mine in Nevada to Patriot Gold, and subsequently AIVN has collected annual option payment’s from Patriot Gold since 2008.

Today, AIVN has changed dramatically, emerging as mine operator via its subsidiary company, Placer Gold Prospecting, Inc. Just recently AIVN has acquired a very significant and robust collection of historical past producing mines in Nevada. This collection of antique mines comprises over 6,000 acres of patented and unpatented historical mining claims in Nevada, including its 40 acre patented millsite in Beatty, Nevada; the new home base for the Beatty Bullfrog Mining Co. (formerly “Placer Gold Prospecting").

AIVN currently has made plans to develop two worldclass mining projects in Nevada. The Golden Eagle Placer mines are in their first stage of reactivation and development, which started in May, and will continue until all the mining equipment purchased to start production is delivered, setup and running extracted minerals. The Company will use no chemicals at the site, only a wash plant fed from two high production trommels, a 100 ton per hour PowerScreen designed for placer gold and the other a 35 ton trommel capable of handling up to 200 tons per hour.

In addition, AIVN will start construction of its new Nevada offices, in Beatty, Nevada, permanently changing its physical address to Nevada, and continuing to develop its other world class project consisting of a full service shop, gold mill with EPA approved smelter, while obtaining permits for new mining operations over 980 acres of unpatented mineral claims controlled by AIVN and connected to its millsite, These mineral claims have some of the most important historical mines in the area that shut down in 1908, and remain undisturbed.

AIVN remains very streamlined, allowing us to be quick and nimble; able to maintain our ability to extract gold and silver very cost effectively, using modern state of the art technologies and modern mining equipment.  We pride ourselves on cleaning up the environmental problems left behind by the historical mining methods used in the past, by focusing our plans on gold and silver top past producers.

On some receivers you can even share apps with your smartphone. You can access music, photographs, your calendar, and navigation all on the receiver’s touchscreen. Some of the newest receivers offered in our online store feature MirrorLink connectivity, where everything that appears on your smartphone interface also appears on the receiver’s touchscreen.Just about all the receivers we carry have Bluetooth, for hands-free calling and audio streaming. Some receivers even have the ability to display text messages on screen, and some, when used with compatible phones, feature Siri Eyes Free so you can audibly receive notifications as well as send and receive text messages, make and receive calls, select and play music, set reminders, and get directions using voice commands. A great amount of receivers have the ability to receive HD radio. HD is a high quality digital signal that provides clear sound without static and hiss. With HD you can receive more stations, and get song titles and artist information without needing a subscription.Many of the receivers which we offer on our virtual shelves can play DVDs on their large touchscreen displays. Although most are double DIN, there are also single DIN units with detachable or flip up monitors, some as large as 13''. These screens will become a good solution for those who have children and want to entertain their kids with a movie or a cartoon. In addition, many of the receivers we carry have an input for a rear view camera, so the screen will display what’s behind you when backing up. We also have a comprehensive line of receivers equipped with navigation, which is updatable via smartphone. These devices can display detailed maps and turn by turn directions on the screen.
Large touchscreens are multifunctional in use. They provide the possibility to display more information on the screen than on a typical receiver as well as enable easier reading when driving. For example, when coupled with Bluetooth you can see caller ID, and if you have HD or satellite radio, you can see station lists with the type of broadcast they offer. Some units can broadcast Pandora internet radio via Bluetooth connection with your smartphone, and you can then bookmark songs and switch between your personalized radio stations using the touchscreen. All the features of the receiver can be displayed on the touchscreen, so you can select navigation, CD player, radio, etc.Featured Videos2014 Product Lineup01Digital Media Receivers02Kenwood® Stereo Reciever03Mitrax Life Style04Multimedia Unit05Guides & Articles StereosMarch 31, 2017Five Types Of Installation Hardware You May...If you're planning on purchasing a new car stereo receiver for your vehicle, you have a lot to look forward to.

Watch any new car commercial and you'll see that more often than not, instead of touting traditional attributes like horsepower, handling or fuel mileage, the manufacturer hypes the vehicle's connectivity, navigation, entertainment, and other electronic capabilities. The OEMs know that today's customers want access to friends and family, information, and audio and video entertainment wherever they go, including their cars. But you don't have to go in debt for a new car to get great automotive electronics. With our huge selection of car audio & electronics, your vehicle can equal or surpass the features in the latest new car and truck offerings, and we can supply you with these electronic parts at far less than you'd pay at electronics stores.
Bluetooth is the wireless interface that allows you to make hands-free calls from your cell phone and play music from your iPod through your car radio. We offer Bluetooth car kits and many of our stereo receivers and GPS navigators are Bluetooth compatible. We also offer many inexpensive wired and wireless integration kits that enable you to connect your smartphone, iPod or MP3 player to your vehicle. These kits not only let you hear music from your car's speakers, but you can also recharge your mobile device.
When it comes to audio systems, the car stereos in even some of the best vehicles are built to a price. The brands we offer in our online car stereo store are under no such constraints. They specialize in car audio and build components with one goal in mid: to bring you the best sound quality possible. We offer the best single and double DIN receivers with AM/FM/CD/VCD/MP3 and more, some with touchscreen and even the capability to display and play text messages, as well as car amplifiers and equalizers; coaxial and component car speakers; and subwoofers within and without enclosures. Car stereo installation used to be a hassle, but with our installation parts your receiver will mount easily and look factory installed. We have the dash kits, harnesses and tools you need for any car audio installation.
When traveling modern congested roadways, you need all the help you can get. We can keep you entertained if you're stuck in traffic, but better yet provide you with an alternate route with a GPS navigator. We offer a variety of units in various screen sizes and capabilities. All can display turn-by-turn directions to your destination, but many can also provide the aforementioned alternate route as well as restaurants, tourist attractions, traffic alerts, and lane guidance. Some units are even voice activated and provide voice prompts. And if that traffic has put you behind schedule and you're trying to make time on an open stretch of road, nothing can ruin your day like a speeding ticket. Be prepared with one of our radar and laser detectors.
To be useful, cell phones, iPods, GPS navigators and other electronic devices must be mounted where they're easily seen and accessible and we have the mounts to keep them within easy reach. While other car electronics vendors may leave you to worry about such details, we want to be your consumer electronics destination, so we offer these necessities and much more. You can safeguard your car and enjoy additional convenience features with our car alarms, keyless entry and remote start systems. In addition to triggering the alarm if the doors are tampered with, some systems also have glass break and proximity sensors, and for even greater security we offer dash cameras that can record attempted theft as well as provide evidence in case of a collision. Backup cameras have become an important safety feature. We have standalone systems as well as cameras that can be used with existing monitors to make backing up safer and connecting a trailer easier.

Stuck in traffic, unexpected detour up ahead? A GPS can provide you with an alternate route. Looking for a gas station, restaurant, hotel, or tourist attraction? Most GPS units are packed with points of interest. We have a large selection of GPS navigators with the latest features at prices to suit every budget.Our selection of GPS navigators includes touchscreens from 4.3” to 7” that attach to the windshield or dash. They’re powered by a rechargeable battery and come with a power cord that can be plugged into the 12V accessory port. Most come with maps of the U.S. and Canada preloaded, and many navigators include lifetime map updates. Just about all units provide voice guidance and the more advanced models include spoken street names in the directions.Some navigators offer realistic birds-eye views of junctions and 3D views of the surroundings to help point you in the right direction, as well as lane guidance with voice prompts to make sure you’re in the right place to make a turn. Traffic alerts are provided with some navigators so you can avoid congestion, and this feature is frequently free for life. Some of our navigators are Bluetooth compatible, so you can make and receive calls hands-free, and select units feature voice-activated navigation, so you drive safely with both hands on the steering wheel.
If you use your GPS in several vehicles, check out our selection of car navigation accessories. There you’ll find carry cases for transport as well as USB cables, home chargers, and many more useful accessories. If you’re not happy with the mount that came with your GPS, position your navigator exactly where you want it with an alternative from our wide range of GPS car mounts. And if you venture off the tarmac, you’ll always know where you’re headed with one of our portable GPS units. We have units that enable you to navigate by map or compass, create waypoints and routes and record track logs, and download geocaches.
At one time if your car was stolen, the prospects of ever seeing it again were slim. But that’s no longer the case thanks to GPS tracking systems. With a transmitter hidden on your car, you’ll be able to locate your vehicle on a map displayed on a video screen. Some systems even have a starter disable feature. These systems are also great if you have young drivers or employees that drive. You can see route history and also set up notifications if the vehicle exceeds preselected speed limits or drives out of preselected zones. Some also have a door unlock feature in case the car is locked with the key left inside.Featured VideosSmart Search01Holiday Commercial02Smartphone Link03Display Installation04TomTom® Traffic05Guides & Articles GPS SystemsDecember 20, 2014Advantages Of A GPS Navigation System In Your...Cell phone companies along with fans of the latest high-tech devices have routinely declared for years that dash-mounted GPS (Global Positioning System) navigation...Read all Guides & ArticlesGPS Systems ReviewsAverage rating:	   4.5 - 17 reviews  /  Read All GPS Systems Reviews4 of 5Magellan Maestro 4700Magellan® - Maestro 4700 4.7" Vehicle GPS Navigator, RefurbishedStill working on the instructions.

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!4.5 of 5Works Well, Right as ExpectedI ordered this unit just as it became available after conducting assessments of several units. Works just as expected. It takes a little getting used to the menu system, but after playing with it on two different occasions for about an hour total, I've figured out the more advanced items. Worked great right out of the box, quickly acquiring a full complement of satellites while I sat inside the house (accuracy within 10-14 feet inside). The screen has good color and is clear to read. I like the paperless feature and easily loaded a gpx file from geocaching.com. I find the ability to read all of the logs very helpful. Update: used it to search and find several nearby caches, and it worked great! It was very accurate and brought me to within a few feet of each cache. The receiver allows me to mark a cache found and to include comments. When I returned home, I easily uploaded my finds and comments to geocaching.com. I am very pleased with my purchase.TPosted by Terrence (Bethesda, MD) / February 5, 2014Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 4 users!4 of 5Expensive but the Best I've OwnedIt's expensive but it's the best GPS unit I've owned so far! The unit is easy to use, quick and beautiful. There are a lot of software/display tweaks in the 2013 line that alone (for me) make the upgrade totally worth it. I had a 3590 and I have no regrets so far upgrading to the 3597.JPosted by James (Grand Junction, CO) / February 2, 2014Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!4.3 of 5Like ItBeing already a happy user of the previous generation TomTom GPS navigator, I decided to order this Start 45. I like the mapping and the general accuracy. However, in two occasions it didn't read the number of the street house, thus forcing me to waste time asking. Also, I noticed that finding the POI is a little cumbersome.LPosted by Luke (Fresno, CA) / December 23, 2013Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 2 users!4 of 5Good Straightforward GPS Navigator at a Good Price PointVoice aside, the navigation is good. The Start 45 does a fine job of getting you from place you are to place you want to get using the conditions you stipulate: fastest route, shortest route, no highways, even the most economical route. The 4.3-inch screen is acceptable, allows for clear viewing of the map and the voice complements the visuals. I have not yet used it in the car to go to the downtown; I wonder to see if it will suggest me a better route than the navigator I have been using for the last years.VPosted by Vernon (Pittsburgh, PA) / December 20, 2013Was this review helpful for you?

With a high quality amplifier you’ll get much better overall sound quality. And if you’ve upgraded your speakers or added a new subwoofer, a separate amplifier will provide the power needed to get the most out of them. It will provide the power that the amplifier inside a dash mounted receiver just can’t deliver.Categories (241)Mono AmplifiersFeed Your Hungry Sub with Power(186)2-Channel AmplifiersMore Versatility & Efficiency(4)3-Channel AmplifiersPowerful Clear Sound at Any Volume(182)4-Channel AmplifiersBoost Power for a Rich, Full Sound(29)5-Channel or more AmplifiersPower to Drive Your Entire System(8)Bluetooth Car AmplifiersPowerful Music at Your Fingertips(45)Mini AmplifiersPlenty of Power in a Slim Package(62)Factory Replacement AmplifiersRestore the Power of Your System(72)Equalizers & ProcessorsCrossovers, Bass Maximizers(286)Amplifier InstallationWiring Kits, Booster Line Drivers, Noise Filters(57)Audio Power CellsCar Audio Batteries & Power Cells(55)CapacitorsGet power when audio system needs it most(51)Battery Terminals & Distribution BlocksPositive/Negative Terminals, Ground/Power Blocks(612)Fuses, Holders, BreakersFuses and Circuit Breakers(1,871)Connectors & TerminalsRing Terminals, Connector SetsFeatured BrandsLanzarBOSS AudioOrionPlanet AudioPioneerPower AcoustikAudiopipeKenwoodPyleACDelcoSound Storm LabAmerican BassPrecision PowerPyramidCerwin-Vegadb DriveMB QuartCadenceCrunchHifonicsDualSoundstreamPolk AudioAutotekBass InfernoSPLAmerican Hi FiRenegadeASA ElectronicsVDPAmplifiers are categorized according to classification, number of channels, and power rating in watts.

Class A amplifiers feature simple design, the highest linearity over other amplifier classes, and produce the best sound quality.

Class A/B amplifiers are a combination of the Class A and the Class B amplifiers, with a small amount of current flowing all the time, even when there is no audio signal, which results in greater efficiency with almost no distortion. Class A/B amplifiers are one of the most common used types of audio power amplifier design. In a Class D amplifier the transistors are switched on and off. Class D amplifiers are more efficient than Class A/B but produce more distortion. However, this distortion can be removed with a filter.Before choosing an amplifier for your audio system, you need to decide how you intend to use it and how many channels it should have. Usually, the number of channels should match the number of speakers in your system. As the name suggests, a mono amplifier is designed for one speaker, usually a subwoofer, however two subwoofers can be connected to a mono amplifier. 2-channel amplifiers are for two speaker systems, 4-channel for 4 speaker systems, and 5-channel amplifiers are for 4 speakers and a subwoofer. Some amplifiers can be “bridged”, meaning 2 channels can be combined into one for more power. A 4-channel amp could power two speakers and then have the remaining channels bridged to power a subwoofer.The amplifier’s power rating should coincide with your speakers’ RMS, or continuous power rating. If this rating is given in a range, go with the higher number. This is especially important to get maximum performance from aftermarket speakers. For best sound quality the amplifier should deliver at least 75% of the speaker’s RMS rating, and the average speaker can handle up to 150% of this rating without any problems. It’s always better to overpower speakers rather than under power them. The distortion caused when you make the most of a low-powered amp is more likely to harm a speaker than too much power. If you’re building a system from scratch, a small car won’t need as much power as a larger vehicle.
In addition to the mentioned above, there are other features that you’ll commonly see in amplifier listings, like filters and bass boost. There are high pass and low pass filters. A high pass filter removes low frequencies so the amplifier is only boosting the high frequencies sent to small speakers for high notes, while the low pass filter takes out the high frequencies, such as would be common when powering a subwoofer. Variable filters allow you to select the frequency to be filtered. Variable bass boost control allows you to increase the bass level to tailor the sound quality. Whatever amplifier you need, on our website you'll surely find the right product for your audio system.Featured Videos2014 Pioneer® GM Amplifiers01CEA Certified Hifonics® Brutus BRZ Series Amplifiers02Onyx Series Amplifiers03Versatile Hifonics® Zeus Series Amplifier 04Guides & Articles AmplifiersMarch 17, 2017The Five Most Important Factors For Your Car's...If you think car amplifiers are all about the bass, think again.
