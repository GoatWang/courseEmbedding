Divisions[edit]
DCI operates its businesses in the following groups: Discovery Networks U.S., Discovery Networks International, Discovery Studios Group, Discovery Digital Media, and Discovery Education.[26]
Discovery Networks U.S.[edit]
The company's namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985.[27][28] In 1991, Discovery Channel's owners acquired The Learning Channel.[29]
In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel.[30][31][32] Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS's stake, leading to its January 1999 re-launch as Discovery People.[33][34] The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.[35]
On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV.[36] In 2002, Discovery re-launched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with The New York Times.[37] In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery's 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater.[38] In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned.[39] Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009.[40] In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and ecological living.[41]
On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to re-launch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009.[42] In 2008, Discovery Times was re-launched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries.[43] On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to re-launch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel.[44][45] The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010.[46][47] After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.[48][49]
On October 4, 2011, due to the wider rollout of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was replaced by Velocity, a new "upscale male"-oriented channel focusing primarily on automotive-themed programming.[50][51][52] On May 28, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept by 2010 due to poor viewership)[41] was re-launched as Destination America.[53] In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in The Hub (then Hub Network) from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family.[54][55] In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications' cable networks.[56]

Group Nine Media[edit]
Main article: Group Nine Media
In October 2016, Discovery announced a minority investment in and strategic partnership with Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, and Discovery’s digital network Seeker and Sourcefed Studios, creating a digital-first media company in U.S. with 3.5 billion monthly video views.
Discovery Education[edit]
Discovery Education is a division which offers "standards-based digital content for K-12" In 2013, Discovery Education expanded its reach by acquiring Espresso Group Ltd.[72] Serving 3 million educators and over 30 million students, Discovery Education's services are in half of U.S. classrooms, over 40 percent of all primary schools in the UK, and more than 50 countries.[73]
History[edit]
After acquiring The Learning Channel (now TLC) in May 1991, Discovery announced plans in November 1994 to launch four new channels, including Animal Planet and what would later become Science Channel.[74]
In June 2002, Discovery Communications launched the first 24-7 HD network in the United States, Discovery HD Theater. HD feeds would later be launched for its networks in the U.S. and globally as the technology took hold in living rooms.
On March 17, 2009, Discovery revealed that it owned the rights to several patents related to e-books, in announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon.com, maker of the Kindle e-book reading device. The patents were originally developed by the company's founder John Hendricks; the specific patent in question in the suit was applied for in 1999 but issued in late 2007.[75][76]
On December 21, 2012, Discovery announced it had taken a 20% minority interest share with TF1 Group in sports broadcaster Eurosport, valued at €170 million (US$221.6 million).[77] On January 21, 2014, Discovery became the majority shareholder in Eurosport, taking a 51% share of the company.[78] In 2015, Discovery closed a transaction to acquire 100% of Eurosport.[79]
In April 2014, Discovery announced another digital investment in the form of a partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to launch digital studio, New Form Digital.
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.
In August 2015, Discovery Communications launched Discovery VR, a cross-company virtual reality offering, after announcing its plans in May
In December 2015, Discovery launched the company's first U.S. TVE streaming service, Discovery GO, connecting viewers with live and on-demand access to shows and series from several U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel and Discovery Life.
In Q2 2016, Discovery shifted its strategy entirely towards digital media, international markets, and diversifying content. In order to make up for shrinking cable network viewers, they have invested in direct-to-consumer offerings and digital distribution channels. 50% of their revenue was through affiliates this quarter. They took a minority stake in Chinese MCN VS Media, a company that has 55 million subscribers in China with more than 320 monthly video views.[80][81][82]
October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery’s digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake.[83][3]
2010 hostage crisis[edit]
On September 1, 2010, the DCI headquarters was the site of a hostage taking, a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee, armed with two starter pistols[84] and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building. Lee's motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.[85]
The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby.[86][87] The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people[88] hostage in the lobby.[86][89] The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated.[89] Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald's restaurant on Colesville Rd.[86] Lee was shot dead by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape.[90] The remaining hostages were immediately freed.[91] The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.[92]
James Jay Lee (c. 1967 – September 1, 2010) was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com,[87] among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of "parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions".[93] His manifesto also railed against "immigration pollution and anchor baby filth", leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an "eco-fascist".[94] Lee's opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis,[95] though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn's novel My Ishmael to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.[96] The Washington Post credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.[97]

Prior to September 18, 2008, DCI's ownership consisted of three shareholders:

Discovery Holding Company
Advance/Newhouse Communications which is owned with Advance Publications
John S. Hendricks, the company's Founder.

On September 17, 2008, Discovery Holding Company completed a restructuring plan. Discovery Holding's Ascent Media business was spun off, and the remaining businesses, Discovery Communications, LLC and Advance/Newhouse Communications, were combined into a new holding company, Discovery Communications, Inc.[17] The new fully public company and trades on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbols DISCA, DISCB, and DISCK. SEC filings are submitted by the Discovery Holding Company.[18]
In May 2014, the company announced a special dividend of shares of the Company's Series C common stock payable to holders of record of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock as of the close of business on July 28, 2014. As a result of the dividend, each holder of a share of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock or Series C common stock will receive one additional share of the Company's Series C common stock on or about August 6, 2014.[19]
Through Group Nine Media, Discovery connects with millennial audiences through digital-first brands NowThis, Thrillist, The Dodo, Source Fed Studios and Seeker, which has 3.5 billion streams per month.[20][21]
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.[22]
Liberty Global and Discovery Communications paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[23][24][25]
Divisions[edit]
DCI operates its businesses in the following groups: Discovery Networks U.S., Discovery Networks International, Discovery Studios Group, Discovery Digital Media, and Discovery Education.[26]
Discovery Networks U.S.[edit]
The company's namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985.[27][28] In 1991, Discovery Channel's owners acquired The Learning Channel.[29]
In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel.[30][31][32] Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS's stake, leading to its January 1999 re-launch as Discovery People.[33][34] The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.[35]
On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV.[36] In 2002, Discovery re-launched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with The New York Times.[37] In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery's 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater.[38] In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned.[39] Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009.[40] In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and ecological living.[41]
On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to re-launch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009.[42] In 2008, Discovery Times was re-launched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries.[43] On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to re-launch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel.[44][45] The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010.[46][47] After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.[48][49]
On October 4, 2011, due to the wider rollout of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was replaced by Velocity, a new "upscale male"-oriented channel focusing primarily on automotive-themed programming.[50][51][52] On May 28, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept by 2010 due to poor viewership)[41] was re-launched as Destination America.[53] In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in The Hub (then Hub Network) from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family.[54][55] In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications' cable networks.[56]

Group Nine Media[edit]
Main article: Group Nine Media
In October 2016, Discovery announced a minority investment in and strategic partnership with Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, and Discovery’s digital network Seeker and Sourcefed Studios, creating a digital-first media company in U.S. with 3.5 billion monthly video views.
Discovery Education[edit]
Discovery Education is a division which offers "standards-based digital content for K-12" In 2013, Discovery Education expanded its reach by acquiring Espresso Group Ltd.[72] Serving 3 million educators and over 30 million students, Discovery Education's services are in half of U.S. classrooms, over 40 percent of all primary schools in the UK, and more than 50 countries.[73]
History[edit]
After acquiring The Learning Channel (now TLC) in May 1991, Discovery announced plans in November 1994 to launch four new channels, including Animal Planet and what would later become Science Channel.[74]
In June 2002, Discovery Communications launched the first 24-7 HD network in the United States, Discovery HD Theater. HD feeds would later be launched for its networks in the U.S. and globally as the technology took hold in living rooms.
On March 17, 2009, Discovery revealed that it owned the rights to several patents related to e-books, in announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon.com, maker of the Kindle e-book reading device. The patents were originally developed by the company's founder John Hendricks; the specific patent in question in the suit was applied for in 1999 but issued in late 2007.[75][76]
On December 21, 2012, Discovery announced it had taken a 20% minority interest share with TF1 Group in sports broadcaster Eurosport, valued at €170 million (US$221.6 million).[77] On January 21, 2014, Discovery became the majority shareholder in Eurosport, taking a 51% share of the company.[78] In 2015, Discovery closed a transaction to acquire 100% of Eurosport.[79]
In April 2014, Discovery announced another digital investment in the form of a partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to launch digital studio, New Form Digital.
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.
In August 2015, Discovery Communications launched Discovery VR, a cross-company virtual reality offering, after announcing its plans in May
In December 2015, Discovery launched the company's first U.S. TVE streaming service, Discovery GO, connecting viewers with live and on-demand access to shows and series from several U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel and Discovery Life.
In Q2 2016, Discovery shifted its strategy entirely towards digital media, international markets, and diversifying content. In order to make up for shrinking cable network viewers, they have invested in direct-to-consumer offerings and digital distribution channels. 50% of their revenue was through affiliates this quarter. They took a minority stake in Chinese MCN VS Media, a company that has 55 million subscribers in China with more than 320 monthly video views.[80][81][82]
October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery’s digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake.[83][3]
2010 hostage crisis[edit]
On September 1, 2010, the DCI headquarters was the site of a hostage taking, a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee, armed with two starter pistols[84] and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building. Lee's motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.[85]
The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby.[86][87] The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people[88] hostage in the lobby.[86][89] The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated.[89] Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald's restaurant on Colesville Rd.[86] Lee was shot dead by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape.[90] The remaining hostages were immediately freed.[91] The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.[92]
James Jay Lee (c. 1967 – September 1, 2010) was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com,[87] among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of "parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions".[93] His manifesto also railed against "immigration pollution and anchor baby filth", leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an "eco-fascist".[94] Lee's opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis,[95] though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn's novel My Ishmael to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.[96] The Washington Post credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.[97]

Corporate governance and history[edit]
NBCUniversal executive David Zaslav was named president and CEO on November 16, 2006.[7]
In addition to Zaslav, current executives include:[8]

Adria Alpert Romm, Chief Human Resources & Global Diversity Officer[9]
Bruce Campbell, Chief Development, Distribution & Legal Officer [10]
Bill Goodwyn, President & CEO Discovery Education[11]
Paul Guyardo, Chief Commercial Officer[12]
John Honeycutt, Chief Technology Officer[13]
David Leavy, Chief Corporate Operations and Communications Officer[14]
Jean-Briac (JB) Perrette, President, Discovery Networks International[15]
Gunnar Wiedenfels, Chief Financial Officer [16]

Prior to September 18, 2008, DCI's ownership consisted of three shareholders:

Discovery Holding Company
Advance/Newhouse Communications which is owned with Advance Publications
John S. Hendricks, the company's Founder.

On September 17, 2008, Discovery Holding Company completed a restructuring plan. Discovery Holding's Ascent Media business was spun off, and the remaining businesses, Discovery Communications, LLC and Advance/Newhouse Communications, were combined into a new holding company, Discovery Communications, Inc.[17] The new fully public company and trades on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbols DISCA, DISCB, and DISCK. SEC filings are submitted by the Discovery Holding Company.[18]
In May 2014, the company announced a special dividend of shares of the Company's Series C common stock payable to holders of record of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock as of the close of business on July 28, 2014. As a result of the dividend, each holder of a share of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock or Series C common stock will receive one additional share of the Company's Series C common stock on or about August 6, 2014.[19]
Through Group Nine Media, Discovery connects with millennial audiences through digital-first brands NowThis, Thrillist, The Dodo, Source Fed Studios and Seeker, which has 3.5 billion streams per month.[20][21]
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.[22]
Liberty Global and Discovery Communications paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[23][24][25]
Divisions[edit]
DCI operates its businesses in the following groups: Discovery Networks U.S., Discovery Networks International, Discovery Studios Group, Discovery Digital Media, and Discovery Education.[26]
Discovery Networks U.S.[edit]
The company's namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985.[27][28] In 1991, Discovery Channel's owners acquired The Learning Channel.[29]
In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel.[30][31][32] Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS's stake, leading to its January 1999 re-launch as Discovery People.[33][34] The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.[35]
On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV.[36] In 2002, Discovery re-launched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with The New York Times.[37] In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery's 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater.[38] In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned.[39] Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009.[40] In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and ecological living.[41]
On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to re-launch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009.[42] In 2008, Discovery Times was re-launched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries.[43] On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to re-launch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel.[44][45] The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010.[46][47] After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.[48][49]
On October 4, 2011, due to the wider rollout of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was replaced by Velocity, a new "upscale male"-oriented channel focusing primarily on automotive-themed programming.[50][51][52] On May 28, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept by 2010 due to poor viewership)[41] was re-launched as Destination America.[53] In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in The Hub (then Hub Network) from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family.[54][55] In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications' cable networks.[56]

Group Nine Media[edit]
Main article: Group Nine Media
In October 2016, Discovery announced a minority investment in and strategic partnership with Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, and Discovery’s digital network Seeker and Sourcefed Studios, creating a digital-first media company in U.S. with 3.5 billion monthly video views.
Discovery Education[edit]
Discovery Education is a division which offers "standards-based digital content for K-12" In 2013, Discovery Education expanded its reach by acquiring Espresso Group Ltd.[72] Serving 3 million educators and over 30 million students, Discovery Education's services are in half of U.S. classrooms, over 40 percent of all primary schools in the UK, and more than 50 countries.[73]
History[edit]
After acquiring The Learning Channel (now TLC) in May 1991, Discovery announced plans in November 1994 to launch four new channels, including Animal Planet and what would later become Science Channel.[74]
In June 2002, Discovery Communications launched the first 24-7 HD network in the United States, Discovery HD Theater. HD feeds would later be launched for its networks in the U.S. and globally as the technology took hold in living rooms.
On March 17, 2009, Discovery revealed that it owned the rights to several patents related to e-books, in announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon.com, maker of the Kindle e-book reading device. The patents were originally developed by the company's founder John Hendricks; the specific patent in question in the suit was applied for in 1999 but issued in late 2007.[75][76]
On December 21, 2012, Discovery announced it had taken a 20% minority interest share with TF1 Group in sports broadcaster Eurosport, valued at €170 million (US$221.6 million).[77] On January 21, 2014, Discovery became the majority shareholder in Eurosport, taking a 51% share of the company.[78] In 2015, Discovery closed a transaction to acquire 100% of Eurosport.[79]
In April 2014, Discovery announced another digital investment in the form of a partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to launch digital studio, New Form Digital.
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.
In August 2015, Discovery Communications launched Discovery VR, a cross-company virtual reality offering, after announcing its plans in May
In December 2015, Discovery launched the company's first U.S. TVE streaming service, Discovery GO, connecting viewers with live and on-demand access to shows and series from several U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel and Discovery Life.
In Q2 2016, Discovery shifted its strategy entirely towards digital media, international markets, and diversifying content. In order to make up for shrinking cable network viewers, they have invested in direct-to-consumer offerings and digital distribution channels. 50% of their revenue was through affiliates this quarter. They took a minority stake in Chinese MCN VS Media, a company that has 55 million subscribers in China with more than 320 monthly video views.[80][81][82]
October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery’s digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake.[83][3]
2010 hostage crisis[edit]
On September 1, 2010, the DCI headquarters was the site of a hostage taking, a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee, armed with two starter pistols[84] and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building. Lee's motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.[85]
The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby.[86][87] The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people[88] hostage in the lobby.[86][89] The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated.[89] Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald's restaurant on Colesville Rd.[86] Lee was shot dead by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape.[90] The remaining hostages were immediately freed.[91] The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.[92]
James Jay Lee (c. 1967 – September 1, 2010) was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com,[87] among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of "parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions".[93] His manifesto also railed against "immigration pollution and anchor baby filth", leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an "eco-fascist".[94] Lee's opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis,[95] though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn's novel My Ishmael to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.[96] The Washington Post credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.[97]

Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Prior to September 18, 2008, DCI's ownership consisted of three shareholders:

John S. Hendricks, the company's Founder.

On September 17, 2008, Discovery Holding Company completed a restructuring plan. Discovery Holding's Ascent Media business was spun off, and the remaining businesses, Discovery Communications, LLC and Advance/Newhouse Communications, were combined into a new holding company, Discovery Communications, Inc.[17] The new fully public company and trades on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbols DISCA, DISCB, and DISCK. SEC filings are submitted by the Discovery Holding Company.[18]
In May 2014, the company announced a special dividend of shares of the Company's Series C common stock payable to holders of record of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock as of the close of business on July 28, 2014. As a result of the dividend, each holder of a share of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock or Series C common stock will receive one additional share of the Company's Series C common stock on or about August 6, 2014.[19]
Through Group Nine Media, Discovery connects with millennial audiences through digital-first brands NowThis, Thrillist, The Dodo, Source Fed Studios and Seeker, which has 3.5 billion streams per month.[20][21]
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.[22]
Liberty Global and Discovery Communications paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[23][24][25]
Divisions[edit]
DCI operates its businesses in the following groups: Discovery Networks U.S., Discovery Networks International, Discovery Studios Group, Discovery Digital Media, and Discovery Education.[26]
Discovery Networks U.S.[edit]
The company's namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985.[27][28] In 1991, Discovery Channel's owners acquired The Learning Channel.[29]
In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel.[30][31][32] Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS's stake, leading to its January 1999 re-launch as Discovery People.[33][34] The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.[35]
On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV.[36] In 2002, Discovery re-launched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with The New York Times.[37] In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery's 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater.[38] In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned.[39] Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009.[40] In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and ecological living.[41]
On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to re-launch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009.[42] In 2008, Discovery Times was re-launched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries.[43] On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to re-launch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel.[44][45] The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010.[46][47] After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.[48][49]
On October 4, 2011, due to the wider rollout of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was replaced by Velocity, a new "upscale male"-oriented channel focusing primarily on automotive-themed programming.[50][51][52] On May 28, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept by 2010 due to poor viewership)[41] was re-launched as Destination America.[53] In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in The Hub (then Hub Network) from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family.[54][55] In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications' cable networks.[56]

In October 2016, Discovery announced a minority investment in and strategic partnership with Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, and Discovery’s digital network Seeker and Sourcefed Studios, creating a digital-first media company in U.S. with 3.5 billion monthly video views.
Discovery Education[edit]
Discovery Education is a division which offers "standards-based digital content for K-12" In 2013, Discovery Education expanded its reach by acquiring Espresso Group Ltd.[72] Serving 3 million educators and over 30 million students, Discovery Education's services are in half of U.S. classrooms, over 40 percent of all primary schools in the UK, and more than 50 countries.[73]
History[edit]
After acquiring The Learning Channel (now TLC) in May 1991, Discovery announced plans in November 1994 to launch four new channels, including Animal Planet and what would later become Science Channel.[74]
In June 2002, Discovery Communications launched the first 24-7 HD network in the United States, Discovery HD Theater. HD feeds would later be launched for its networks in the U.S. and globally as the technology took hold in living rooms.
On March 17, 2009, Discovery revealed that it owned the rights to several patents related to e-books, in announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon.com, maker of the Kindle e-book reading device. The patents were originally developed by the company's founder John Hendricks; the specific patent in question in the suit was applied for in 1999 but issued in late 2007.[75][76]
On December 21, 2012, Discovery announced it had taken a 20% minority interest share with TF1 Group in sports broadcaster Eurosport, valued at €170 million (US$221.6 million).[77] On January 21, 2014, Discovery became the majority shareholder in Eurosport, taking a 51% share of the company.[78] In 2015, Discovery closed a transaction to acquire 100% of Eurosport.[79]
In April 2014, Discovery announced another digital investment in the form of a partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to launch digital studio, New Form Digital.
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.
In August 2015, Discovery Communications launched Discovery VR, a cross-company virtual reality offering, after announcing its plans in May
In December 2015, Discovery launched the company's first U.S. TVE streaming service, Discovery GO, connecting viewers with live and on-demand access to shows and series from several U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel and Discovery Life.
In Q2 2016, Discovery shifted its strategy entirely towards digital media, international markets, and diversifying content. In order to make up for shrinking cable network viewers, they have invested in direct-to-consumer offerings and digital distribution channels. 50% of their revenue was through affiliates this quarter. They took a minority stake in Chinese MCN VS Media, a company that has 55 million subscribers in China with more than 320 monthly video views.[80][81][82]
October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery’s digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake.[83][3]
2010 hostage crisis[edit]
On September 1, 2010, the DCI headquarters was the site of a hostage taking, a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee, armed with two starter pistols[84] and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building. Lee's motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.[85]
The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby.[86][87] The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people[88] hostage in the lobby.[86][89] The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated.[89] Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald's restaurant on Colesville Rd.[86] Lee was shot dead by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape.[90] The remaining hostages were immediately freed.[91] The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.[92]
James Jay Lee (c. 1967 – September 1, 2010) was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com,[87] among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of "parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions".[93] His manifesto also railed against "immigration pollution and anchor baby filth", leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an "eco-fascist".[94] Lee's opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis,[95] though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn's novel My Ishmael to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.[96] The Washington Post credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.[97]

Divisions[edit]
DCI operates its businesses in the following groups: Discovery Networks U.S., Discovery Networks International, Discovery Studios Group, Discovery Digital Media, and Discovery Education.[26]
Discovery Networks U.S.[edit]
The company's namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985.[27][28] In 1991, Discovery Channel's owners acquired The Learning Channel.[29]
In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel.[30][31][32] Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS's stake, leading to its January 1999 re-launch as Discovery People.[33][34] The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.[35]
On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV.[36] In 2002, Discovery re-launched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with The New York Times.[37] In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery's 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater.[38] In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned.[39] Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009.[40] In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and ecological living.[41]
On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to re-launch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009.[42] In 2008, Discovery Times was re-launched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries.[43] On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to re-launch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel.[44][45] The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010.[46][47] After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.[48][49]
On October 4, 2011, due to the wider rollout of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was replaced by Velocity, a new "upscale male"-oriented channel focusing primarily on automotive-themed programming.[50][51][52] On May 28, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept by 2010 due to poor viewership)[41] was re-launched as Destination America.[53] In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in The Hub (then Hub Network) from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family.[54][55] In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications' cable networks.[56]

Group Nine Media[edit]
Main article: Group Nine Media
In October 2016, Discovery announced a minority investment in and strategic partnership with Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, and Discovery’s digital network Seeker and Sourcefed Studios, creating a digital-first media company in U.S. with 3.5 billion monthly video views.
Discovery Education[edit]
Discovery Education is a division which offers "standards-based digital content for K-12" In 2013, Discovery Education expanded its reach by acquiring Espresso Group Ltd.[72] Serving 3 million educators and over 30 million students, Discovery Education's services are in half of U.S. classrooms, over 40 percent of all primary schools in the UK, and more than 50 countries.[73]
History[edit]
After acquiring The Learning Channel (now TLC) in May 1991, Discovery announced plans in November 1994 to launch four new channels, including Animal Planet and what would later become Science Channel.[74]
In June 2002, Discovery Communications launched the first 24-7 HD network in the United States, Discovery HD Theater. HD feeds would later be launched for its networks in the U.S. and globally as the technology took hold in living rooms.
On March 17, 2009, Discovery revealed that it owned the rights to several patents related to e-books, in announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon.com, maker of the Kindle e-book reading device. The patents were originally developed by the company's founder John Hendricks; the specific patent in question in the suit was applied for in 1999 but issued in late 2007.[75][76]
On December 21, 2012, Discovery announced it had taken a 20% minority interest share with TF1 Group in sports broadcaster Eurosport, valued at €170 million (US$221.6 million).[77] On January 21, 2014, Discovery became the majority shareholder in Eurosport, taking a 51% share of the company.[78] In 2015, Discovery closed a transaction to acquire 100% of Eurosport.[79]
In April 2014, Discovery announced another digital investment in the form of a partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to launch digital studio, New Form Digital.
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.
In August 2015, Discovery Communications launched Discovery VR, a cross-company virtual reality offering, after announcing its plans in May
In December 2015, Discovery launched the company's first U.S. TVE streaming service, Discovery GO, connecting viewers with live and on-demand access to shows and series from several U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel and Discovery Life.
In Q2 2016, Discovery shifted its strategy entirely towards digital media, international markets, and diversifying content. In order to make up for shrinking cable network viewers, they have invested in direct-to-consumer offerings and digital distribution channels. 50% of their revenue was through affiliates this quarter. They took a minority stake in Chinese MCN VS Media, a company that has 55 million subscribers in China with more than 320 monthly video views.[80][81][82]
October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery’s digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake.[83][3]
2010 hostage crisis[edit]
On September 1, 2010, the DCI headquarters was the site of a hostage taking, a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee, armed with two starter pistols[84] and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building. Lee's motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.[85]
The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby.[86][87] The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people[88] hostage in the lobby.[86][89] The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated.[89] Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald's restaurant on Colesville Rd.[86] Lee was shot dead by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape.[90] The remaining hostages were immediately freed.[91] The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.[92]
James Jay Lee (c. 1967 – September 1, 2010) was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com,[87] among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of "parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions".[93] His manifesto also railed against "immigration pollution and anchor baby filth", leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an "eco-fascist".[94] Lee's opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis,[95] though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn's novel My Ishmael to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.[96] The Washington Post credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.[97]

Company Perspectives:

Discovery Communications, Inc. is the leading global real world media and entertainment company, creating the highest quality content and services to help people explore their world and satisfy their curiosity.
History of Discovery Communications, Inc.








Discovery Communications, Inc. (DCI) is a leading player in the global cable television market. The company operates 33 channels worldwide including the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, The Learning Channel, Discovery Health, and the Travel Channel. Discovery Communications also sells videos, CD-ROMs, magazines, and books; runs web sites; and operates 165 retail stores. The privately held company is owned by a group consisting of Liberty Media Corporation (formerly a unit of Tele-Communications, Inc.), Advance/Newhouse Communications, Cox Cable Communications, Inc., and company founder and CEO John Hendricks.

Beginnings

The company known as Discovery Communications, Inc. traces its roots to 1982, when a University of Alabama history graduate named John Hendricks founded the Cable Educational Network, Inc. in Maryland. The new company's goal was to help present informational and documentary programming on television. Hendricks, a West Virginia native, had earlier founded a consulting firm that assisted producers of educational videos with marketing. In 1985, after raising $5 million, Hendricks's small company launched a new cable television network, which was dubbed the Discovery Channel. Discovery, which initially broadcast a variety of licensed documentaries but no original programming, was available in only 156,000 households.
The new channel's revenues were small, and within six months Hendricks owed $1 million to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) but had only $5,000 in the bank. Desperate for funding, he sought out new investors. Alhough he was turned down by the large entertainment companies he approached, he was able to convince a group of cable operators led by Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), Cox Cable Communications, Inc., and Newhouse Broadcasting Corp. to take a flyer on the network, retaining ownership of 1.4 percent for himself. TCI (whose stake later was transferred to Liberty Media) owned 49 percent, with Newhouse (later known as Advance/Newhouse) and Cox holding a quarter each. The company now was able to pay its creditors, and the new investors also boosted Discovery's audience base when they added the channel to their systems.
By its first anniversary in June 1986, Discovery counted seven million subscribers. Over the next several years the company broadened its range of programming, with events such as the February 1987 broadcast of 66 hours of live Russian television, gaining the company wider media interest. Discovery also lengthened its schedule to 18 hours per day from 12 during the year.
By 1988 Discovery's growing subscriber base had hit 32 million. The following year saw the company offer its first overseas cable service, with some 200,000 subscribers in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia receiving Discovery Channel Europe. In addition, 1989 was the year Discovery commissioned its first original programming, having heretofore relied exclusively on material from outside sources, among them the BBC. One new show, "Assignment Discovery," was a daily, one-hour program designed to be used in school classrooms. In 1990 Discovery expanded its overseas operations to Israel and began to sell videos through the newly created Discovery Interactive Library unit. The company, which had employed only 19 when the channel first went on the air, now had a staff of more than 250.

1991 Acquisition of The Learning Channel

In June 1991 the company purchased The Learning Channel (TLC) for $30 million. TLC had 15.2 million subscribers at the time of the acquisition, but was struggling financially. In October a new programming schedule for TLC was announced, replacing its lineup of business and career information, self-help, and hobby programs with 18 hours of educational and entertainment programming aimed at an upscale adult audience. The following spring a six-hour block of children's programming was added. October 1991 also saw the company renamed Discovery Communications, Inc. (DCI).
The future of cable was expected to encompass as many as 500 channels, and John Hendricks began giving thought to ways to deal with so many options. Announced in late 1992, Your Choice TV, Inc. was a new subsidiary that offered a prototype cable remote control device that could organize the hundreds of choices into 11 thematic categories for ease of use. Over the next several years the Your Choice efforts also began to focus on creating a time-shifting service through which unused channels would broadcast paid repeats of selected programs for individual viewers. Experiments were carried out on eight cable systems with some success, but the concept faced great logistical hurdles, primarily the problem of reaching agreements with the numerous content providers.
In the fall of 1993 DCI released its first CD-ROM, "In the Company of Whales," which was based on the hugely popular documentary of the same name shown on the Discovery Channel. Discovery now was producing more original programming than ever before, though the company did not have its own production company, but rather contracted with outside firms for all of its shows. Popular offerings around this time included specials marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy D-Day invasion and the 25th anniversary of the resignation of Richard Nixon. The network was available in 62 million homes by 1994, or 98 percent of U.S. households with cable TV. The Learning Channel also had doubled its own subscriber base to 30 million homes.
During 1994 the Federal Communications Commission relaxed its regulations for cable broadcasters, allowing them to add more channels and charge more for their services. DCI responded by announcing that it would form four new channels in 1995, including ones on nature, science, history, and a home improvement/cooking combination. The barrier to new cable channels was high, however, and a successful launch could require an investment of $200 million or more in cable system fees to get enough subscribers to make the service pay off.

Expansion into Retail in the Mid-1990s

In 1995 DCI spent $10 million to buy the coincidentally named Discovery Store Inc. chain of 11 Texas and southeastern U.S. educational and learning product stores. DCI already had begun selling its own licensed items through such stores as PetsMart and The Nature Company, and the deal was seen as a good fit with its expansion into marketing. Plans soon were laid to add more locations to the chain. DCI also was increasing its advertising, which featured the tag line, "Explore Your World." By 1995 $20 million was being budgeted annually. In some cases DCI used highly targeted campaigns, such as one for a special on submarines that was promoted through U.S. military publications. When the program aired, it received the highest prime-time ratings to date for the Discovery Channel.
The company's brand-building strategy was working well, as was shown in a 1995 study by Total Research Corp., which ranked Discovery second only to the National Geographic Society in consumer perception of brand quality. The company finished ahead of such major names as AT&T, IBM, and the Wall Street Journal in the process. DCI also launched a web site during 1995, earmarking $10 million for the project. The result was an award-winning combination of original articles, video and sound clips, and more. Earlier, DCI had begun publishing a magazine that also complemented its programming.








During the mid-1990s DCI began to focus increasingly on overseas expansion. In 1994 the company launched spinoff channels in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, followed in 1995 by others in Canada, India, and Australia/New Zealand. More were added later in Italy, Africa, Brazil, Germany, Japan, and Turkey. Channels ultimately would be available in 150 countries. Dubbing the company's documentary and informational programs into foreign languages was typically much less expensive, and less complicated, than creating foreign versions of dramatic material, and much of the subject matter was universal, appealing equally well to viewers throughout the world. During this period DCI also announced a move into feature film production, forming a new subsidiary for this purpose that was expected to issue one or two titles per year, including some shot in the large-format Imax process.
In February 1996 DCI announced a joint venture with one of its investors, Tele-Communications, Inc. The new company, ETC w/TCI, would offer seven hours of commercial-free cable programming directly to schools, including some material taken from the Discovery and Learning Channels. Former U.S. Congressman Tony Coelho was named chairman and CEO. The new company, which initially targeted some 700 large schools nationwide, planned to charge $265 a year per student for the service. The fee also would cover installation of the necessary hardware and software, as well as training on its use.
A short time after this, DCI broadened its retail presence with the $40 million acquisition of The Nature Company's chain of 110 stores in 34 states. Over time the stores were to be rebranded as Discovery Channel Stores. The move was in line with what other large media companies such as Disney and Warner Brothers were attempting—operating chains of stores that served to bolster brand identity while also trading on public familiarity with the name. A new 25,000-square-foot flagship superstore was soon announced for the Washington, D.C. area, near DCI's Bethesda, Maryland headquarters. Typical stores in the chain were smaller, falling in the range of 3,000 to 5,000 square feet.
In October 1996 two other major steps were taken by DCI. One was a new partnership with the British Broadcasting Corporation to produce a BBC-branded cable channel in the United States. BBC America would feature the respected dramatic and performing arts programming for which the British company was known, with DCI handling the logistics and also contributing some of the content. DCI anticipated spending more than $500 million over a five-year period on the deal, which would possibly include other cable channels and the programming necessary to flesh them out. DCI also was given "first look" options on new BBC programming, putting the company ahead of such competitors as the Arts & Entertainment and Public Broadcasting networks.

Creation of Animal Planet in the Mid-1990s

At the same time the company launched Animal Planet, a new cable channel focusing on both domestic and wild animals, which was 20 percent owned by the BBC. After its launch the channel's audience grew quickly, its appeal cutting across age and ethnic lines. Part of the growth also was due to fees DCI paid cable companies to add Animal Planet to their lineups. DCI simultaneously announced the creation of four digital broadcast channels, which were available to only a limited number of viewers. The channels, Discovery Home & Leisure, Discovery Kids, Discovery Science, and Discovery Civilization, were expected to become more widely seen when digital broadcasting took hold as a popular medium. In the meantime the new channels, produced with smaller budgets than the company's primary ones, served as useful trial balloons to test the viability of new concepts.
In September 1997 Discovery announced that it would buy 70 percent of the Travel Channel from Paxson Communications for $20 million. The Travel Channel had 20.8 million subscribers and presented a mix of travel tips and vacation site profiles. Discovery soon began providing programming and logistical support for the channel. Later, in February 1999, DCI purchased the remaining 30 percent of the operation.
The company's flagship store opened in February 1998, six months late and $10 million over budget. The now 30,000-square-foot store featured a television studio, an 82-seat theater, a T-Rex skeleton, and the nose of a World War II era B-25 bomber that customers could climb into. Products offered for sale ranged from DCI's full line of videos to games, telescopes, fossils, and even an ice-age bear skeleton priced at $75,000.
During early 1998 DCI also attempted to purchase the low-rated Court TV cable channel from its owners, a consortium led by Time Warner. The $350 million deal was nixed by Time Warner shareholder and Vice-Chairman Ted Turner, however, reportedly because he feared DCI might convert Court TV into a concept that would compete with one of his own channels. In December DCI completed another acquisition attempt and bought CBS's struggling Eye on People channel, after initially planning to purchase only 50 percent of it. Eye on People (later changed to Discovery People) had only 11 million subscribers and was losing money for its parent company. DCI planned to continue to air the channel's mix of celebrity news and profiles, which included some content provided by CBS. During the year DCI also added two channels to its digital broadcasting lineup, Discovery Wings and the Discovery Health Channel. A Spanish-language digital channel was being offered by this time as well.

Entering the Field of Health in the Late 1990s

At year's end DCI formed a new subsidiary, Discovery Health Media, Inc., a multimedia venture that was intended to make the company a leader in the field of health and medical information. More than $300 million was allocated for the start-up, which was to include a web site that offered health news and information. The following summer digital channel Discovery Health was upgraded to regular cable status as part of the initiative.
The late 1990s also saw DCI lay plans to move its operations from Bethesda to Silver Spring, Maryland, by 2003. The company would occupy three buildings, two of which were to be newly constructed. Several other high-profile organizations soon followed suit and prepared to move to the once blighted Silver Spring. One was the American Film Institute, which would open a facility there and also co-produce a documentary film festival with DCI.
In November 1999 the company shut down its themed entertainment unit as a cost-cutting measure. The closing would mean the end of Discovery Channel Pictures, which had made Imax films including Africa's Elephant Kingdom, as well as the "Eco Challenge" made-for-TV sports event. At the same time DCI invested in Petstore.com, an online pet supply and information site that was expected to be used to cross-promote Animal Planet. DCI subsequently reshuffled its online operations and placed its web companies in a new subsidiary, Discovery.com, Inc., which was reportedly on the verge of being spun off to investors. DCI head John Hendricks also announced that he was helping to launch a new women's soccer league, which would field eight newly formed teams in 2001.
The summer of 2000 saw Discovery.com's IPO plans shelved, with $500 million in new financing sought through private investors. The move followed a downturn in investor confidence in the potential of the Web as a profit-making entity. In November the company laid off 40 percent of Discovery.com's staff, as profitability for the venture appeared more and more elusive. DCI's web site was redesigned to focus on the core television properties, with news stories and other original content reduced. Later in the year DCI also scaled back its plans for the Silver Spring facilities, canceling construction of one of the new buildings. The company had by this time quietly abandoned its Eye on People and Your Choice TV ventures, as well.
In early 2001 a potential challenge to DCI's dominance of the cable documentary market was launched by the National Geographic Society with the backing of Fox Cable Networks. DCI's Hendricks dismissed the start-up as too little, too late, noting that it would cost at least $250 million to get a comparable subscriber base to meet Discovery on its own turf. An Equitrend consumer survey recently had ranked Discovery as the number one most trusted brand name, eclipsing National Geographic's hold on the top spot. National Geographic went on the air with ten million subscribers, with plans over the next several years to reach 28 million—a figure still far below Discovery Channel's 81.2 million, The Learning Channel's 77.3 million, or Animal Planet's 66.9 million. Meanwhile, Discovery specials Raising the Mammoth and Walking with Dinosaurs set back-to-back records for cable documentaries with 10.1 million and 10.7 million viewers, respectively.
Nearing its 20th year in business, Discovery Communications, Inc. had assembled a formidable multimedia empire that was still growing. Firmly established on cable television, the company's well-regarded brand name was helping drive its moves into digital cable, cyberspace, and retail sales. Although not yet profitable, these operations positioned DCI well for future developments in the rapidly evolving media world of the 21st century.

Divisions[edit]
DCI operates its businesses in the following groups: Discovery Networks U.S., Discovery Networks International, Discovery Studios Group, Discovery Digital Media, and Discovery Education.[26]
Discovery Networks U.S.[edit]
The company's namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985.[27][28] In 1991, Discovery Channel's owners acquired The Learning Channel.[29]
In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel.[30][31][32] Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS's stake, leading to its January 1999 re-launch as Discovery People.[33][34] The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.[35]
On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV.[36] In 2002, Discovery re-launched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with The New York Times.[37] In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery's 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater.[38] In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned.[39] Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009.[40] In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and ecological living.[41]
On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to re-launch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009.[42] In 2008, Discovery Times was re-launched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries.[43] On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to re-launch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel.[44][45] The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010.[46][47] After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.[48][49]
On October 4, 2011, due to the wider rollout of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was replaced by Velocity, a new "upscale male"-oriented channel focusing primarily on automotive-themed programming.[50][51][52] On May 28, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept by 2010 due to poor viewership)[41] was re-launched as Destination America.[53] In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in The Hub (then Hub Network) from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family.[54][55] In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications' cable networks.[56]

After acquiring The Learning Channel (now TLC) in May 1991, Discovery announced plans in November 1994 to launch four new channels, including Animal Planet and what would later become Science Channel.[74]
In June 2002, Discovery Communications launched the first 24-7 HD network in the United States, Discovery HD Theater. HD feeds would later be launched for its networks in the U.S. and globally as the technology took hold in living rooms.
On March 17, 2009, Discovery revealed that it owned the rights to several patents related to e-books, in announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon.com, maker of the Kindle e-book reading device. The patents were originally developed by the company's founder John Hendricks; the specific patent in question in the suit was applied for in 1999 but issued in late 2007.[75][76]
On December 21, 2012, Discovery announced it had taken a 20% minority interest share with TF1 Group in sports broadcaster Eurosport, valued at €170 million (US$221.6 million).[77] On January 21, 2014, Discovery became the majority shareholder in Eurosport, taking a 51% share of the company.[78] In 2015, Discovery closed a transaction to acquire 100% of Eurosport.[79]
In April 2014, Discovery announced another digital investment in the form of a partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to launch digital studio, New Form Digital.
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.
In August 2015, Discovery Communications launched Discovery VR, a cross-company virtual reality offering, after announcing its plans in May
In December 2015, Discovery launched the company's first U.S. TVE streaming service, Discovery GO, connecting viewers with live and on-demand access to shows and series from several U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel and Discovery Life.
In Q2 2016, Discovery shifted its strategy entirely towards digital media, international markets, and diversifying content. In order to make up for shrinking cable network viewers, they have invested in direct-to-consumer offerings and digital distribution channels. 50% of their revenue was through affiliates this quarter. They took a minority stake in Chinese MCN VS Media, a company that has 55 million subscribers in China with more than 320 monthly video views.[80][81][82]
October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery’s digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake.[83][3]
2010 hostage crisis[edit]
On September 1, 2010, the DCI headquarters was the site of a hostage taking, a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee, armed with two starter pistols[84] and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building. Lee's motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.[85]
The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby.[86][87] The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people[88] hostage in the lobby.[86][89] The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated.[89] Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald's restaurant on Colesville Rd.[86] Lee was shot dead by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape.[90] The remaining hostages were immediately freed.[91] The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.[92]
James Jay Lee (c. 1967 – September 1, 2010) was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com,[87] among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of "parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions".[93] His manifesto also railed against "immigration pollution and anchor baby filth", leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an "eco-fascist".[94] Lee's opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis,[95] though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn's novel My Ishmael to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.[96] The Washington Post credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.[97]

Prior to September 18, 2008, DCI's ownership consisted of three shareholders:

Discovery Holding Company
Advance/Newhouse Communications which is owned with Advance Publications
John S. Hendricks, the company's Founder.

On September 17, 2008, Discovery Holding Company completed a restructuring plan. Discovery Holding's Ascent Media business was spun off, and the remaining businesses, Discovery Communications, LLC and Advance/Newhouse Communications, were combined into a new holding company, Discovery Communications, Inc.[17] The new fully public company and trades on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbols DISCA, DISCB, and DISCK. SEC filings are submitted by the Discovery Holding Company.[18]
In May 2014, the company announced a special dividend of shares of the Company's Series C common stock payable to holders of record of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock as of the close of business on July 28, 2014. As a result of the dividend, each holder of a share of the Company's Series A common stock, Series B common stock or Series C common stock will receive one additional share of the Company's Series C common stock on or about August 6, 2014.[19]
Through Group Nine Media, Discovery connects with millennial audiences through digital-first brands NowThis, Thrillist, The Dodo, Source Fed Studios and Seeker, which has 3.5 billion streams per month.[20][21]
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.[22]
Liberty Global and Discovery Communications paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[23][24][25]
Divisions[edit]
DCI operates its businesses in the following groups: Discovery Networks U.S., Discovery Networks International, Discovery Studios Group, Discovery Digital Media, and Discovery Education.[26]
Discovery Networks U.S.[edit]
The company's namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985.[27][28] In 1991, Discovery Channel's owners acquired The Learning Channel.[29]
In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel.[30][31][32] Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS's stake, leading to its January 1999 re-launch as Discovery People.[33][34] The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.[35]
On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV.[36] In 2002, Discovery re-launched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with The New York Times.[37] In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery's 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater.[38] In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned.[39] Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009.[40] In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and ecological living.[41]
On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions to re-launch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009.[42] In 2008, Discovery Times was re-launched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries.[43] On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to re-launch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel.[44][45] The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010.[46][47] After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.[48][49]
On October 4, 2011, due to the wider rollout of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was replaced by Velocity, a new "upscale male"-oriented channel focusing primarily on automotive-themed programming.[50][51][52] On May 28, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept by 2010 due to poor viewership)[41] was re-launched as Destination America.[53] In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in The Hub (then Hub Network) from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family.[54][55] In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications' cable networks.[56]

Group Nine Media[edit]
Main article: Group Nine Media
In October 2016, Discovery announced a minority investment in and strategic partnership with Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, and Discovery’s digital network Seeker and Sourcefed Studios, creating a digital-first media company in U.S. with 3.5 billion monthly video views.
Discovery Education[edit]
Discovery Education is a division which offers "standards-based digital content for K-12" In 2013, Discovery Education expanded its reach by acquiring Espresso Group Ltd.[72] Serving 3 million educators and over 30 million students, Discovery Education's services are in half of U.S. classrooms, over 40 percent of all primary schools in the UK, and more than 50 countries.[73]
History[edit]
After acquiring The Learning Channel (now TLC) in May 1991, Discovery announced plans in November 1994 to launch four new channels, including Animal Planet and what would later become Science Channel.[74]
In June 2002, Discovery Communications launched the first 24-7 HD network in the United States, Discovery HD Theater. HD feeds would later be launched for its networks in the U.S. and globally as the technology took hold in living rooms.
On March 17, 2009, Discovery revealed that it owned the rights to several patents related to e-books, in announcing a patent infringement lawsuit against Amazon.com, maker of the Kindle e-book reading device. The patents were originally developed by the company's founder John Hendricks; the specific patent in question in the suit was applied for in 1999 but issued in late 2007.[75][76]
On December 21, 2012, Discovery announced it had taken a 20% minority interest share with TF1 Group in sports broadcaster Eurosport, valued at €170 million (US$221.6 million).[77] On January 21, 2014, Discovery became the majority shareholder in Eurosport, taking a 51% share of the company.[78] In 2015, Discovery closed a transaction to acquire 100% of Eurosport.[79]
In April 2014, Discovery announced another digital investment in the form of a partnership with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard to launch digital studio, New Form Digital.
In May 2014, Discovery and Liberty Global announced an agreement to form a 50:50 joint venture to acquire All3Media, a producer and distributor of TV programming.
In August 2015, Discovery Communications launched Discovery VR, a cross-company virtual reality offering, after announcing its plans in May
In December 2015, Discovery launched the company's first U.S. TVE streaming service, Discovery GO, connecting viewers with live and on-demand access to shows and series from several U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio – Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, Velocity, Destination America, American Heroes Channel and Discovery Life.
In Q2 2016, Discovery shifted its strategy entirely towards digital media, international markets, and diversifying content. In order to make up for shrinking cable network viewers, they have invested in direct-to-consumer offerings and digital distribution channels. 50% of their revenue was through affiliates this quarter. They took a minority stake in Chinese MCN VS Media, a company that has 55 million subscribers in China with more than 320 monthly video views.[80][81][82]
October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media – a new media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis Media, The Dodo and Discovery’s digital network Seeker- for $100 million. Discovery will have the option in two years time to acquire a controlling stake.[83][3]
2010 hostage crisis[edit]
On September 1, 2010, the DCI headquarters was the site of a hostage taking, a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee, armed with two starter pistols[84] and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building. Lee's motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.[85]
The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when 43-year-old James Jay Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby.[86][87] The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people[88] hostage in the lobby.[86][89] The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated.[89] Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald's restaurant on Colesville Rd.[86] Lee was shot dead by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape.[90] The remaining hostages were immediately freed.[91] The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.[92]
James Jay Lee (c. 1967 – September 1, 2010) was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com,[87] among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of "parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions".[93] His manifesto also railed against "immigration pollution and anchor baby filth", leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an "eco-fascist".[94] Lee's opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis,[95] though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn's novel My Ishmael to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary An Inconvenient Truth.[96] The Washington Post credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.[97]

The Science Channel
Product Announcement from Discovery Communications, Inc.











The Science Channel is the ultimate source for entertaining specials and up-to-the-minute science news. In 37 million homes, The Science Channel takes viewers down to the molten core beneath the Earth's surface and to the outer edges of the solar system to explain how the universe works. The network also continues to be the source for up-to-the-minute space programming, with live coverage of the space shuttle's return to space and an exclusive and emotional documentary of Columbia's tragic final mission based on footage shot by one of its lost astronauts. 
The Science Channel remains a major source for science-related television programming through ongoing partnerships with some of the world's leading scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Scientific American, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These special partnerships give the network exclusive access to some of the most intriguing scientific stories of the day.
