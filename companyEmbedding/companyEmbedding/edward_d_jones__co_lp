History[edit]
Edward Jones was founded by Edward D. Jones in St. Louis, Missouri in 1922.[1] (A different Edward D. Jones was a cofounder of Dow Jones.[6]) Edward Jones' son Edward D. "Ted" Jones was responsible for the creation of the individual branch network which has spread across rural communities and suburbs throughout the US and Canada. The first single broker office was opened by Ted, and staffed by Zeke McIntyre, in Mexico, Missouri. Ted opened another branch office in Pueblo, Colorado, with his brother-in-law Bill Lloyd as manager of the multi-broker office. When Edward D. Jones Sr., found the teletypewriter line bill, he insisted Ted either shut the office down or find some way to pay for it. Ted Jones paid for it by opening one-broker offices on either side of the teletypewriter line stretching from St. Louis, Missouri, to Pueblo, Colorado. That is why some of the earliest Edward Jones offices were Dodge City, Hays, Great Bend, and Manhattan, Kansas and Jefferson City, Missouri.
Edward Jones Investments had the naming rights for the Edward Jones Dome in Saint Louis, Missouri. After the St. Louis Rams decided to move to Los Angeles, Edward Jones Investments exercised its right to terminate its sponsorship, and that the facility would once again be known as The Dome at America's Center.[7]
Business model[edit]
Edward Jones financial advisors offer commission-based and fee-based financial products. Offices are usually staffed by two associates: one Financial Advisor (see Financial Advisor, a licensed broker) and one Branch Office Administrator. The one-broker-per-office model allows clients to choose their broker directly and deal with just that broker. This model also allows the firm to open offices in areas and towns where a large office staffed by many brokers would be unprofitable. This model is also the reason[citation needed] that Edward Jones currently has the largest number of branch offices among brokerage firms in the United States.
Corporate affairs[edit]
The company has its corporate headquarters in the City of Des Peres in St. Louis County, Missouri.[8][9][10] Adjacent to the company headquarters is the Edward Jones South Campus, located at the intersection of Ballas Road and Manchester Road.[11] The Edward Jones North Campus is in an area southeast of the intersection of Interstate 270 and Dorsett Road in the City of Maryland Heights in St. Louis County.[12]
Edward Jones has locations in the United States and Canada. The company had offices in the United Kingdom for 10 years, before selling the division to Towry Law in 2009.[13]
Awards and rankings[edit]

Designated the firm with "Highest in Investor Satisfaction" by J. D. Power and Associates in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013.
In Canada also Designated the firm with "Highest in Investor Satisfaction" by J. D. Power and Associates in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Edward Jones ranked No. 1 in the annual SmartMoney magazine full-service brokerage survey. The firm received high marks in the four categories surveyed by the magazine: stock picking, customer satisfaction, trust and customer statements.
Named one of the "Best Companies to Work for in America" by Fortune magazine in its annual listing. The firm took the No. 5 spot overall in the ranking (2017).[14]

Criticism and controversy[edit]
Revenue sharing[edit]
On Dec. 22, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD and the New York Stock Exchange settled enforcement proceedings against Edward Jones, related to allegations that Edward Jones failed to adequately disclose revenue sharing payments that it received from a select group of mutual fund families that Edward Jones recommended to its customers.[15][16]
As part of the settlement, Edward Jones paid a $75 million fine. Edward Jones also agreed to disclose on its public website information regarding revenue sharing payments including the admission that "Edward Jones’ receipt of revenue sharing payments creates a potential conflict of interest in the form of an additional financial incentive and financial benefit to the firm, its financial advisors and equity owners in connection with the sale of products from these product partners."[17]
Municipal Bonds overcharging[edit]
On Aug. 13, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission required Edward Jones to pay a $20 million fine because, according to the SEC: "Edward Jones undermined the integrity of the bond underwriting process by overcharging retail customers by at least $4.6 million and by misleading municipal issuers."[18]

Edward Jones was founded by Edward D. Jones in St. Louis, Missouri in 1922.[1] (A different Edward D. Jones was a cofounder of Dow Jones.[6]) Edward Jones' son Edward D. "Ted" Jones was responsible for the creation of the individual branch network which has spread across rural communities and suburbs throughout the US and Canada. The first single broker office was opened by Ted, and staffed by Zeke McIntyre, in Mexico, Missouri. Ted opened another branch office in Pueblo, Colorado, with his brother-in-law Bill Lloyd as manager of the multi-broker office. When Edward D. Jones Sr., found the teletypewriter line bill, he insisted Ted either shut the office down or find some way to pay for it. Ted Jones paid for it by opening one-broker offices on either side of the teletypewriter line stretching from St. Louis, Missouri, to Pueblo, Colorado. That is why some of the earliest Edward Jones offices were Dodge City, Hays, Great Bend, and Manhattan, Kansas and Jefferson City, Missouri.
Edward Jones Investments had the naming rights for the Edward Jones Dome in Saint Louis, Missouri. After the St. Louis Rams decided to move to Los Angeles, Edward Jones Investments exercised its right to terminate its sponsorship, and that the facility would once again be known as The Dome at America's Center.[7]
Business model[edit]
Edward Jones financial advisors offer commission-based and fee-based financial products. Offices are usually staffed by two associates: one Financial Advisor (see Financial Advisor, a licensed broker) and one Branch Office Administrator. The one-broker-per-office model allows clients to choose their broker directly and deal with just that broker. This model also allows the firm to open offices in areas and towns where a large office staffed by many brokers would be unprofitable. This model is also the reason[citation needed] that Edward Jones currently has the largest number of branch offices among brokerage firms in the United States.
Corporate affairs[edit]
The company has its corporate headquarters in the City of Des Peres in St. Louis County, Missouri.[8][9][10] Adjacent to the company headquarters is the Edward Jones South Campus, located at the intersection of Ballas Road and Manchester Road.[11] The Edward Jones North Campus is in an area southeast of the intersection of Interstate 270 and Dorsett Road in the City of Maryland Heights in St. Louis County.[12]
Edward Jones has locations in the United States and Canada. The company had offices in the United Kingdom for 10 years, before selling the division to Towry Law in 2009.[13]
Awards and rankings[edit]

Designated the firm with "Highest in Investor Satisfaction" by J. D. Power and Associates in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013.
In Canada also Designated the firm with "Highest in Investor Satisfaction" by J. D. Power and Associates in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Edward Jones ranked No. 1 in the annual SmartMoney magazine full-service brokerage survey. The firm received high marks in the four categories surveyed by the magazine: stock picking, customer satisfaction, trust and customer statements.
Named one of the "Best Companies to Work for in America" by Fortune magazine in its annual listing. The firm took the No. 5 spot overall in the ranking (2017).[14]

Criticism and controversy[edit]
Revenue sharing[edit]
On Dec. 22, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD and the New York Stock Exchange settled enforcement proceedings against Edward Jones, related to allegations that Edward Jones failed to adequately disclose revenue sharing payments that it received from a select group of mutual fund families that Edward Jones recommended to its customers.[15][16]
As part of the settlement, Edward Jones paid a $75 million fine. Edward Jones also agreed to disclose on its public website information regarding revenue sharing payments including the admission that "Edward Jones’ receipt of revenue sharing payments creates a potential conflict of interest in the form of an additional financial incentive and financial benefit to the firm, its financial advisors and equity owners in connection with the sale of products from these product partners."[17]
Municipal Bonds overcharging[edit]
On Aug. 13, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission required Edward Jones to pay a $20 million fine because, according to the SEC: "Edward Jones undermined the integrity of the bond underwriting process by overcharging retail customers by at least $4.6 million and by misleading municipal issuers."[18]

Online Access Security





Secure Logon

The confidentiality of your financial information is important to us, and we're committed to keeping it secure.
We keep your information safe through Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. TLS scrambles the information you enter, such as your user ID and password, before it leaves your computer. This ensures that no one else can read your information as it travels across the Internet from your computer to ours.
After you log in to Edward Jones Online Account Access, look for:

The small, locked padlock on your web browser (most likely near the address bar). This indicates TLS technology is used.
"https://" at the beginning of the website address, or URL. The "s" means you're on a secure site.


"Auto Complete" Disabled

Many browsers offer an "auto complete" feature. With auto complete, you have the option to save your user ID and password information on your computer. The next time you visit the site, this information automatically fills in as you type the first few letters.
For added security, we do not support auto complete on our account access login page. This means you must enter your complete user ID and password each time you log in. We're sorry for any inconvenience; however, we want to ensure your information is as secure as possible.

Online Access Security





Secure Logon

The confidentiality of your financial information is important to us, and we're committed to keeping it secure.
We keep your information safe through Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology. TLS scrambles the information you enter, such as your user ID and password, before it leaves your computer. This ensures that no one else can read your information as it travels across the Internet from your computer to ours.
After you log in to Edward Jones Online Account Access, look for:

The small, locked padlock on your web browser (most likely near the address bar). This indicates TLS technology is used.
"https://" at the beginning of the website address, or URL. The "s" means you're on a secure site.


"Auto Complete" Disabled

Many browsers offer an "auto complete" feature. With auto complete, you have the option to save your user ID and password information on your computer. The next time you visit the site, this information automatically fills in as you type the first few letters.
For added security, we do not support auto complete on our account access login page. This means you must enter your complete user ID and password each time you log in. We're sorry for any inconvenience; however, we want to ensure your information is as secure as possible.
