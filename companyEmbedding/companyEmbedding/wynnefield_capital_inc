Strategy | Wynnefield Capital | Financial Services







Fund Strategies
 Our investment objective is to identify opportunities in small capitalization value U.S. stocks. We perform substantial original research both on specific companies and the industries in which they operate. While we may selectively short individual stocks and indexes, our basic strategy is equity ownership in undervalued small-cap companies. We apply generally accepted valuation metrics to both balance sheets and income statements. We seek to identify industry or company catalysts which will change the perceived value of a business. 
Catalytic factors we consider include: 


A balance sheet with little or rapidly decreasing debt.  
Changes in governmental regulation.  
Scale driven industry consolidation.  
Management succession issues or situations where management compensation is related directly to creation of shareholder value.  
Shareholder friendly governance posture.  
Tracking insider transaction filings.  
Turnaround situations where changes in the structure of a business or industry improve opportunities for realization of embedded shareholder value. 


Wynnefield maintains a pro-active posture with respect to its portfolio names when it believes management is not taking appropriate measures to surface shareholder value, where corporate governance issues exist, or where outside assistance can be provided to a management working to implement value creating strategies. In numerous cases, we are Schedule 13-D and Form 4 filers. Wynnefield does not generally seek out Board representation. However, one of our members will occasionally, where the size of the position and potential return warrants a higher level of resource commitment, accept a board of director's seat. We are not litigious and do not accept greenmail, operating only for the entire class of holders of which we are part.
WCI seeks to provide hedged returns, not only through individual securities, but through the use of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) when our research indicates systemic market or sector risk. Indications we look for include overextended valuations relative to earnings potential, increasing balance sheet risk, unfavorable marketplace changes for a company's products, management instability, extreme speculative market moves, or the emergence of deteriorating industry macros. 
Wynnefield employs tax effective trading strategies, focused on achievement of long term capital gains.

Wynnefield Capital, Inc. (WCI) is a value investor, specializing in U.S. small cap situations that have a company or industry specific catalyst(s). Surfacing of these catalysts unlocks existing, but previously unrecognized value for shareholders. WCI maintains an active investment philosophy. We are not involved in "Greenmail" situations, but focus on initiatives with management and outside directors to release value. 
We seek out under-followed, unrecognized and undervalued companies that fit our parameters which include minimal balance sheet risk and potential for micro or macro change. WCI adds value by uncovering both long and short opportunities through in-depth original research. The investment manager holds core positions about 6-8 years, turning the portfolio approximately 25% per year, providing its limited partners the benefit of tax efficient returns.
WCI was established in 1992. Our founding partners, Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes, held senior research and institutional equity positions at Lazard Freres & Co. Among the initial Wynnefield investors were Nelson's and Joshua's colleagues at Lazard.

Wynnefield Seeks Options For Omega Protein
Jun 8 16
Wynnefield Capital, Inc. considers multiple strategic alternatives for Omega Protein Corporation (NYSE:OME). Omega Protein Corporation in a letter to its shareholders has said that Wynnefield is attempting to place a director on the Omega board that Omega feels has no relevant industry or financial experience, as well as consideration of strategic alternatives that include a sale of the company.


Wynnefield Requests Omega To Exit Human Nutrition Business
Mar 11 16
Wynnefield Capital, Inc. called on Omega Protein Corporation (NYSE:OME) to exit the human nutrition business and redeploy proceeds into its profitable core business. Wynnefield, said the company's venture into the human nutrition business "has been a wasteful squandering of almost eight dollars a share of shareholder free cash flow and a textbook case of 'diworsification.'" Wynnefield added it is highly skeptical that the company's "seemingly endless review of strategic alternatives will reach this conclusion."

Industry
Hedge funds


Founded
1992


Founder
Nelson Obus, Joshua Landes


Headquarters
New York, NY


Website
WynnefieldCapital.com


Wynnefield Capital, Inc., is an employee-owned hedge fund founded in 1992 by Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes. The fund is a value investor, specializing in U.S. small-cap companies with a business- or industry-specific catalyst. It employs long and short strategies and conducts in-house research in making its investments.[1][2] The fund has been an activist investor[3] with a number of companies, including Cornell Companies,[4] Crown Crafts,[5] Breeze-Eastern,[6] MAM Software,[7] Chiquita Brands,[8] and Omega Protein.[9]
Wynnefield Capital is based in New York City and is named after Nelson Obus’ and Landes’ childhood neighborhood of Wynnefield in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[3]
In May 2014, after a 12-year battle, Nelson Obus and a Wynnefield analyst were exonerated of all insider trading accusations made by the SEC in a trial by jury.[10][11][12][13][14] Nelson Obus has been an outspoken critic of the SEC[15] and penned an op-ed on regulatory overreach for The Wall Street Journal.[16]
Founders: Nelson Obus and Joshua Landes[edit]
Prior to founding Wynnefield, Nelson Obus and Landes both held senior research equity positions at Lazard Feres & Co.[2] Nelson Obus currently serves on the Board of Directors for Zionist Organization of America,[17] Layne Christensen Co.,[18] MK Acquisition LLC, and the Princeton Historical Society.[19] Obus also serves on the Board of Advisors of the Bank of Princeton,[20] the Appalachian Mountain Club,[21] and the Stony Brook-Millstone Watershed Association.[22] He previously served on the Boards of Directors of Breeze-Eastern Corporation and Underground Solutions, Inc.[2]
Landes is a member of the Board of Trustees of S.A.R. Academy in Riverdale, New York;[23] Board of Directors of Ken's Krew[24] and the Zionist Organization of America,[17] and the Vice President of the American Jewish Historical Society.[25] Landes led the financing efforts for the creation of a statue commemorating Uriah P. Levy, the first Jewish admiral to serve in the U.S. Navy.[26]
