3 Important Waste Management Services That Help Protect Our Environment
Waste management specialists are always looking for ways to enhance their eco-friendliness, and the best companies will offer a wide array of services to ensure that all waste is properly disposed. These waste management services are particularly important for C&D operations, and without these specialists, the large buildings we live and work in would not be possible.Through a combination of landfill services, recycling initiatives, and ancillary services like roll off container rental, the best waste management services take a comprehensive approach to solid waste disposal. The U.S. produced over 250 million tons of municipal solid waste per year over the last decade, and the Earth would be in a far worse place if it weren't for eco-conscious waste management services. Here are three of the most important solid waste services that are building a better tomorrow for future generations:* Landfill services. Construction and demolition jobs produce a hefty amount of debris, and it all needs a place to go once the task is complete. Landfill services provide C&D companies with just that, and separating this waste from other solid waste is a major step in protecting the environment. From asphalt/rock to lumber/wood, glass, and metal, these waste management services can transport debris to the appropriate landfill and make your job much easier.* Recycling. Despite being readily available to most Americans, the lack of focus on recycling in the U.S. is truly disturbing. The EPA estimates that 75% of the American waste stream is recyclable, yet we only recycle about 30% of it. The best waste management services comb through their loads to ensure that no reusable goods are being put into landfills. Once we begin to emphasize recycling, the environment will improve by leaps and bounds, and we can reap the benefits. In fact, recycling just one aluminum can save enough energy to listen to a full album on your iPod, and recycling 100 cans could light your bedroom for two whole weeks.* Roll off container rental. When performing jobs like remodeling a home or demolishing a building, you will produce a large amount of debris that cannot be placed in normal landfills. Waste management services can provide you with both a roll off container to store this debris as well as an appropriate landfill to dispose of it. Sometimes, people in these situations get lazy and throw debris in the trash, which is one of the reasons that our environment continues to decline in quality.Improving our solid waste disposal habits is the path to a healthier future, and that's exactly what the best waste management services are striving to achieve. Invest in an eco-friendly waste management service and, more importantly, invest in tomorrow.    Here's How a Eco-Friendly Waste Management Service Can Enhance Your Production    Municipal and industrial entities produce large amounts of waste every single day, and this waste can have a dramatic impact on the environment if it isn't being properly disposed. Solid waste disposal is not something to cut corners on, and you need waste management solutions that can both make your job easier as well as protect the environment.There is over 250 million tons of municipal solid waste produced annually in the U.S., and much of this waste comes in the form of debris from construction and demolition (C&D.) It is absolutely crucial to dispose of C&D waste in an eco-friendly manner, and the best waste management services will inspect all loads to ensure that no recyclable material is being put into landfills.Landfill services enable municipal entities to focus on the job at hand while their waste is being taken care of in a safe and effective way. Recycling is a primary benefit of these services, and while over 87% of Americans have access to curbside paper recycling programs, C&D operations are usually not given this luxury. The best waste management services focus on recycling initiatives that help the environment, and these benefits extend to the companies that obtain them.For example, reclaimed and recycled wood from landfills is ideal for mulch production. While reusing these materials for mulch helps the environment, it also beautifies the homes and gardens of those who use the finished product. Waste management initiatives like this are helping the entire country to ramp up its recycling efforts, including helping the state of Florida meet its mandate for 75% recycling by 2020.Waste management services also offer a host of other important waste disposal benefits, such as roll off container rental. C&D jobs result in tons of waste being left behind on job sites, and without these roll off containers, this debris could not be disposed of in the proper landfills.Take the time to find a quality waste management option in your area that can provide all of these crucial services. By taking advantage of these services, you'll streamline onsite production and continue the growing effort to better protect our environment.

How to Handle Waste Management While Being Environmentally Friendly
There have been large changes made within the garbage management industry in recent years. A large part of this is due to the increase in pollution caused by waste. Between the growing population and a lack of recycling, waste is at an all-time high. However, there are more and more resources available to help with waste management. When contemplating how to handle your waste, remember this: * The average person creates more than four pounds of waste every day. * We only recycle 30% of our waste. About 75% of it is recyclable. * America produced more than 250 million tons of trash in 2013. Aside from recycling centers, there are plenty of businesses making the transition to being "green." Many waste disposal companies offer a wide range of services. This includes recycling, roll off container rental, and mulch services. As waste management specialists, they are a great resource for any large solid waste disposal needs or questions you may have. When you find yourself in a situation involving a lot of potential waste, don't hesitate to call your local garbage management company to ask questions. For example, a lot of people find themselves with a lot of waste when they move to a new residence. While this is only natural after the accumulation of odds and ends over the years, not all of it should go to the landfill. A great way to handle situations like these is to find a clean space to lay out the things you are contemplating throwing away. With a roll off container nearby, take a moment to observe how much waste you are potentially sending to a landfill, unable to decompose. You can decrease your waste by carefully finding items that can be recycled in any way. This includes clothes that can be donated or passed down. This is a great opportunity to get your local garbage management company involved. They can help you differentiate between recyclables and waste. They can handle both so they're a great source for information regarding recycling and waste.

Reduce and Reuse: The Future of Waste Management Services
We've all heard about the extensive benefits of recycling. With the help of your local waste management services company, you can extend the reach of your recycling efforts. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that Americans recycle only 30% of our recyclable waste stream. Considering the fact that the average person creates 1.5 tons of solid waste each year while the country as a whole produces 250 million tons, there is much more we can do. Reduce: "Reduce, reuse, recycle" is the popular catch-phrase of the environmentally-friendly. It's a simple premise but contains logistics that most don't consider. By the time you're ready to recycle something, there are already many environmentally-conscious decisions that have been missed. While most have been educated on the recycling part, it all starts with reducing the amount of potential waste you produce and consume. By shifting your focus to products that are well-designed and produce minimal waste, you're being proactive about solid waste disposal rather than reactive. Reuse:If you have materials that are potential waste, finding ways to reuse them helps to keep them out of a landfill. Even materials that are recyclable should be considered for multiple uses. If you find yourself with an old shoe box, put it aside until you find another use for it. Materials like cardboard boxes can be used for a multitude of things: crafts, toys for pets, storage, etc. Thinking twice before throwing something away will make a huge difference. Educate yourself: There are a vast multitude of materials that can be recycled and it's important for you to know which ones. Aside from that, knowing what your local waste management services company will and won't accept as recyclables is the first step. Once you've figured out what you can recycle, make a list of those materials and put it somewhere easily accessible. This will serve as an easy reference resource for members of the household. Hanging it above the garbage can will help stop recyclable waste from being thrown out. Do you have any handy garbage management tips and tricks? Sound off in the comments below!

Types of Commercial Waste Management Services
As a country, the United States is pretty high on the list of wasteful populations. With such a large number of businesses, commercial industries' lack of efficient waste management and solid waste disposal is especially concerning. In the last decade, we've produced more than 250 million tons of waste annually. That's enough garbage to fill Busch Stadium from top to bottom twice a day. Of that waste, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates only 30% of the recyclable waste was actually recycled. Residential access to drop-off paper recycling programs and other waste management services is at 87% and is steadily increasing. However, focus has shifted to helping commercial businesses with their recycling efforts. When it comes to garbage management within the business world, the initiative has to be taken to reduce waste by a large margin. The ideal for the future of waste management services lies in a zero-waste approach. While this may seem outlandish to some, it's important to note that up until a century ago, our population was zero-waste. Plastics weren't used to wrap food and materials like fabrics and paper were used repeatedly to save money and resources. But without the push of policy makers and the business elite, this goal becomes unlikely. To implement a new recycling and composting policy at the workplace, it's best to start by taking small steps. Make sure there are recycling bins placed throughout the office that are easily accessible. To make it easier for employees, place a sign above different recycling receptacles to discern what materials can be put in that specific one. Part of the issue may be getting people to take the initiative seriously. It's a good idea to implement a reward system for the amount of material recycled. This provides incentive for employees to follow the no-waste approach. Getting everyone on board with a zero-waste initiative will not only provide an eco-friendly workplace but it will also provide a bonding experience for employees. Do you have recycling tips and tricks that you use at work? Does your workplace recycle? Sound off in the comments below!

He successfully completed 60 acquisitions expanding the business into 15 counties in New York State. Ulster Sanitation was valued at over $70 million at the time it was sold off to leading solid waste providers such as Waste Management, United Waste, Eastern Environmental and Casella Waste Systems. Currently, Chairman, Mr. Teelon will draw on his past experience to assist management within the solid waste sector to expand the National Waste footprint in the southeast region.

He diversified to keep increasing revenue by trucking recycled materials to other various facilities saving airspace at the landfill while fulfilling the need for recycled materials. In 2014 Sandland became a subsidiary under public company under National Waste where he continues to hold the CEO position at National Waste.
