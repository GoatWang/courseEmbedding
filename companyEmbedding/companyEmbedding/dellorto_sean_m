Hilton Worldwide Announces CEO and CFO Appointments for Planned REIT | Business Wire
























































Hilton Worldwide Announces CEO and CFO Appointments for 
      Planned REIT




Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr. Will Serve as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer and Sean M. Dell’Orto as Chief Financial Officer






April 27, 2016 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hilton Worldwide (NYSE: HLT) today announced the appointment of Thomas 
      J. Baltimore, Jr. as president and chief executive officer and Sean M. 
      Dell’Orto as chief financial officer of the planned real estate 
      investment trust (REIT) that is expected to form following its 
      separation from Hilton Worldwide later this year.
    


      In February 2016, Hilton Worldwide announced 
      plans to spin-off its timeshare and real estate businesses, creating 
      three market-leading, independent public companies. Baltimore’s 
      appointment as CEO of the planned REIT is effective May 16. Baltimore 
      will report to Christopher J. Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton 
      Worldwide, and Dell’Orto will continue to serve as senior vice president 
      and treasurer for Hilton Worldwide.
    

      “The appointments of Tom and Sean represent a major step forward in the 
      execution of our REIT spin-off,” said Nassetta. “We are confident that 
      Tom’s extensive capital allocation experience and proven leadership make 
      him the perfect fit to oversee the long-term success of the REIT 
      business. Additionally, I have had the pleasure of working alongside 
      Sean for the past six years, and he is a first-rate addition to the 
      executive team.”
    

      Baltimore most recently served as president and CEO of RLJ Lodging Trust 
      (NYSE: RLJ), a publicly traded real estate investment trust that he 
      co-founded with Robert L. Johnson. He has led RLJ since its IPO in 2011 
      and its predecessor entities since 2000. RLJ currently owns 125 hotels 
      in major markets in North America, with more than 20,900 guest rooms and 
      a portfolio value in excess of $4 billion. Prior to RLJ, Baltimore was 
      with Hilton Hotels Corporation as vice president, development and 
      finance, and vice president, gaming development. He also served as vice 
      president, business development for Host Marriott Services, and he 
      worked for Marriott Corporation in various positions. Baltimore holds a 
      Master of Business Administration from the Darden Graduate School of 
      Business Administration and a Bachelor of Science in Commerce from the 
      McIntire School, both from the University of Virginia. He also serves as 
      a director of Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU) and Duke Realty (NYSE: 
      DRE).
    

      “I’m delighted and thrilled to lead what will be one of the largest and 
      most geographically diverse publically traded REITs, and I look forward 
      to working with Chris and his superb team at Hilton,” said Baltimore. 
      “We expect the high-quality portfolio, along with the deep expertise and 
      institutional insights from leaders like Sean, will enable our team to 
      unlock significant embedded growth and create long-term returns for 
      shareholders.”
    

      Dell’Orto serves as Hilton Worldwide’s senior vice president and 
      treasurer, and he has been integral in Hilton’s corporate strategy, 
      capital markets and investor relations activities, including the 
      company’s IPO, since joining the company in 2010. Previously, Dell’Orto 
      was senior vice president and chief financial officer of Barceló 
      Crestline Corporation, a private third-party management company and 
      hotel owner, and was vice president and treasurer at Highland 
      Hospitality Corporation, a publicly traded lodging REIT. Dell’Orto holds 
      a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School at the 
      University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Science in Commerce from 
      the McIntire School at the University of Virginia.
