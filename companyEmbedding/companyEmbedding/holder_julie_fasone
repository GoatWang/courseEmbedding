Julie Fasone Holder Receives Outstanding Alumni Award from The Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University


Midland - October 13, 2008
Julie Fasone Holder, Dow senior vice president, chief marketing, sales and reputation officer, has been presented with the Outstanding Alumni Award by The Eli Broad College of Business at Michigan State University.
Fasone Holder received the award in East Lansing, Mich., at a ceremony on October 4 during the university’s Homecoming Weekend. The award recognizes alumni who exemplify outstanding professional accomplishment, strong involvement with the university, excellent leadership qualities and commitment to community service.
In accepting her award, Fasone Holder thanked the many mentors during her college career, who set the foundation for lifelong professional and personal growth and recognized how MSU’s diversity of people and ideas contribute to its vitality.
“Like Dow, MSU has long been a place that excels at fostering the individual, honing the skills and talents that allow a person to achieve his or her personal best,” Fasone Holder said. “It is an environment characterized by diversity and inclusiveness, in recognition that learning is enhanced and a community is made stronger and more dynamic by nurturing a variety of viewpoints and contributions.”
“I congratulate Julie on this outstanding achievement,” said Dow’s Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris. “Her leadership contributions at Dow, as well as her commitment to the professional development of her colleagues and to her community, make her well deserving of this award. She truly exemplifies the power of the Human Element at work.”
In her 30-year career with Dow, Fasone Holder has held a variety of commercial and functional leadership positions across the United States with local, national and global responsibilities. She assumed her current position in January 2008. She is a member of the company’s Management Committee, serves on the Sustainability and People operational teams, and has executive oversight for Dow’s activities in the United States.
In 1999, Fasone Holder was awarded Dow’s prestigious GENESIS Award for people excellence. She also was named one of the Women Worth Watching in 2007 by the Profiles in Diversity Journal, and was honored by the National Association for Female Executives as a Woman of Achievement at their January 2007 national conference.
