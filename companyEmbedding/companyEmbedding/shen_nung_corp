A Timeline of Tea History 
We’ve explained before the semantics of the naming of Organo Gold’s Red Tea product. While in the West we generally refer to the color of the tea leaves, and thus call it “black tea” — in China, Korea and Japan, the name refers to the color of the infused drink itself. So, that’s why what some people in Western countries think of as “black tea” is dubbed “red tea” in the Organo Gold product family.
Tea is believed to have been discovered completely by accident, way back in 2737 BC. It is said that Shen Nung, the second emperor of China, discovered tea when some leaves from a Camellia sinensis plant (the plant that all traditional teas are made from) blew into his pot of boiling water. The habit of drinking tea leaves stepped in a tea pot didn’t become popular until during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
Here’s a timeline that traces the long and storied history of the beverage that is so popular today — from that first accidental leaf right through to the first tea bag.
2737 B.C.
According to legend, the second emperor of China, Shen Nung, discovers tea when tea leaves blow into his boiling water.
A.D. 350
A Chinese dictionary cites tea for the first time as Erh Ya.
400
Demand for tea as a medicinal drink rises in China, and it is begun to be cultivated and processed.
479
Turkish traders begin to trade for tea from Mongolia.
593
Japanese priests studying in China carry tea seeds and leaves back to Japan. It is rare and expensive and is consumed mostly by high priests and the aristocracy.
725
The Chinese give tea its own character, ch’a.
780
The first book of tea, titled Ch’a Ching (The Classic of Tea), is written. It discusses ancient tea cultivation and preparation techniques.
1280
After the Mongols take over China, tea loses its aristocratic status and becomes more popular among the masses.
1368-1644
After the fall of the Ming Dynasty with the Mongol takeover, all teas (black, green, and oolong) are easily accessible in China. Steeping whole tea leaves in cups or teapots becomes more popular.
1422-1502
Zen priest Murata Shuko creates the Japanese tea ceremony and calls it cha-no-yu (hot water tea). It celebrates the mundane aspects of everyday life. Tea becomes more than just an art form and almost a religion.
1589
Europeans are exposed to tea when a Venetian author claims that Asians live so long because of their tea consumption.
1597
Tea appears for the first time in an English translation of Dutch explorer Jan Hugo van Linschoten’s papers. He refers to tea as chaa.
1610
The Dutch bring back green tea from Japan (though some scholars say it was actually from China). The Dutch East India Company markets tea as a medicinal drink, though only the very rich can afford it.
1618
Chinese ambassadors present the Russian Czar Alexis with chests of tea. He refuses it as being useless.
1657
The first tea is sold in London, England, at Garraway’s Coffee House, as a health beverage.
1662
England’s King Charles II’s new bride, Catherine Braganza of Portugal, is an avid tea drinker and helps make tea more popular and accessible.
1690
The first tea is sold publicly in Massachusetts.
1717
Thomas Twining transforms Tom’s Coffee House into the “Golden Lyon, the first tea shop in England.
1773
In what is known as the Boston Tea Party, a group of Massachusetts colonists dumped several hundred chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest taxes on tea.
1840
Anna the Duchess of Bedford introduces afternoon tea.
1856
Tea is planted in and around Darjeeling, India.
1876

1904
Englishman Richard Blechynden invents iced tea during a heat wave at the St. Louis World’s Fair.
1908
New Yorker Thomas Sullivan invents tea bags when he sends tea to clients in small silk bags and they mistakenly steep the whole bag.

Shen Nung, The Divine Husbandman, And Hemp

 

Hemp has a long history dating back a known 6,000 years, and we are celebrating Hemp History Week 2016 by featuring Shen Nung, also known as the Divine Husbandman.
Shen Nung is considered by many scholars to be the father of Chinese agriculture, having taught the populace he ruled over as emperor how to cultivate grains as food, leading to the diversification of the food supply and a lower dependence on animal meats.
It is also said that he tasted and tested hundreds, if not thousands, of herbs and spices to test their medicinal value. It is also believed that he was the auther of the Pen Ts’ao ching (Materia Medica), one of the earliest incarnations of the Chinese pharmacopoeia. Contained within this text is information about 365 medicines derived from minerals, plants, and animals, including the wonderfully useful l. cannabis sativa.
What Does The Pen Ts’ao Ching Say?
According to antiquecannabisbook.com, the translation of this page is as follows:

Page referring to Hemp in the 1234 AD edition of the Pen Ts’ao ching.
Column 5 (right most column)
[1,2] Medical Cannabis [4,5] is spicy when eaten [7-8] but has poison [9-13] good for the five organs, to bring the bodies Yin Yang into balance.
Column 4
[1,2 ] Medical Cannabis [3,4] stop eating [4,5] let go [eat more] [9-12] you will see white ghosts [13] walking around [14-20] and eat long enough, you will know how to talk to the Gods.
Column 3
Plant has grown and is good on July 7th, when plant can be picked.
(Note: The hemp plant grows to maturity within 2 to 6 months, but usually in 4 months. Given the fact that planting season is probably (after winter) in February, this statement should actually translated as — The plant should be picked just at the right time of maturity).
Column 2
[1] Not a major drug, but it [2,3] tastes good [4] is not rough [5, 6,7] and is NOT poison [8] Can help many middle — Helps much your energy, your whole body — stops sweat (because of cold) and leaves the water from the body, urine
Column 1 (left most)
[1] Skin . . stomach . . . forever . . . women . . . with baby . . . long hair . . . can be . . . medicine . . time.
Shen-Nung is also credited with creating oils and salves from pressed hemp seed and stalks. He used these products of the hemp plant to treat skin irritation, inflammation, rheumatic pain, intestinal constipation, and disorders of the female reproductive system.
Hemp oil was even used by the Chinese as an ingredient in a popular immortality elixir. Though it didn’t create immortals, this application illustrates the faith that early societies had for the plant’s potential to provide answers to each of life’s challenging questions.
The historical importance of hemp has been demonstrated time and time again, and yet another resurgence has been made in the past few decades after years of unfounded prohibition based upon greed and prejudices of major corporate interests in the first third of the twentieth century. It is clear that the future of hemp is at stake, and we are here pushing the envelope to continue to bring to you the best and most effective hemp derived products for your optimum health.
