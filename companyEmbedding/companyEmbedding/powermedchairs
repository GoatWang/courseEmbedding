(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Information  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "will," "plan," "seeks," "intend," and "expect" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are reasonable, these plans, intentions, or expectations may not be achieved. Our actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, or implied, by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by federal securities laws, we are under no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Critical Accounting Policies  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in, "Management's Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations", included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  Results of Operations  Overview of Current Operations  PowerMedChairs was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 22, 2013, under the name PowerMedChairs. We consider ourselves to be an emerging growth company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. From our inception to date, we have generated no revenues, and our operations have been limited to organizational, start-up, and capital formation activities. Our plan of operation is to re-build wheelchairs in disrepair, market our services and sell wheelchairs.  On March 26, 2013, the company formed a subsidiary named PowerMedChairs Shareholder Acquisition Corporation. This subsidiary acquired the control block of 25,000,000 shares of Tropical PC, Inc. a dormant Nevada corporation for $10,000 cash. This control block represent 99.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of Tropical PC. After the 25,000,000 shares were acquired by PowerMedChairs, by a Board Resolution, they were cancelled. The remaining shareholders of Tropical PC, representing 210,000 shares exchanged their shares on a one-for-one basis for shares in the subsidiary. When the subsidiary collapsed into PowerMedChairs, each of the subsidiary's shareholders received a one-for-one share exchange of PowerMedChairs shares. These newly issued shares were issued in the reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by section 4(2) of the Act, on the basis that the transaction does not involve a public offering.  Our Business  PowerMedChairs plans to rebuild primarily electric/power wheelchairs in disrepair. Electric wheelchairs are for people who need support for their upper body and who are unable to move a manual chair with their arms and hands. A power chair has a more supportive seat and often a headrest for people who are not able to hold themselves upright. The electric wheelchair consists of a number of mechanical and electric components that need to be replaced every few year. In most cases, it is much more cost effective to repair a broken electric wheelchair than replace the entire unit.  Products and Services  A wheelchair is a chair with wheels, designed to be a replacement for walking. The device comes in variations where it is propelled by motors or by the seated occupant turning the rear wheels by hand. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness (physiological or physical), injury, or disability  Everyday manual wheelchairs come in two major designs-folding or rigid. The rigid chairs, which are increasingly preferred by active users, have permanently welded joints and many fewer moving parts. This reduces the energy required to push the chair by eliminating many points where the chair would flex as it moves. Welding the joints also reduces the overall weight of the chair. Rigid chairs typically feature instant-release rear wheels and backrests that fold down flat, allowing the user to dismantle the chair quickly for storage in a car.  The primary design of a rigid wheelchair is to fit the body of the user. The primary design of a folding wheelchair is to fold. Folding wheelchairs are generally boxy, while rigid wheelchairs conform to the shape of the body. For example, with a rigid chair, one can taper the design to conform to the body shape (large at the hips, narrow at the knees) which can hold the users' body in place. Also the aluminum between the knees and footrest can be tapered (wider at the knees, narrow at the feet) holding the feet in place. With a folding chair, you cannot taper it or it would not close completely  Rigid wheelchairs generally have more configurations and adjustments then folding chairs. Most folding wheelchairs have limits in their configurations and adjustments. For example, many folding wheelchairs do not allow for adjusting the angle between the backrest and the seat.  Many rigid models are now made with ultra-light materials such as aircraft aluminum and titanium. Another innovation in rigid chair design is the installation of polymer shock absorbers, which cushion the bumps over which the chair rolls. These shock absorbers may be added to the front wheels or to the rear wheels, or both. Rigid chairs also have the option for their rear wheels to have a camber. Wheels can have a camber, or tilt, which angles the tops of the wheels in toward the chair. This allows for better propulsion by the user which is desired by long-term users. Sport wheelchairs have large camber angles to improve stability.  An electric-powered wheelchair is a wheelchair that is moved via the means of an electric motor and navigational controls, usually a small joystick mounted on the armrest, rather than manual power. For users who cannot manage a manual joystick, head switches, chin-operated joysticks, sip-and-puff or other specialist controls may allow independent operation of the wheelchair  A power-assisted wheelchair is a recent development that uses the frame & seating of a typical manual chair while replacing the standard rear wheels with wheels that have small battery-powered motors in the hubs. A floating rim design senses the pressure applied by the users push & activates the motors proportionately. This results in the convenience, small size & light-weight of a manual chair while providing motorized assistance for rough/uneven terrain & steep slopes that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to navigate, especially by those with limited upper-body function.  We plan to rebuild wheelchairs in disrepair. These wheelchairs can be highly customized for the user's needs. Such customizations may encompass the seat dimensions, height, seat angle (also called seat dump or squeeze), footrests, leg rests, front caster outriggers, adjustable backrests and controls. Additional customizations can include various optional accessories, such as anti-tip bars or wheels, safety belts, adjustable backrests, tilt and/or recline features, extra support for limbs or neck, mounts or carrying devices for crutches, walkers or oxygen tanks, drink holders, and clothing protectors. Based on management's past experience with A&A Medical Supply in repairing wheelchairs, the time needed to rebuild a wheelchair will take us 5-6 weeks, which includes the time needed to obtain prior approval from the patient's insurance company. The basic cost to rebuild a wheel chair can be $2,000. If we were to add special features (tilt or recline chair) to the wheelchair, the price could increase by an additional $3,000.  Recent technological advances are improving wheelchairs and its technology. Some wheelchairs incorporate gyroscopic technology and other advances, enabling the chair to balance and run on only two of its four wheels on some surfaces, thus raising the user to a height comparable to a standing person. They can also incorporate stair-climbing and four-wheel-drive feature motorized assists for hand-powered chairs are becoming more available and advanced.  Wheelchair Reimbursement  The company is directly affected by government regulation and reimbursement policies in virtually every State in which the company operates. In the United States, the growth of health care costs has increased at rates in excess of the rate of inflation and as a percentage of GDP for several decades. A number of efforts to control the federal deficit have impacted reimbursement levels for government sponsored health care programs, and private insurance companies and state Medicaid programs peg their reimbursement levels to Medicare.  Reimbursement guidelines in the home health care industry have a substantial impact on the nature and type of equipment an end-user can obtain and, thus, affect the product mix, pricing and payment patterns of the company's customers who are medical equipment users. Management believes its technical expertise will allow it to respond to ongoing regulatory reimbursement changes. However, the issues described above will likely continue to have significant impacts on the pricing of the company's products.  Medicare Wheelchair Reimbursement  Manual wheelchairs are considered "Durable Medical Equipment" under Medicare guidelines. Most of the cost of a wheelchair will be covered under your Original Medicare Part B plan. A wheelchair user will have to pay 20 percent and meet your yearly Part B deductible.  In order for a wheelchair to be covered under Medicare, the requirements are:  �  It must be medically necessary, as determined by a doctor  �  A physician has documented this information for Medicare  �  The patient has a "Certificate of Necessity" (like a prescription)  �  The patient must purchase your wheelchair from a Medicare-approved supplier  Prior Approval  Before the Company can begin work on rebuilding a wheelchair, it must contact the patient's insurance provider. The insurance provider, based on the age, condition, and cost to repair the wheelchair will make a decision to approve the repairs. In many cases, where the power wheelchair is more than five (5) years old, the insurance carrier will not approve the repairs and recommend the patient purchases a new wheelchair.  Marketing Strategy  Our sole officer/director is also CEO of A&A Medical Supply, LLC, based at the same address as our company in Ohio. A&A Medical Supply, LLC is a growing medical supply company that services in the medical supply needs to patients in the Cleveland, OH area. PowerMedChairs entered into a separate Service Agreement with A&A Medical Supply to rebuild the wheelchairs brought into its shop for repairs. Currently, A&A Medical Supply receives approximately thirty (30) broken wheelchairs per month. There are no assurances, this number of repairs will remain at this level.  Additionally, the Company plans to market its services to doctors, therapists, home health care agencies in the Ohio, Eastern Indiana and Northern Kentucky areas. It is these health care provides that are the first to recognize a wheelchair in disrepair. The marketing to these individuals, will take place by sending them sales brochure on what the Company can do, and speaking directly with these providers.  If the Company's can move its business forward, management would consider building and marketing its own branded wheelchair.  COMPETITION  We may not have the resources to compete with our existing competitors or with any new competitors. We intend to compete with many other competitors who perform wheelchair repairs, all of which have significantly greater personnel, financial, and managerial resources than we do. This competition from other companies with greater resources and reputations may result in our failure to maintain or expand our business.  Moreover, as the demand for wheelchairs increases, new companies may enter the market and the influx of added competition will pose an increased risk to our Company. Increased competition may lead to price wars, which would harm us since we would be unable to compete with companies with greater resources. In addition, increased competition and increased demand may create a stress on the wheelchair manufacturers, output capabilities, which may lead to increased prices, which would also harm our ability to compete in the wheelchair market.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  We rely or plan to rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our wheelchair proprietary repair methodologies and any new wheelchair brand we might develop in the future. We currently have no pending patents nor trademarks.  From time to time, we expect that we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Also, the efforts management has taken to protect its proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of its intellectual property rights could harm the existing business, the brand and reputation, and the ability of the business to compete on a going forward basis. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming.  Employees  We currently has no employees, our CEO performs all duties related to the operations of this business. We also plan to utilize additional independent contractors on a part-time/as needed basis.  Property  Our corporate headquarters are located at: 8221 E. Washington Street, Chagrin Falls, OH 44023. We do not own any real property. Management believes that its current facilities are adequate for its needs through the next twelve months, and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate expansion of the Company's operations on commercially reasonable terms, although there can be no assurance in this regard.  Results of Operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  During the three and six month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not generate any revenues. In addition, the Company does not expect to generate any profit for the next twelve months.  For the three months ending September 30, 2016, we experienced a net loss of $3,365, as compared to a net loss of $1,595 for the same period last year. The net loss for the three months ending September 30, 2016 was attributed to $3,365 in general & administrative expenses, as compared to $1,595 in general & administrative expenses for the same period last year.  For the six months ending September 30, 2016, we experienced a net loss of $10,046, as compared to a net loss of $5,168 for the same period last year. The net loss for the six months ending September 30, 2016 was attributed to $10,046 in general & administrative expenses, as compared to $5,168 in general & administrative expenses for the same period last year.  The Company used net cash in operations of $8,823 during the six month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to using net cash of $5,168 for the same period last year. The Company was provided with $10,000 of net cash from financing activities during the six month ended September 30, 2016, as compared to no cash from financing activities for the same period last year.  Revenues  The Company has generated no revenues since its inception. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $(63,510). There can be no assurances that the Company can achieve or sustain profitability or that the Company's operating losses will not increase in the future.  Plan of Operation  The Company's plan of operation is to re-build wheelchairs in disrepair, market its services and sell wheelchairs. As of September 30, 2016, we had $10,415 cash on hand and prepaid expenses of $750. Management believes, without any additional funding or revenues, the Company has sufficient cash to finance its operations to repair and market wheelchairs, for a period of twelve months, which estimate includes the additional expenses the Company will incur as a reporting company. We will apply any proceeds from future revenues to help cover our expenditures. At this time, management does not anticipate it will be required to seek outside funding to keep its business operational for the next twelve months. However, does not preclude management from seeking funding in the future.  If we experience losses in our first year of business operations, we do not believe such losses would prevent us from continuing our operations for our first year, based on our current cash reserves. If and when the time comes that we seek funding, we plan to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. And, we would have to issue equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any of additional sales of our equity securities or other financing to fund our business operations. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources.  Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or product(s) might require the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive.  Going Concern  Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the March 31, 2016 audited financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.  Therefore, management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the Company. While the Company is devoting its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Summary of any product research and development that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation.  We do not anticipate performing any product research and development under our current plan of operation.  Expected purchase or sale of plant and significant equipment.  We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time.  Significant changes in the number of employees.  As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any employees. We are dependent upon our two officers for our future business development. As our operations expand we anticipate the need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not quantifiable at this time.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has 2,710,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had current assets of $11,165 and current liabilities of $22,500.  The Company has limited financial resources available, which has had an adverse impact on the Company's liquidity, activities and operations. In order for the Company to remain a Going Concern it will need to find additional capital or generate revenues. Additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors or stockholders),or from other available funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these. The ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought. No assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained on terms favorable to the Company, or at all.  Management believes the Company has sufficient cash assets to fund its operations and keep the Company fully reporting for the next twelve (12) months, without seeking additional outside funding.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results or operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue from product sales once all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met: pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the services have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment; and collection of the amount due is reasonable assured.  New Accounting Standards  The Company's management has evaluated all the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

Testimonials







	Both Salemen Nick Martin and Jorge Serrano are valuable assets to your company. They are helpful, professional, and pleasant. We have appreciated their input and help.
Joy - Michigan









	Your sales representative was very efficient and informative. The installation engineer was thorough and efficient. He made certain we understood each step and were thoroughly familiar with the operation and safety features and how to contact someone for support. We appreciate his attitude and kindness!
Edwin - Colorado









	Calling Acorn Stairlifts was the best decision I have ever made. I only wish I had called sooner.
Margaret - Oregon









	I was very impressed by the speed and quality of service initially on the phone. Then the speed of service with respect to quotation and installation. Both John (quote) and Bruce (installation) were extremely polite and helpful.
Ian - Vermont









	I am thrilled that I can get upstairs. I haven't been up there in 2 years. This changes everything. I'm enjoying exploring all over again. Now I don't have to ask other people to go up and get me things and I can sew again. I've even started painting pictures again. This is wonderful! I can't believe how fast I got it. The installer was a delightful person as well as the salesman. No pressure and very thorough explaining everything. A total pleasure.
Jeanette - 









	We called our old Stairlift company and it took them 8 hours to call us back, and then they would let us know about a schedule to put us on. If they had to come right away it was $150 extra. I told them I would call them (NEVER). I called Acorn and they had a salesman here within 5 hours. What a nice guy. He took size of stairs, called in the next day the lift was installed.
Ann - New York









	From first contact in 2013 through purchase in 2017 every employee was pleasant, knowledgeable and willing to help. Those who came to our home were well groomed and professional. The installer left our home clean. This product is of good quality and has several safety features...we give you a 5-star rating.
Lynda - 









	Our Acorn Stairlift has made a huge difference in our lives. Our home feels like it is 'ours' again.
Charles & Nancy - Georgia









	We started out using it right away. Very helpful for my wife who has had both knees replaced plus back surgery. I have had 3 knee surgeries. Pacemaker, 7 stints. We hope this stairlift will give us many more years in our home. We are both up in the 80-year bracket. Thank you for all of your help and installation services. 
Eugene - 









	Nice sales consultant. Best price, good instruction by installation engineer. Installed very fast – day after order was placed. Install only took 2 hours!
Richard - Maryland

EXPERIENCE AND COMPARE RAYA's UNIQUE QUALITY AT EXCELLENT PRICES








Raya Taver immigrated from Russia and began in Los Angeles in 1979

Make a Qualified Choice







Is the professional brand-name product line that you are currently promoting and selling in your salon, now easily available to your customers on the Internet, or in a Beauty Supply Store near you (possibly at a better price than you can offer).. 







Are you and your customers satisfied with the quality and efficacy of the professional products and supplies being used and sold in your Salon or Spa..? ... have you asked for our free samples Program and compared our Famous European Quality..?







Are the prices that you are now paying for professional skin care products and supplies attractive and profitable to you..? ...have you done your homework and compared them with our impressive prices ..?







4. Are you aware that some manufacturers and distributors of the well known exclusive in the past salon and spa products (to lower their costs) transferred the formulations, know how, and processing to developing countries ...?







You will find the answers to these questions and solutions to many other professional concerns when you progress through our Web Site







... Skin Care Professional: Stay Secure in Era of political and economic uncertainties ... 







Important and helpful to know :







The Internet and Globalization have created mass access to products that were designed to be exclusively sold at professional Salons and Spa. This new trend is forcing salons and Spas around the world to find alternative paths to compete and prosper







Traditionally, Salons and Spas were using professional (domestic and foreign) popular brand-name skin care products. Up to recent past, these brands were truly exclusive. Only professionals were able to purchase these products wholesale, and only through distribution channels designated by manufacturers. This process of distribution granted you a professional advantage and exclusiveness over products available in department and beauty-supply stores







Current global marketing developments such as the implementation of sales through the Internet have virtually eliminated this exclusivity. Inevitably, the Internet has made it possible for your loyal customers to access the brand-name product that you sell in your salon, in a much faster, more convenient, and more affordable way. The distributors that you rely on for your "exclusivity" are no longer able to control the spread of countless websites that offer consumers the identical brand-name products found previously only at professional Salons and Spas like yours







Now literally anyone can purchase retail in a Beauty Supply store or Online almost any salon brand-name product,







 







They are widely available on countless Internet sites 






 






This Trend Is Already Affecting Your Business:







Diminished the professional image of your Salon; 







Diminished your role as a provider of an exclusive product line; 







Inevitably caused the significant decline of your product sales and customer loyalty.







You have worked hard to establish your practice. You have struggled to maintain your clientele. You have invested monetarily as well as emotionally. Now is the time to safeguard and protect your investment.








 





MAKE A SMART MOVE TOWARD YOUR PRIVATE LABEL





Compare RAYA® quality and prices with products you are using now












Recognize, that only promoting your own name on private label (see Options of Private Labeling) skin care and cosmetic products will protect you from having your business and profits undercut by new marketing trends.






Now, as never before, it has become necessary for Salons, Spas, Estheticians, and Dermatologists to promote their name click here on their retail and back-bar products so that they can be protected from declining customer sales and loyalty.






By establishing your name on the label, you are promoting yourself, not other existing brand-named companies, and you are securing your own business. 







By buying directly from the cosmetic manufacturing company, you bypass the middle-man distribution chain and substantially cut your costs. Compare RAYA®'s prices.







In addition, by incorporating our in-salon custom blending click here techniques, you are able to customize treatments to your clients' individual needs. As a result, you are better equipped to compete in the ever-expanding and diverse skin care market.







Discover RAYA® Superior Quality and attractive prices. Compare with Brand Name Products you are using now














With Your Name on the product and our time proven European quality you are progressively securing a place for yourself in the rapidly changing market.

600 SKIN RECOVERY MASQUE





This creamy, emollient rich, antioxidant and multi-vitamin treatment mask is designed to enhance micro-circulation, improve epidermal regeneration, and naturally brighten your skin complexion. Sea Buckthorn Berry delivers effective restorative properties due to its high content of essential fatty acids, carotenes, tocopherols, and phytosterols. Elements which are all essential for healthy skin. Nutrient rich carrot oil, mango butter, and natural plant extracts help to increase the skin moisture level, oxygen uptake, and prevent early appearance of wrinkles.





Contains:





Aloe Vera Gel, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Zinc Oxide, Glyceryl Stearate, Titanium Dioxide, Sesame Oil, Safflower Oil, Squalene, Guar Gum, Sea Buckthorn Berry Oil, Carrot Oil, Extracts of Chamomile, Ginseng, Cucumber, and Ginkgo Biloba, Phenoxyethanol, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocophyrol, Ascorbyl Palmitate and Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Mango Butter, Fragrant Oils, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Marine Collagen, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid. Caution: Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Caution:





Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Professional in salon use:





This is a  moisture rich, creamy, whipped soufflé consistency nourishing mask with  a light berry scent. The yellow color comes from Carrot Oil and Sea  Buckthorn Oil. It is a non-setting type of phytotherapy mask (does not  dry on the skin). Use of masks following serums and creams improves  treatment properties and absorption of these products. Mask’s  properties could be customized to clients needs by blending appropriate  serums (Vital Silk, Vitanol A, Line Preventing Serum) and creams  (Vitaplex C, Revitalizing Cream, Bio Effective Night Cream), directly  into the mask prior to skin application. A flash “moisture boost”  effect helps to seal in the active ingredients contained in this  treatment.





In-Salon application:





Analyze your  client’s skin to determine the correct treatment mask to use. Remove  enough mask for one application with a disposable spatula from the bulk  container and place in a smaller container for skin application or  custom blending. Use on cleansed skin. Before proceeding protect the  client’s eyes with cotton pads dampened in warm water. Apply a thick  layer with a brush, spatula or fingertips (a nickel-sized amount or  more) over the entire face starting with the neck line, then jaws,  cheeks, chin, nose and forehead. Avoid applying mask to lips, mouth,  hairline, eyebrows and the area around the eyes. Ask the client if they  are comfortable. Leave on for 5 to 15 minutes. The mask should be  removed with tepid to warm water and cotton. Tone and refresh with  appropriate toner (Aloe Cucumber or Ginseng Toners) and follow with a  moisturizer or specialty product.

300 Vitamin-B Cream





This highly effective, yet very light, day cream is recommended for normal to oily, blemished and problem skin. A complex of natural botanical extracts, vitamins, and amino acids help to moisturize and balance the skin, while natural Vitamin B Complex (Yeast Extract) helps to regulate oil gland secretion to reduce the possibility of clogged pores, inflammations, and breakouts associated with an oily skin condition and the use of make-up products. After cleansing and toning, use once or twice daily.





Contains:





Aloe Vera Gel, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Decyl Oleate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Alginate, Aquas Extracts of Chamomile, and Cucumber, Blackcurrant Extract, Tamarind Extract, Apple Extract, Yeast Extract (Vitamin B), Carbomer, Ginseng Extract, Allantoin, d-Penthanol, Retinyl Palmitate, Glucose, Fructose, Sucrose, Dextrin, Glutamic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Guar Gum, Sodium PCA, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid.





Caution:





Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Professional in salon use: 





This non-greasy, water based oil control formula can be used as a final step in oily and blemished skin facial by applying over moist skin. Designed to be compatible with Camphor Soufflé, Mint Soufflé and Active Cleansing Gel cleansers, and Camphor, Eucalyptus or Blemish control astringents. For a more aggressive treatment Glycolic gel GX50 or Blemish control gel can be used prior to cream application. This cream does not leave residue.





Key ingredient functions and product benefits:





It is important to maintain a regular moisturizing routine to keep the skin from becoming too irritated or dry. Dehydrated oily skin can result in breakouts as the skin overcompensates by producing more oil. An oil control moisturizer may be desired in order to reduce shine and maintain skin’s moisture balance, therefore reducing the need for make up powders (which can contain pore clogging ingredients). The primary cause of dryness in oily skin is excessive water evaporation from the skin surface. Rich in humectants (the substances that can trap and hold water) this product helps to keep the skin hydrated while controlling oil overproduction. Amino acid complex, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Sodium PCA, and Sodium Hyaluronate provide moisture binding activity. Fruit extracts of Blackcurrant, Tamarind, and Apple help to balance the skin’s pH and control bacteria. Yeast Extract (Vitamin B) controls oil. Allantoin and Aloe Vera help to soothe problem skin. Absorbs rapidly providing immediate hydration.

	I am very pleased with the Acorn Stairlift. The salesman was very polite and professional. Life has never been so great, it was torture trying to get up and down the stairs. My wife has terrible osteoarthritis. She loves the stairlift. We will be telling everyone about it. Excuse the writing, arthritis in my hands as well. God bless you all. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

	We suddenly needed to do something to access the upstairs, the shower and bedroom. I had cut out the ad in AARP magazine, and was considering whether we could afford it and would it work in our home. I looked online at the video then called the phone number within a week we had 2 stairlifts put in. Everyone was helpful. They truly takes the worry out of getting upstairs.
Nancy - Indiana









	Overall, a wonderful experience. Our installation was very prompt and the installer was delightful.

	I am thrilled that I can get upstairs. I haven't been up there in 2 years. This changes everything. I'm enjoying exploring all over again. Now I don't have to ask other people to go up and get me things and I can sew again. I've even started painting pictures again. This is wonderful! I can't believe how fast I got it. The installer was a delightful person as well as the salesman. No pressure and very thorough explaining everything. A total pleasure.
Jeanette -

We hope this stairlift will give us many more years in our home. We are both up in the 80-year bracket. Thank you for all of your help and installation services.
