About
Pioneering Firsts in Point of Care Technology
At Exactus Inc., we're changing the game for Point-of-Care technology. We are developing for commercialization Point-of-Care diagnostics for measuring proteolytic enzymes in the blood based on a novel, proprietary detection platform. We are designing products with the potential to deliver rapid, actionable information to physicians in order to provide improved treatment decisions for patients, better health outcomes and long term reduction in healthcare costs.
Revolutionary Technologies that Address Gaps in Healthcare
Our scientific advances are working to put important health diagnostics into the hands of medical experts at the Point-of-Care. Our hand-held Point-of-Care diagnostic tools will analyze a single drop of blood using our proprietary biosensor technology.
A Transformational Approach to Measuring Blood Clotting Activity
The FibriLyzer™ is being designed to be an easy to use, handheld detection unit that uses proprietary technology to employ a disposable assay test "biosensor" strip. Using only a drop of blood, the device provides a readout of a patient's fibrinolysis status in as little as 30 seconds.
This technology will give attending physicians unprecedented access to actionable data during procedures where changes in fibrinolytic status can change quickly and that require rapid therapeutic response. The FibriLyzer™ is designed to be guide critical decisions about the treatment of patients during surgery, trauma and other conditions where patients are at risk of hemorrhage.

Making Early Intervention Possible in Cancer Recurrence
The MatriLyzer™ is designed to be a mobile screening device that monitors collagenase levels over time. Using a smartphone app, results of the test would automatically be telemetered to the patient's electronic medical record, alerting the attending oncologist of a change in the patient's status, which may necessitate a more thorough examination. The MatriLyzer would be is the only at-home test for cancer recurrence of its kind.

Empowering Physicians and Guiding Patient Care
At Exactus, Inc., we are developing products to make actionable patient data available to healthcare providers in a way that is unmatched. We are addressing current healthcare gaps with our easy-to-use, portable devices that dramatically reduce the time required to return analysis on patient blood and collagenase activity.
Revolutionary Technology in the Palm of Your Hand
Our Point-of-Care diagnostic tools will use patented technology to analyze biometric markers in a single drop of blood, revealing important insights into patient health. When physicians need to make treatment decisions, our technologies are designed to provide them with the timely health data they need.
FibriLyzer
Measuring Fibrinolytic Activity
The FibriLyzer™ is being developed to provide a simple and affordable means to assess the fibrinolytic status of patients in a broad range of applications including surgery and trauma, orthopedics, heart and stroke and chronic coronary disease management. We believe the FibriLyzer™ could provide the basis for improved management of patients who are at-risk of hemorrhage, speeding treatment decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes and saving costs.

What is Coagulation Cascade?
Once a patient suffers an injury and the blood coagulation (clotting) cascade begins, first responders and physicians must make treatment decisions that ensure the physiological process maintains a delicate balance. During the cascade, conditions could change significantly in minutes and cause fatal hemorrhaging or clotting. The ability for physicians to consider a patient's updated fibrinolytic markers in 30 seconds at the bedside is a game changer.

MatriLyzer
Measuring Collagenase Activity
The MatriLyzer™ is being developed to detect the initial occurrence or the recurrence of cancer as an at-home monitoring device or during routine office visits. The appearance of elevated levels of collagenase, the enzyme that degrades collagen, have been proven to be an early hallmark of cancer. For patients that have been previously treated for cancer (specifically, solid tumors), if and when the tumor recurs is of paramount importance.

Company Overview


Exactus is a publicly traded life science company based in Richmond, Virginia that is developing for commercialization point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for measuring proteolytic enzymes in the blood. We anticipate our lead product, the FibriLyzer™, will provide a simple and affordable means to assess the fibrinolytic status of patients in a broad range of applications and that the use of the FibriLyzer™ could provide the basis for improved management of patients who are at-risk of hemorrhage, speeding treatment decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes and saving money.
Our second product candidate, the MatriLyzer™, may be used to detect the recurrence of cancer, and can be used as an at-home monitoring device or during routine office visits. The appearance of elevated levels of collagenase, the enzyme that degrades collagen, have been proven to be an early hallmark of cancer. The MatriLyzer™ is expected to communicate directly with the attending oncologist via a smart phone application to ensure that (i) the tests are being used properly and (ii) when collagenase levels are elevated signaling the need for the patient to have a more thorough examination.

We anticipate our lead product, the FibriLyzer™, will provide a simple and affordable means to assess the fibrinolytic status of patients in a broad range of applications and that the use of the FibriLyzer™ could provide the basis for improved management of patients who are at-risk of hemorrhage, speeding treatment decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes and saving money.Our second product candidate, the MatriLyzer™, may be used to detect the recurrence of cancer, and can be used as an at-home monitoring device or during routine office visits. The appearance of elevated levels of collagenase, the enzyme that degrades collagen, have been proven to be an early hallmark of cancer. The MatriLyzer™ can communicate directly with the attending oncologist via a smart phone application to ensure that (i) the tests are being used properly and (ii) when collagenase levels are elevated signaling the need for the patient to have a more thorough examination.
