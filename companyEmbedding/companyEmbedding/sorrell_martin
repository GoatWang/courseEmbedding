Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]

Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.

WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]

Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.

Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

            The rise of the Chinese multinational   
			                        Sunday, 19 Mar 2017 |  8:54  PM ET |  02:20 




Chinese multinational companies in search of global domination should probably build their business around specific product groups, instead of trying to diversify into too many verticals, said Sir Martin Sorrell, the CEO of WPP Group. 
Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box" at the sidelines of the China Development Forum, Sorrell said companies that focus on developing their products tend to be more successful in the longer term. 
"I think focused strategies around very strict product groups are the way to go, not the diversified conglomerate strategy, which seems to be driven more by trying to diversify assets outside of China and obviously invest abroad," he said. 

Sorrell added that Chinese companies should first attempt to conquer China's vast domestic market before looking to expand abroad.
"So exhaust all the opportunities in China first, then you have to start looking at whether you go for the bigger markets, obviously like the U.S. or Western Europe, or you start to pick up some of the smaller markets that are contiguous to China, in the context of Asia Pacific, particularly given the Belt and Road (strategy)," he said.  
On Monday, WPP and Kantar Millward Brown released a study that examined the top 100 most valuable Chinese brands, where technology, banks and telecom providers led category brand value contribution in the country. 
Tencent remains China's most valuable brand, and among other recognizable technology names, Alibaba came second, Baidu fifth and Huawei sixth. Many Chinese brands are now becoming internationally recognizable due to their presence outside the mainland, according to the WPP CEO. 
"A lot of Chinese companies now are expanding abroad," said Sorrell. "Huawei is a very strong example of that, Lenovo is another. These are all companies that are building businesses abroad and you see two different strategies — one, a very diversified (strategy) like a Fosun or a Wanda, which probably is lacking a bit of focus."
The second was the "very focused strategies like (that of) Huawei, ZTE and others that are building strong brands both domestically and abroad," he added.

The study found the standout performers were brands operating in products and services that are catered for the urban middle class as China pivots to a more consumption-led economy. Education and travel agencies were the fastest-growing sectors, while technology and retail sectors remained strong, according to the study. 
Sorrell said this year's study showed the rise of the Chinese multinationals.  
"In fact, this year for the first time, in our survey of the 100 top brands here in China, I think the fifth time we've done it, ... we've seen Chinese brands eclipse some of the foreign MNCs," he said, adding the real competition that foreign MNCs now face come from companies in China, India, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia that are becoming more, and more important.

For more than three decades, Sir Martin Sorrell has run WPP – the world-leading advertising group he built from scratch out of a small maker of wire baskets – with an iron grip. Since jacking in his job as finance chief at Saatchi & Saatchi to start his own business at the very un-dotcom age of 40, Sorrell has built Wire & Plastic Products – the shell company he used as his vehicle for global domination, and which still makes metalware to this day – into a business with a stock market valuation of £22bn.
Investors have been rewarded handsomely: £1,000 invested at WPP’s inception in 1985 would be worth £63,000 today. Sorrell has been rewarded too. Two years ago he took home more than £70m, one of the biggest pay deals in UK corporate history, and over the last five years has pocketed £210m.
For years, investors were placated by WPP’s relentless growth, and questions about the control exerted by its founder were put to one side. “Like Domino’s, WPP continues to deliver,” said the company’s former chairman Philip Lader once, using fast food as an attempt to justify Sorrell’s proprietorial management style and ballooning pay.
The chief executive’s big paydays have been seen as symptomatic of what critics call “Sorrellcentricity” at WPP – the view that Sorrell is autocratic and dominates decision-making – which in turn has led investors to increasingly challenge the governance of the company.
“Sir Martin identifies very closely with WPP as his personal creation,” says Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory service Manifest. “The cult of the superstar chief executive does not create a healthy corporate culture. They’re increasingly the only person we associate with the organisation, its successes or failures. And, in fact, with any of its business decisions at all.”
A change in attitude to corporate pay from the public and investors – and more recently Theresa May’s warning that she would curb boardroom excess – has started to loosen Sorrell’s once unquestioned control. A series of investor rebellions against his pay (the biggest being in 2012, during the “shareholder spring”, when 60% of investors rejected his annual pay package) has forced WPP’s board to cut his remuneration dramatically.
Last week, WPP revealed Sorrell was paid £48m in 2016, the last year of the controversial “Leap” incentive scheme it has been forced to scrap. A new policy capping his annual pay at about £19m had already been agreed. But continued unrest among shareholders led the company to announce it would reduce pay further to a maximum of just over £13m.
This would put him much more in line with his peers. John Wren, the long-serving chief executive of the world’s second-biggest ad group, Omnicom, was paid $26m last year. Michael Roth, chief executive of rival IPG, was paid $18m.
However, the £13m cap won’t come in until 2021, when Sorrell is 76. This raises the spectre of what WPP has called the “succession elephant”, which has now superseded pay as the No 1 issue facing the company and its founder.

“Discussions with WPP have been partly about pay, the quantum, and also very much about succession,” says one major investor in WPP who does not wish to be named. “Partly the reason Sorrell’s pay has been so large is that the company has done very well. But he also got away with negotiating [big] pay packages because of the whole [unanswered] issue of succession.”
Roberto Quarta, who is a year into his job as WPP’s new chairman, said last week that succession planning had become “even more focused and detailed over the last year”. He explained there was an “exceptional team of potential candidates” from WPP’s top management, as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates”.
Claire Enders, of research firm Enders Analysis, said the perception of Sorrell’s domination is a fallacy. “Martin has a thousand great people across the world in the first tier,” she says. “Year in, year out, [the company] makes WPP a systemic large-scale success rather than the daily product of one man spinning.”
At 72, even with a new baby to deal with, Sorrell’s health and indefatigable work ethic seem to make the issue of age irrelevant. Indeed, gerontocracies are common in medialand: Rupert Murdoch is 86, Barry Diller is 75, as is Sorrell’s erstwhile adversary Maurice Lévy, who this summer will step down as chief executive of Publicis, the world’s third-largest advertising company. IPG’s Roth is 71, while Omnicom’s Wren is the sprightliest of the bunch, at 65.
Nevertheless, a new generation is on the horizon: Lévy’s successor, Arthur Sadoun, is just 46, for example.
One quirk of Sorrell’s relationship with WPP is in his contract. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, it says he can terminate his service – or that the company can – “at will”.
Sorrell may only own a few per cent of the company he founded – his stake and that of his family trust is currently worth £427m – but the idea of retirement couldn’t be further from his mind. “Only when they shoot me,” he has said.

David Teather


Saturday 3 July 2010 19.06 EDT


First published on Saturday 3 July 2010 19.06 EDT





When Sir Martin Sorrell got himself a puppy, a red setter, he named it Savage. As our car crawls through central London, from WPP's Mayfair head office to Millbank, where Sorrell is to sit on a panel, the dog sits placidly in the back, lolling its head in the sun. The name couldn't seem less apt. When Sorrell gets out, he offers a firm handshake and urges me to be nice to the mutt. "I called him Savage, because he isn't," he says.
The comment is left hanging in the air, asking to be grasped as a metaphor for Sorrell himself, who comes with a formidable reputation but in the space of the previous hour, squeezed between meetings, is charm itself.
He laughs at being called a "beancounter" and an outsider in the advertising world; he bemoans being stereotyped as a north London Jew; he makes repeated, slightly awkward jokes about his short stature and later sends an email apologising again for turning up late. It is easy to be drawn in. But for all the easy manner and self-deprecation, Sorrell has proven time and again that, unlike Savage, he has considerable bite.
It is 25 years since Sorrell took a loan out against his shares in Saatchi & Saatchi, where he had been finance director, and bought a small company called Wire and Plastic Products, which made wire baskets, and which he would build into the largest advertising and marketing services group in the world.
He has amassed so many companies that he has lost count: "Got no idea, but it is a lot. It is a lot." Some of the larger ones have included the advertising networks J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy & Mather, Grey, and Young & Rubicam; the public relations firms Hill & Knowlton and Burson-Marsteller; and a growing number of digital businesses. Revenues last year reached £8.7bn and the group employs 140,000 people; its big-name clients include Ford, BP, Vodafone and Unilever.
Along the way, he has engaged in some bitterly contested hostile takeovers, including JWT and research business Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS), making it clear that he is not above putting the odd nose out of joint. David Ogilvy famously called Sorrell an "odious little jerk", although he later had a change of heart, took a job at WPP and became lavish in his praise. Chris Ingram, former boss of media-buying group Tempus, once said he would rather "lick an abattoir floor" than work for Sorrell.
"We've done what are euphemistically called hostile situations," Sorrell says. "It is very interesting. Was it Jimmy Goldsmith [the late financier] who said there is no such thing as a hostile takeover? There isn't really. It is hostile to one person, the chief executive of the target company. It is not hostile to the share owners, it is not hostile to the clients, it is not hostile to the people who work there, so it becomes more personal in that sense."
Sorrell perhaps got some of his ruthless streak from the Saatchis, who, when he worked there, broke the gentlemen's agreement in the industry that agencies did not go after each other's client bases, he says. It was also where he honed his takeover skills. When he assumed control of WPP, the only way to grow quickly was through acquisitions. He set about building a portfolio of "below-the-line" businesses, in less glamorous industries such as direct marketing and sales promotion, "unloved and therefore cheap".
He had no clear idea how big the firm would become, he says, but knew he wanted to do something of size. "I didn't want, forgive the phrase, a Mickey Mouse kind of thing: I wanted to do something of scale. Putting it grandly, from an intellectual point of view, I thought it interesting."
He puts the decision to strike out on his own down to the "andropause" (the male menopause) after reaching 40. The advertising industry at the time, he says, was very "boys' clubby". It was also highly fragmented and consequently didn't reflect the growing global outlook and reach of its clients, making it ripe for consolidation. Plus, "there were very few barriers to entry," he says. "I mean, you needed a desk and a phone. You could go into a hotel and start an agency from a room, which you see in Mad Men."
The deal that announced he had arrived was the $566m takeover of JWT in 1987. "The funniest thing about it was we were in this tiny sort of sub-basement, rather like rats underground, bidding for a company 13 times our size. It was quite amusing." The hostile takeover of O&M for $864m two years later almost bankrupted the business.
He says he rarely sees the Saatchis any more, although he sometimes runs into Charles in Mayfair restaurants. Sorrell has become one of the best known businessmen in Britain but has never been able to shake off his own industry's view that he is something of an interloper: the Harvard-trained financier who ran roughshod over advertising.
Outsider
"I think I am an outsider," he says. "I think when we did our first high-profile deal, which was JWT, I was definitely the outsider. The picture on Ad Age had me in shirt sleeves with a plastic coffee cup and a pen and that was it. 'The Man who Would be King' was the headline. I always remember that, very funny."
A cod psychologist might think his outsider status had driven his desire to emerge as the most powerful figure in the industry, his nose pressed against the windows of advertising's Charlotte Street establishment.
"Well, a psychologist could say I have a Napoleonic complex because of my size. I am exactly the same size as Napoleon, as I have pointed out, and people have criticised me for saying it. Five foot six and a half, which, you know, French metrics, it is five foot four and a half, their feet are 13 inches or something."
It is the third joke he has made about his size in a matter of 15 minutes.
"Well, everybody likes to make it, so I like to sort of do it first," he says. "People say I am an only kid, a spoilt only boy from a middle-class family, I do find it intensely irritating that they always say 'Jewish, north-west London background' – they don't often say 'Catholic, north-east background', or whatever.
"There have been books written about why people do things and don't do things, and they point to things like: I am second generation, my grandparents came from Russia in 1907, you can go through it all … I think I had a pushy mother, a pushy Jewish mother," he laughs, "who used to wrap everything in plastic."
Rich rewards
The business has made Sorrell enormously wealthy – he has banked tens of millions from incentive schemes, £50m in 2005 alone from programmes stretching back a decade, and the stake he still has in the company is worth over £100m. Mention of the criticism directed his way over his rich rewards is the only time he becomes faintly prickly.
Rivals have it differently, he notes. "I think this is a function of the UK. Omnicom can issue options at very low prices with very little criticism. Publicis, quoted in France, can put in incentive schemes without revealing performance criteria."
Senior staff at WPP, he adds, are asked to invest their money in the company and hold the shares for five years before any payouts are possible through its share scheme. "You mention criticism, but what did I do? Virtually with one exception, I kept all my stock for 25 years and suffered with the recent changes in legislation," he says, referring to the increase in capital gains tax.
"The fact that I have held it for 25 years is not taken into any account at all, so I am going to have to pay 10% more, and the person who holds the stock for 25 minutes is treated exactly the same way. It is just not right. That is an incentive to go, not stay."
In a testament to Sorrell's status, George Osborne, the chancellor, recently said the government would change rules on the taxation of foreign earnings, in the hope that WPP would come back to Britain, after decamping to Dublin two years ago.
So will he come back? "I haven't moved, the company has moved. But the pleasing thing is that [the Conservatives] have honoured their election pledge." Revoking taxation of overseas profits "would be very meaningful" he says, "but of course one of the things is that what the coalition government guarantees does not bind the next government." The decision, he says, will be for the board.
Bath-shaped recession
If viewed huffily by his own peers, Sorrell is feted elsewhere, with invitations to the Obama inauguration and to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He has attained fame for his pronouncements on the economy; his comment that the advertising recession at the start of the decade was "bath-shaped" was often repeated. " 'Poor man's sage of Soho', as Michael Grade damningly describes me. It is a putdown, isn't it?" he asks.
His reading of the recent economic runes was LUV-shaped – the "L" representing western Europe, the "U" the United States and the "V'" the fast-growing emergent economies such as China or India. That has since been altered to LVV, reflecting his belief that the US will rebound faster than thought. Providing evidence, WPP's revenues in the first five months of 2010 are up 2% on a like-for-like basis, 5% in May alone. But then in his last big interview with the Guardian in 2008, he said, with some certainty, that there would not be a global recession. He laughs. "We have been pretty accurate after the recession, though."
Tanned and looking at least a decade younger than his 65 years, Sorrell still keeps to a punishing schedule, splitting his time between London and New York. His devotion to the company apparently cost his first marriage, which ended in a £29m divorce settlement in 2005, his former wife complaining she had been "marginalised".
The first half of the interview is in his office, down the road from film director Guy Ritchie's pub, the Punchbowl. The rest is in the car. He pulls out a piece of paper and reads that day's schedule: a presentation to institutional investors, a session with an analyst, lunch with Google, a meeting with a client, this interview, the industry panel and then a business dinner. He doesn't consider retirement. "Only when they shoot me," he says in hushed tones. The increasingly global nature of the business, the fragmentation of media and technology and the ever-quickening pace make it all the more absorbing, he says. But can it just all get too much?
"In a medical sense I probably get stressed, but I don't regard it that way; I am just annoyed when things aren't going right, and it is very personal. You know the [Bill] Shankly quote [about football]: 'It is not a matter of life and death, it is more important.' And that is what WPP is, more important."

Sir Martin Sorrell on Transformation of Advertising and of WPP
 
 






























 By Robert Andrews on March 18, 2015June 4, 2015 @robertandrews 


What does a $31 billion market cap earn the world’s largest ad agency holding group? A status as amongst the most diversified and forward-thinking of communications agencies out there.
When Sir Martin Sorrell took a controlling stake in what was then a shopping basket maker, Wire & Plastic Products, in 1985, little did most peers suspect the former Saatchi & Saatchi finance chief would go on to make WPP as influential as it is today.
WPP’s scale has grown steadily through a seemingly-neverending series of acquisitions and investments. These days, it is almost rarer for a week to go by when WPP hasn’t been involved in such a deal, as the company builds up an arsenal of marketing data, analytics, content production and other units.
So what is in Sorrell’s crystal ball for the years ahead? “I think we’ll see more consolidation. There will also be a blurring of the lines,” he tells Beet.TV in this video interview for Beet.TV’s “Media Revolutionaries” series.
That blurring is occurring partly as marketing technology vendors, who already help clients understand customer data, buy in to data-driven ad-tech platforms, and vice versa. WPP’s CEO sees an emerging middle ground on which multiple large players will all offer all manner of services their founders could not have dreamed of. But, these days, marketing firms are also editorial content makers and content platforms are also analytics providers.
“When people talk about who our competitors are, we think about Omnicom or we think about Publicis, IPG, Havas or Dentsu or Ipsos, GfK or Nielsen,” Sorrell says. “But we also think about Google, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba, we also think about Deloitte Consulting and Accenture.
“Those lines are going to get more and more blurred. You see what Salesforce is trying to do, what Adobe is trying to do, what Oracle with (its acquisition of) Datalogix is trying to do. This is all a blurring of the lines.”
It is no wonder lines are blurring. WPP itself has lately been buying in to an array of mead segments. Recent deals include pieces of Spanish football rightsholder Imagina, House Of Cards studio MRC and YouTube multi-channel network Fullscreen, long-form digital video producer Indigenous Media, FullScreen and Vice Media. The company has even invested in the formation of a new sports marketing firm Bruin Sports Capital, to double down on popular live sports, and Sorrell calls WPP “a content company” as well as everything else. But it is recent stakes in measurement firms comScore andRentrak and stake in ad tech company AppNexus that underscore WPP’s interest in numbers.
“All these are good examples of us putting a stake in the ground in tech, data, sports and entertainment,” Sorrell adds. “From a functional point of view, it’s going to become more and more competitive.”
Next, WPP is rumoured to be preparing a bid to buy Dunnhumby, the data marketing specialist that has been the catalyst behind much of UK supermarket giant Tesco’s growth, according to WSJ.
So, nevermind “Wired & Plastic Products”; WPP could soon stand for “Wide Product Portfolio”.
This is the first from Beet.TV’s “Media Revolutionaries”, a 50-part series of interviews with key innovators and leaders in the media, technology and advertising industries, sponsored by Xaxis and Microsoft.  Xaxis is a unit of WPP.
Sorrell was interviewed for Beet.TV by David J. Moore, Chairman of Xaxis and President of WPP Digital.  The interview took place in January at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show.

Insights with Sir Martin Sorrell



    
      Simon Rogers
    
  
Jul 2011







WPP Chief Executive Sir Martin Sorrell oversees operations in over 100 countries and a workforce of thousands. He's an evangelist for the new technologies shaping our world - not as a geek or a gadget freak, but as the hardest of hardheaded businessmen. In this wide-ranging interview, he discusses his approach to marketing, technology, and the changes affecting the business world.

Great white sharks cannot stop swimming; if they do, they suffocate and die. Similarly, Sir Martin Sorrell finds it hard to stand still. Our meeting in a London pub is squeezed between a visit to Turkey, talks at Downing Street and a flight to Mumbai. The head of the world’s largest advertising corporation also has his eyes on Iran and Cuba. Change and innovation are his lifeblood.
Sorrell’s rise would make great material for Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner: our plucky protagonist buys a shopping basket company and uses it to take over the world. Well, some of the world’s best-known ad firms, anyway. When he’s done, he goes to China and becomes the top man there. Now he’s got his sights set on the Middle East. And all this against three decades of momentous social, political and economic change.
Such are Sorrell’s dramatic fortunes. The 66-year-old head of WPP oversees operations in over 100 countries and a workforce of thousands. He’s an evangelist for the new technologies shaping our world – not as a geek or a gadget freak, but as the hardest of hardheaded businessmen.
Nor can he stay out of the public eye. The day after the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne’s 2011 budget announced big slashes to corporation tax, Sorrell announced he would take WPP back to the UK, having relocated to Dublin in 2008. As we meet, half a million people have just marched through London, protesting against government spending cuts. A few hundred rioted through the capital, keeping one step ahead of the police via social networks and cell phones. It’s against this backdrop that Sorrell points to the difficulty in maintaining a single message: “While some demonstrators were trying to get their message across in a peaceful and ordered way, it gets inextricably interlinked with the more violent stuff. The two things get confused,” he says.

Clients have the perception that the bigger you are, the worse you get. We try and break that down. Innovation is the ability to differentiate.

“In the old days, you could segment happily. You could put out one message to one segment of the audience, and one to another. That has now gone. You say something to one community and instantly, literally at a click, it’s available to everybody. What it means is that if you’re trying to craft a message, it’s very difficult.”
For Sorrell, that lack of control is symptomatic of the new world. “I’m in a business where there’s complete anarchy. You can’t control it – you can only react to it. The control that people traditionally had over their message is gone. Look at Wikileaks: you have to approach everything you write on the basis it’s going to be on the front page of the newspaper.”
Stocky and tough-looking (his face bears the legacy of a car accident at 18, which required extensive plastic surgery), Sorrell is a coiled spring – restlessly shifting while we talk. He attributes his drive to “the pressure cooker effect” of Harvard Business School. After graduating, he joined Saatchi & Saatchi, rising to the role of Group Finance Director before striking out on his own.
At February’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Sorrell gave a talk entitled ‘The Power of Apps’. His business increasingly revolves around mobile communications and what they can offer the client. WPP is encouraging its established brands to invest in mobile talent, and exhorting its online agencies to embrace mobile in a more aggressive way.
“Mobile for us is part of the online revolution,” he says. The side effect of all this is that “our willingness to sit down and really dig deep and take time to digest, turn over and develop more is rapidly diminishing because so much stuff is coming at you at such a pace – literally 24/7.
“It’s a disadvantage of the revolution,” he continues. “People used to say that information is power but that’s no longer the case. It’s analysis of the data, use of the data, digging into it – that is the power. You get so much of the stuff and everyone has access to it.”
His interest in technology isn’t so much personal; he doesn’t innovate for its own sake but as a means to an end. Sorrell cares about what it can do, not what it is. He plunks down a BlackBerry and an ordinary Nokia mobile on the table in front of us. He has two phones because, he says, he hasn’t “got the mental stamina to unite the two.” He doesn’t use Twitter or Facebook (“I suppose I’m a bit of a fuddy-duddy”) but his day revolves around breaking news, live business channels and his new iPad 2. He no longer uses his PC. “I don’t like schlepping a laptop around the place so I don’t travel with one.”
With its global reach and profile, has WPP become too huge to be innovative? Sorrell’s argument is that Wire and Plastic Products plc was itself a genuine game changer. A British shopping basket manufacturer acquired by Sorrell when he was casting around for a listed corporate shell in 1985, it now owns famous ad brands such as JWT, Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey – as well as media investment giant GroupM.
“We’re interested in the application of technology – not its origination. We’re not in the garage with Sergey and Larry.”
WPP’s first board meeting in China was in 1989; now the country accounts for around $1bn of business, and Sorrell describes its government’s five-year plan as a “charter for WPP.” He retains a tight control, but is quick to point out that WPP is an amorphous agglomeration of 12 different companies. “Clients have the perception that the bigger you are, the worse you get,” he admits. “We try and break that down. Innovation is the ability to differentiate.”
For Sorrell, this means working out what technology can do: “We’re interested in the application of technology – not its origination,” he explains. “We’re not in the garage with [Google co-founders] Sergey and Larry coming up with the ideas, or dropping out of Stanford or Harvard to do that. We’re taking those ideas and applying them in a way that differentiates us.”
An interesting question is whether an innovator like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg could have flourished at a company like WPP. “Mark Zuckerberg wouldn’t have been comfortable working in any company – other than going into the garage and starting his own,” replies Sorrell. “That’s what I did in 1985. My garage was Wire and Plastic Products.”
Though a man whose business relies on hard data and evidence, Sorrell isn’t averse to leaving some things to fate. He wears two Brazilian wristbands given to him on a New Year vacation. Each one promises to make three wishes come true when the string rots away. “It’s not for effect,” he insists, “I am a bit superstitious. [The wishes] haven’t come true yet, so I can’t tell you what they are.”
Away from the office, one of Sorrell’s big passions is cricket. He tries to play 10 matches a year, but is frustrated by being “a plodder, a grafter, slow but sure… You’re either good or you’re bad,” he muses as our time draws to a close. “It’s black or white, isn’t it? You don’t want to be average.”

History[edit]
The company was founded as Wire and Plastic Products plc to manufacture wire shopping baskets in 1971. In 1985 Martin Sorrell, searching for a listed company through which to build a worldwide marketing services company, bought a controlling stake of just under 30% at a cost of $676,000.[5][6] Sorrell had been the financial director for the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi from 1977 to 1985, managing its takeovers of companies in the US and the UK. The holding company was renamed WPP Group and in 1987 Sorrell became its chief executive.[5]
During 1986 WPP became the parent company of Picquotware, a manufacturer of teapots and jugs, based in Northampton. In November 1987 a fire destroyed the Northampton factory and production was restarted at Burntwood in Staffordshire. On 25 November 2004 WPP closed the Burntwood factory and stopped manufacturing Picquotware: all assets were sold on 14 December 2004.[7]
In 1987 the company acquired J. Walter Thompson (including JWT, Hill & Knowlton and MRB Group) for $566m.[5] The company listed on NASDAQ in 1988.[5] In 1989 it acquired Ogilvy Group for $864m[5] and in 1998 formed an alliance with Asatsu-DK Inc. of Japan.[5]
In May 2000, WPP agreed to acquire the United States-based advertising company Young & Rubicam for $5.7 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever takeover in the advertising sector.[8] The takeover made WPP the largest advertising company in the world measured by billings and revenue, overtaking Omnicom Group and Interpublic.[8] In 2006, WPP took over majority share of China's largest field marketing and brand activation agency, Always Marketing. Always has since been placed under the J. Walter Thompson group to provide breakthrough into the Chinese market and full on field marketing and brand activation support to JWT offices around Asia. In 2007, WPP Digital was created to develop the Group's digital capabilities. In October 2008, WPP acquired market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres for £1.6 billion.[9][10]
During 2009 WPP reduced its workforce by around 14,000 employees, or 12.3% of its then total staff numbers, in response to the onset of the 2008–2012 global recession.[11][12]
In June 2012, WPP agreed to acquire the digital advertising agency AKQA for US$540 million.[13][14] In March 2014 WPP agreed to acquire a minority stake in Swedish broadcaster FlowNetwork. [15] In July 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in the digital healthcare agency ABS Creative.[16] Then in November 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in Essence, a global digital agency. [17]
Many of WPP's constituent agencies use Microsoft Windows, and the organisation was hit hard by the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine, with some staff's computer access limited to webmail only as much as ten days later. It was suggested that poor patch management and user access administration following IT staffing cuts may have contributed to the scale of the infection affecting WPP.[18]
Operations[edit]
WPP's advertising agency company holdings include the Grey Group, Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam Brands, Landor Associates, and JWT (formerly known as J. Walter Thompson Co.).[19]
WPP's government lobbying and public relations company holdings including Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Burson-Marsteller, and Cohn & Wolfe (the last two being part of Young & Rubicam Brands).[20]
WPP's media investment management company holdings are operated by GroupM and include Mindshare, MEC (formerly Mediaedge:cia), Maxus, MediaCom (originally part of Grey Group) and Essence.[21]
WPP's research insight and consulting companies, forming a separate umbrella group known as Kantar, comprise BMRB, Added Value, Kantar Video, Indian Market Research Bureau, Millward Brown, Management Ventures Inc., Research International (which no longer exist as an entity after the merger with TNS) and TNS.[22]
Delfinware Domestic Wireware, which was established in 1969 and manufactures kitchen and bathroom wire racks, is also a subsidiary of WPP Group.[23]
Controversies[edit]
2012 shareholder revolt on executive remuneration[edit]
With a number of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies' AGMs earlier in the year, the media coverage of Martin Sorrell's intended £12.93m pay packet drew increasing public attention.[24][25] The result was a 59.52% shareholder vote to reject the resolution.[25][26]
Taxation[edit]
It has been reported that WPP goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill. The Guardian reported that between 2003 and 2009 the company paid £27m in UK corporation tax, compared to what the newspaper "might expect" based on reports of the firm making 15% of its profit in the UK, of around £126m.[27]
Television Audience Measurement[edit]
In 2012 the Indian broadcasting NDTV filed a lawsuit against Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a joint venture of the former competitors Nielsen and Kantar Media Research which for years has provided the only TV audience measurement system in India. WPP Plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of Kantar and IMRB. NDTV's lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and seeking $1.4 billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty, cited a public conversation between Vikram Chandra, CEO of NDTV, and Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, in which Chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery; his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful.[28][29][30][31][32]
WPP responded that the lawsuit had not been served on WPP or any of its operating companies, the New York court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal, seeking legal costs, and that it was considering a lawsuit against NDTV for defamation, a threat which NDTV in turn called "baseless".[33] The motion to dismiss was filed a week later, with the statement in its memorandum of law that "This case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff, a television station in New Delhi, India, to drum up media coverage in India to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years ... New Delhi TV has crossed the globe and come to New York State Supreme Court to complain about an Indian company, TAM, and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in India."[34] The motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on 14 December 2012.[35] Nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal, writing that "NDTV attempts to transform a potential contract claim against TAM into tort and oral contract claims against the Nielsen defendants. Nothing in the law supports such a magic trick. Simply put, NDTV fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action."[36]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Wire and Plastic Products plc to manufacture wire shopping baskets in 1971. In 1985 Martin Sorrell, searching for a listed company through which to build a worldwide marketing services company, bought a controlling stake of just under 30% at a cost of $676,000.[5][6] Sorrell had been the financial director for the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi from 1977 to 1985, managing its takeovers of companies in the US and the UK. The holding company was renamed WPP Group and in 1987 Sorrell became its chief executive.[5]
During 1986 WPP became the parent company of Picquotware, a manufacturer of teapots and jugs, based in Northampton. In November 1987 a fire destroyed the Northampton factory and production was restarted at Burntwood in Staffordshire. On 25 November 2004 WPP closed the Burntwood factory and stopped manufacturing Picquotware: all assets were sold on 14 December 2004.[7]
In 1987 the company acquired J. Walter Thompson (including JWT, Hill & Knowlton and MRB Group) for $566m.[5] The company listed on NASDAQ in 1988.[5] In 1989 it acquired Ogilvy Group for $864m[5] and in 1998 formed an alliance with Asatsu-DK Inc. of Japan.[5]
In May 2000, WPP agreed to acquire the United States-based advertising company Young & Rubicam for $5.7 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever takeover in the advertising sector.[8] The takeover made WPP the largest advertising company in the world measured by billings and revenue, overtaking Omnicom Group and Interpublic.[8] In 2006, WPP took over majority share of China's largest field marketing and brand activation agency, Always Marketing. Always has since been placed under the J. Walter Thompson group to provide breakthrough into the Chinese market and full on field marketing and brand activation support to JWT offices around Asia. In 2007, WPP Digital was created to develop the Group's digital capabilities. In October 2008, WPP acquired market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres for £1.6 billion.[9][10]
During 2009 WPP reduced its workforce by around 14,000 employees, or 12.3% of its then total staff numbers, in response to the onset of the 2008–2012 global recession.[11][12]
In June 2012, WPP agreed to acquire the digital advertising agency AKQA for US$540 million.[13][14] In March 2014 WPP agreed to acquire a minority stake in Swedish broadcaster FlowNetwork. [15] In July 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in the digital healthcare agency ABS Creative.[16] Then in November 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in Essence, a global digital agency. [17]
Many of WPP's constituent agencies use Microsoft Windows, and the organisation was hit hard by the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine, with some staff's computer access limited to webmail only as much as ten days later. It was suggested that poor patch management and user access administration following IT staffing cuts may have contributed to the scale of the infection affecting WPP.[18]
Operations[edit]
WPP's advertising agency company holdings include the Grey Group, Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam Brands, Landor Associates, and JWT (formerly known as J. Walter Thompson Co.).[19]
WPP's government lobbying and public relations company holdings including Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Burson-Marsteller, and Cohn & Wolfe (the last two being part of Young & Rubicam Brands).[20]
WPP's media investment management company holdings are operated by GroupM and include Mindshare, MEC (formerly Mediaedge:cia), Maxus, MediaCom (originally part of Grey Group) and Essence.[21]
WPP's research insight and consulting companies, forming a separate umbrella group known as Kantar, comprise BMRB, Added Value, Kantar Video, Indian Market Research Bureau, Millward Brown, Management Ventures Inc., Research International (which no longer exist as an entity after the merger with TNS) and TNS.[22]
Delfinware Domestic Wireware, which was established in 1969 and manufactures kitchen and bathroom wire racks, is also a subsidiary of WPP Group.[23]
Controversies[edit]
2012 shareholder revolt on executive remuneration[edit]
With a number of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies' AGMs earlier in the year, the media coverage of Martin Sorrell's intended £12.93m pay packet drew increasing public attention.[24][25] The result was a 59.52% shareholder vote to reject the resolution.[25][26]
Taxation[edit]
It has been reported that WPP goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill. The Guardian reported that between 2003 and 2009 the company paid £27m in UK corporation tax, compared to what the newspaper "might expect" based on reports of the firm making 15% of its profit in the UK, of around £126m.[27]
Television Audience Measurement[edit]
In 2012 the Indian broadcasting NDTV filed a lawsuit against Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a joint venture of the former competitors Nielsen and Kantar Media Research which for years has provided the only TV audience measurement system in India. WPP Plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of Kantar and IMRB. NDTV's lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and seeking $1.4 billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty, cited a public conversation between Vikram Chandra, CEO of NDTV, and Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, in which Chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery; his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful.[28][29][30][31][32]
WPP responded that the lawsuit had not been served on WPP or any of its operating companies, the New York court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal, seeking legal costs, and that it was considering a lawsuit against NDTV for defamation, a threat which NDTV in turn called "baseless".[33] The motion to dismiss was filed a week later, with the statement in its memorandum of law that "This case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff, a television station in New Delhi, India, to drum up media coverage in India to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years ... New Delhi TV has crossed the globe and come to New York State Supreme Court to complain about an Indian company, TAM, and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in India."[34] The motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on 14 December 2012.[35] Nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal, writing that "NDTV attempts to transform a potential contract claim against TAM into tort and oral contract claims against the Nielsen defendants. Nothing in the law supports such a magic trick. Simply put, NDTV fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action."[36]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Wire and Plastic Products plc to manufacture wire shopping baskets in 1971. In 1985 Martin Sorrell, searching for a listed company through which to build a worldwide marketing services company, bought a controlling stake of just under 30% at a cost of $676,000.[5][6] Sorrell had been the financial director for the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi from 1977 to 1985, managing its takeovers of companies in the US and the UK. The holding company was renamed WPP Group and in 1987 Sorrell became its chief executive.[5]
During 1986 WPP became the parent company of Picquotware, a manufacturer of teapots and jugs, based in Northampton. In November 1987 a fire destroyed the Northampton factory and production was restarted at Burntwood in Staffordshire. On 25 November 2004 WPP closed the Burntwood factory and stopped manufacturing Picquotware: all assets were sold on 14 December 2004.[7]
In 1987 the company acquired J. Walter Thompson (including JWT, Hill & Knowlton and MRB Group) for $566m.[5] The company listed on NASDAQ in 1988.[5] In 1989 it acquired Ogilvy Group for $864m[5] and in 1998 formed an alliance with Asatsu-DK Inc. of Japan.[5]
In May 2000, WPP agreed to acquire the United States-based advertising company Young & Rubicam for $5.7 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever takeover in the advertising sector.[8] The takeover made WPP the largest advertising company in the world measured by billings and revenue, overtaking Omnicom Group and Interpublic.[8] In 2006, WPP took over majority share of China's largest field marketing and brand activation agency, Always Marketing. Always has since been placed under the J. Walter Thompson group to provide breakthrough into the Chinese market and full on field marketing and brand activation support to JWT offices around Asia. In 2007, WPP Digital was created to develop the Group's digital capabilities. In October 2008, WPP acquired market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres for £1.6 billion.[9][10]
During 2009 WPP reduced its workforce by around 14,000 employees, or 12.3% of its then total staff numbers, in response to the onset of the 2008–2012 global recession.[11][12]
In June 2012, WPP agreed to acquire the digital advertising agency AKQA for US$540 million.[13][14] In March 2014 WPP agreed to acquire a minority stake in Swedish broadcaster FlowNetwork. [15] In July 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in the digital healthcare agency ABS Creative.[16] Then in November 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in Essence, a global digital agency. [17]
Many of WPP's constituent agencies use Microsoft Windows, and the organisation was hit hard by the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine, with some staff's computer access limited to webmail only as much as ten days later. It was suggested that poor patch management and user access administration following IT staffing cuts may have contributed to the scale of the infection affecting WPP.[18]
Operations[edit]
WPP's advertising agency company holdings include the Grey Group, Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam Brands, Landor Associates, and JWT (formerly known as J. Walter Thompson Co.).[19]
WPP's government lobbying and public relations company holdings including Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Burson-Marsteller, and Cohn & Wolfe (the last two being part of Young & Rubicam Brands).[20]
WPP's media investment management company holdings are operated by GroupM and include Mindshare, MEC (formerly Mediaedge:cia), Maxus, MediaCom (originally part of Grey Group) and Essence.[21]
WPP's research insight and consulting companies, forming a separate umbrella group known as Kantar, comprise BMRB, Added Value, Kantar Video, Indian Market Research Bureau, Millward Brown, Management Ventures Inc., Research International (which no longer exist as an entity after the merger with TNS) and TNS.[22]
Delfinware Domestic Wireware, which was established in 1969 and manufactures kitchen and bathroom wire racks, is also a subsidiary of WPP Group.[23]
Controversies[edit]
2012 shareholder revolt on executive remuneration[edit]
With a number of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies' AGMs earlier in the year, the media coverage of Martin Sorrell's intended £12.93m pay packet drew increasing public attention.[24][25] The result was a 59.52% shareholder vote to reject the resolution.[25][26]
Taxation[edit]
It has been reported that WPP goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill. The Guardian reported that between 2003 and 2009 the company paid £27m in UK corporation tax, compared to what the newspaper "might expect" based on reports of the firm making 15% of its profit in the UK, of around £126m.[27]
Television Audience Measurement[edit]
In 2012 the Indian broadcasting NDTV filed a lawsuit against Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a joint venture of the former competitors Nielsen and Kantar Media Research which for years has provided the only TV audience measurement system in India. WPP Plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of Kantar and IMRB. NDTV's lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and seeking $1.4 billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty, cited a public conversation between Vikram Chandra, CEO of NDTV, and Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, in which Chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery; his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful.[28][29][30][31][32]
WPP responded that the lawsuit had not been served on WPP or any of its operating companies, the New York court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal, seeking legal costs, and that it was considering a lawsuit against NDTV for defamation, a threat which NDTV in turn called "baseless".[33] The motion to dismiss was filed a week later, with the statement in its memorandum of law that "This case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff, a television station in New Delhi, India, to drum up media coverage in India to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years ... New Delhi TV has crossed the globe and come to New York State Supreme Court to complain about an Indian company, TAM, and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in India."[34] The motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on 14 December 2012.[35] Nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal, writing that "NDTV attempts to transform a potential contract claim against TAM into tort and oral contract claims against the Nielsen defendants. Nothing in the law supports such a magic trick. Simply put, NDTV fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action."[36]

History[edit]
The company was founded as Wire and Plastic Products plc to manufacture wire shopping baskets in 1971. In 1985 Martin Sorrell, searching for a listed company through which to build a worldwide marketing services company, bought a controlling stake of just under 30% at a cost of $676,000.[5][6] Sorrell had been the financial director for the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi from 1977 to 1985, managing its takeovers of companies in the US and the UK. The holding company was renamed WPP Group and in 1987 Sorrell became its chief executive.[5]
During 1986 WPP became the parent company of Picquotware, a manufacturer of teapots and jugs, based in Northampton. In November 1987 a fire destroyed the Northampton factory and production was restarted at Burntwood in Staffordshire. On 25 November 2004 WPP closed the Burntwood factory and stopped manufacturing Picquotware: all assets were sold on 14 December 2004.[7]
In 1987 the company acquired J. Walter Thompson (including JWT, Hill & Knowlton and MRB Group) for $566m.[5] The company listed on NASDAQ in 1988.[5] In 1989 it acquired Ogilvy Group for $864m[5] and in 1998 formed an alliance with Asatsu-DK Inc. of Japan.[5]
In May 2000, WPP agreed to acquire the United States-based advertising company Young & Rubicam for $5.7 billion, in what was at the time the largest ever takeover in the advertising sector.[8] The takeover made WPP the largest advertising company in the world measured by billings and revenue, overtaking Omnicom Group and Interpublic.[8] In 2006, WPP took over majority share of China's largest field marketing and brand activation agency, Always Marketing. Always has since been placed under the J. Walter Thompson group to provide breakthrough into the Chinese market and full on field marketing and brand activation support to JWT offices around Asia. In 2007, WPP Digital was created to develop the Group's digital capabilities. In October 2008, WPP acquired market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres for £1.6 billion.[9][10]
During 2009 WPP reduced its workforce by around 14,000 employees, or 12.3% of its then total staff numbers, in response to the onset of the 2008–2012 global recession.[11][12]
In June 2012, WPP agreed to acquire the digital advertising agency AKQA for US$540 million.[13][14] In March 2014 WPP agreed to acquire a minority stake in Swedish broadcaster FlowNetwork. [15] In July 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in the digital healthcare agency ABS Creative.[16] Then in November 2015 WPP agreed to acquire a majority stake in Essence, a global digital agency. [17]
Many of WPP's constituent agencies use Microsoft Windows, and the organisation was hit hard by the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine, with some staff's computer access limited to webmail only as much as ten days later. It was suggested that poor patch management and user access administration following IT staffing cuts may have contributed to the scale of the infection affecting WPP.[18]

WPP's advertising agency company holdings include the Grey Group, Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam Brands, Landor Associates, and JWT (formerly known as J. Walter Thompson Co.).[19]
WPP's government lobbying and public relations company holdings including Hill+Knowlton Strategies, Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, Burson-Marsteller, and Cohn & Wolfe (the last two being part of Young & Rubicam Brands).[20]
WPP's media investment management company holdings are operated by GroupM and include Mindshare, MEC (formerly Mediaedge:cia), Maxus, MediaCom (originally part of Grey Group) and Essence.[21]
WPP's research insight and consulting companies, forming a separate umbrella group known as Kantar, comprise BMRB, Added Value, Kantar Video, Indian Market Research Bureau, Millward Brown, Management Ventures Inc., Research International (which no longer exist as an entity after the merger with TNS) and TNS.[22]
Delfinware Domestic Wireware, which was established in 1969 and manufactures kitchen and bathroom wire racks, is also a subsidiary of WPP Group.[23]
Controversies[edit]
2012 shareholder revolt on executive remuneration[edit]
With a number of shareholder revolts over executive pay having already happened at other public companies' AGMs earlier in the year, the media coverage of Martin Sorrell's intended £12.93m pay packet drew increasing public attention.[24][25] The result was a 59.52% shareholder vote to reject the resolution.[25][26]
Taxation[edit]
It has been reported that WPP goes to great lengths to lower its own corporate tax bill. The Guardian reported that between 2003 and 2009 the company paid £27m in UK corporation tax, compared to what the newspaper "might expect" based on reports of the firm making 15% of its profit in the UK, of around £126m.[27]
Television Audience Measurement[edit]
In 2012 the Indian broadcasting NDTV filed a lawsuit against Television Audience Measurement (TAM), a joint venture of the former competitors Nielsen and Kantar Media Research which for years has provided the only TV audience measurement system in India. WPP Plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of Kantar and IMRB. NDTV's lawsuit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and seeking $1.4 billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty, cited a public conversation between Vikram Chandra, CEO of NDTV, and Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, in which Chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery; his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful.[28][29][30][31][32]
WPP responded that the lawsuit had not been served on WPP or any of its operating companies, the New York court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal, seeking legal costs, and that it was considering a lawsuit against NDTV for defamation, a threat which NDTV in turn called "baseless".[33] The motion to dismiss was filed a week later, with the statement in its memorandum of law that "This case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff, a television station in New Delhi, India, to drum up media coverage in India to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years ... New Delhi TV has crossed the globe and come to New York State Supreme Court to complain about an Indian company, TAM, and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in India."[34] The motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on 14 December 2012.[35] Nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal, writing that "NDTV attempts to transform a potential contract claim against TAM into tort and oral contract claims against the Nielsen defendants. Nothing in the law supports such a magic trick. Simply put, NDTV fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action."[36]

Superb shopping experience from initially landing on the website until the order arrived (it arrived FAST and safe by the way). Sweetwater's prices are excellent, and service is unmatched. I have no reason to shop anywhere else for supplies as long as Sweetwater is online.

The Martin Story
In 1833, Christian Frederick Martin, Sr., a former apprentice of noted Vienna guitar craftsman Johann Stauffer, moved his nascent guitar-making company from Germany to America, setting up a small shop on Hudson Street in  New York. Business chugged along for five years amid the hustle and bustle of the Lower West Side, and in 1838, Martin and his wife relocated to the tranquil rolling hills of Pennsylvania, purchasing an eight-acre tract just outside Nazareth. 

A Tradition of Master Craftsmanship
Early Martins were completely hand-crafted guitars, but by the 1850s, the company enjoyed sufficient sales to warrant a factory. In 1859, the company moved production from the Martin homestead to their new North Street plant in Nazareth - a location that is still in use today. By then, several proprietary, tone-enhancing features had become standard, such as the X-bracing system for guitar tops - which is still used today for all steel-string Martins. When C. F. Martin, Sr. passed away in 1873, he bequeathed to his family and the world a masterly guitar-making tradition. 

Frank Henry at the Helm
Christian Frederick, Jr. ran Martin for only 15 years until his untimely death in 1888, when his 22-year-old son, Frank Henry, took the helm. Young Frank's first challenge was the serious distribution issues the company was facing at the time. Under his bold leadership, Martin terminated its distribution agreement with Zoebisch & Sons and assumed distribution of its own products, with the company placing ads in local newspapers and Frank himself making sales calls to music dealers throughout New York State and New England. The massive influx of Italian immigrants in the 1890s greatly boosted the market for a particular instrument of Italian origin - the mandolin. So Martin started making mandolins alongside guitars, and quickly ramped up production to meet the demand.
Enter the Dreadnought
Launched in 1906, Britain's HMS Dreadnought was the first all-big-gun battleship, and the first to use steam-turbine propulsion. Larger, faster, quieter, and more deadly than any warship that had come before, it ushered in the modern era of naval warfare. In 1916, Martin christened their new large-bodied acoustic guitars named after the groundbreaking naval vessel. Martin's dreadnoughts were sold under the brand name Oliver Ditson & Co. (the East Coast music dealer whose general manager had a hand in the design) until Ditson went out of business in the late 1920s.
Roaring '20s, Depressed '30s
In the 1920s, ukuleles became very popular and Martin is estimated to have produced almost twice as many ukuleles as guitars. Business was booming - until the Great Depression struck in 1929. Instead of increased sales, survival was the directive, with the company halfheartedly branching out into areas such as violin parts and wood jewelry. Two lasting guitar innovations did come out of this dark period, however. Martin invented the 14-fret neck and refined the dreadnought concept, defining the instrument as we know it today. Traditionally, guitar necks had joined the body at the 12th fret; the 14-fret neck, developed in late 1929, increased the guitar's range and versatility.
Post-war Prosperity, and a New Factory
Frank Henry Martin passed away in 1948, and Christian Frederick III assumed his father's position as president. Post-WWII prosperity and a growing American fascination with folk music and guitars created demand that outstripped Martin's production capacity. By the early 1960s, Martin customers were looking at backorders of up to three years. The new Sycamore Street plant solved these problems, and by 1970, when Frank Herbert took the reins from his father, Martin was embarking upon a period of acquisition that included Fibes Drums and Vega Banjo Works - which were subsequently spun off, and the Darco String Company, which remains an integral part of the company to this day.
Today's Martin
Christian Frederick Martin IV apprenticed at the company for several years before joining full-time in 1978. Chris was appointed CEO and Chairman of the Board in 1986, tasked with leading Martin into the new millennium. Under his leadership, the popular Backpacker travel guitar was introduced, and Martin's limited-edition series was expanded with signature models of important artists such as Eric Clapton and Gene Autry. Participation in MTV's 1996 successful Unplugged program upped the visibility of the company. And Martin's X Series guitars took a fresh look at the way the guitar is constructed. The company set forth its ecological policy in 1990, and remains an industry leader in the use of alternative wood species, chosen for their sonic qualities and sustainability. At Martin, the innovations keep coming.

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Early life and education[edit]
Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family with an electronics retailer father,[3][4] whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania,[5] Sorrell was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School then Christ's College, Cambridge, and has an MBA from Harvard University.[3][6]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack.[7] He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as "the third brother",[8] he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‘earn-out’.
WPP[edit]
In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as Chief Executive in 1986. He began to acquire "below-the-line" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Since 2000, WPP has also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey.[9]
WPP is regarded as the driving force for the period of consolidation which has been going on within the communications industry for the last ten to fifteen years. WPP group has amassed the largest media buying group in the world, GroupM. Including its creative agency networks JWT, Ogilvy and Mather, Young & Rubicam and Grey, WPP is one of the "Big Four" major players in the global advertising industry.
WPP has become one of the world's leading communications services and advertising companies valued by the UK stockmarket at £5 billion. With billings of £37 billion and revenues of £7.5 billion, WPP's operating companies provide national, multi-national and global clients with advertising, media investment management, information and consultancy, public relations and public affairs, branding and identity, healthcare communications, direct, digital, promotion and relationship marketing, and specialist communications services. WPP employs 140,000 people in 2,400 offices in 107 countries. He owns a substantial stake in the company through a series of pay awards and his own purchases of shares. Until recently he had never before sold shares in the company; his shares are worth around £70 million.[citation needed]
Sorrell himself is widely respected throughout the advertising industry, with his words being scrutinised and quoted by many within the marketing sector. He had articulated in 1996 how interactive media—including the Internet—could transform the way we build brands and communicate to consumers in a November 1996 Harvard Business Review article, "The Future of Interactive Marketing".[10] Many industry observers credit him with the fact that the UK still has an independent, vibrant communications industry. His famed remark that the advertising recession in the early part of this decade was "bath shaped" was one of the most repeated quotes in the 2003 – 2004 period.[citation needed]
On 18 November 2008, WPP technically re-incorporated itself as an offshore entity in Jersey (Jersey is considered as a fiscal paradise by the OECD) in order to reduce an annual tax bill of more than £200million.[11]
In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP £40 million, his largest annual total since £53 million in 2004.[1]
Other interests[edit]




Martin Sorrell in 2008


In 1997, he was appointed an Ambassador for British Business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership.
He is a Governor of London Business School, and a member of the Advisory Boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also Chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK.[12] In 1998, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of Associates of Harvard Business School and to the Board of the Indian School of Business.[9]
On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020,[13] which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government.
Criticism[edit]
In 2005 Sorrell sold £9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provides him instead with no termination payment.
In 2005 his pay was £2.42 million including cash and bonuses.[14] Further he exercised £52 million in share options, is entitled to a further £5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at £15 million until 2008.[15] In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to £4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%.[16] In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages[17] at a time when real average wages in the Western world are declining.[18][19]
Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine.
In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times[20] found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R's minority interests in Zimbabwe.[21]
Recognition[edit]
He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours.[22] On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School’s highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansjorg Wyss of Synthes.[23] In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.[24]
Personal life[edit]
Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.[25][26]
Sorrell was previously married to the American-born[25] Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003, as a result of Sir Martin's "obsession with work".[25] In October 2005, he cashed in £12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce,[27] in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded a £30 million settlement including: a £3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around £90,000 each; £23.5m in cash; £2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares.[25][27][28] Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares, an estimated £80m stake in WPP, at the time of the divorce, which represented around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award.[27]
The divorce settlement was, at the time, the largest divorce settlement in British legal history,[25] and was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sir Martin — a break from the previously-established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'.[28] In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that "special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances"; Sir Martin was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sir Martin's "special contribution" to the family's wealth in justification.[28]
Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan and Robert all went to Cambridge University and then Goldman Sachs, although two have since left.[29] Jonathan is chief financial officer of the commodities hedge fund Man Group.[30]

Troubled times at WPP after remuneration vote

As Sir Martin Sorrell’s £13m pay award attracts debate, questions 
  are being asked about the make-up of the board.

 It was the evening of Tuesday February 13, 2007, and in the sumptuous surroundings of the Park Avenue Armory on New York’s Upper East Side, guests listened to Rod Stewart and Patti LaBelle to celebrate a dear friend’s 60th birthday.  Those seated close to the birthday boy – Blackstone chairman Steve Schwarzman – included Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, and Jeffrey Rosen, Lazard banker and the media conglomerate’s senior independent director.  In the speeches that followed the meal of lobster and beef tournedos, Schwarzman even doffed his cap, metaphorically speaking, to Sir Martin, as one of three guests who shared a similar birthday to him, falling a day later on Valentine’s Day. But if there was a lot of love and warm feelings in the room that night among the gathered friends, the atmosphere could not have been more different among the 150 or so people gathered in the somewhat less salubrious confines of Dublin’s The Convention Centre last Wednesday afternoon.  After almost two hours of presentations on the state of the business at the company’s AGM from Sorrell and WPP chairman, Philip Lader, it became clear that the mood was turning against the three men and the rest of the FTSE 100 company’s board. For many, Rosen, there as a board member and chairman of WPP’s remuneration committee, which sets pay, was the problem. The bad feeling was in spite of the fact that slide after slide during the presentation demonstrated WPP’s continued growth, its 18.5pc rise in pre-tax profits to £1bn last year and the fact that it has the fourth best total shareholder return in the FTSE 100. Some £1,000 invested in WPP in 1985 is worth £44,000 today including dividends.  Questions were thin on the ground, but to those present there was only one thing that mattered: the near-£13m remuneration package awarded to Sir Martin for the 2011 financial year, which included a £300,000 rise in his base salary to £1.3m.

WPP: a history

13 Jun 2012



 As the results of the vote on board pay became known – with 59.5pc of those shareholders who voted coming out against the remuneration report – the board knew it had a major issue on its hands.  For a company whose raison d’être is marketing and communication, it was telling that the leadership had badly misjudged the mood among shareholders and had become the fifth FTSE 100 constituent this year to see a “no” vote on its board pay packages.  While the intricacies of Sir Martin’s pay have been the subject of much debate for the past three weeks, the very make-up of WPP’s board is thought to be one of the other key reasons why it is thought the sizeable “no” vote occurred in the first place.  The 16-man board comprises three executive directors – Sir Martin, and his finance and strategy directors – and 13 non-executives, led by Lader. Of the 13, based on their appointment letters, seven are based in the US, four in the UK, one in China and one in Japan. But the four who appear to be based in the UK, only two – Filtrona chief executive Colin Day and financier Paul Spencer – are actually based here permanently. WPP point to the international nature of the company’s revenues – with only 10pc of revenue in the 2011 financial year coming from the UK – as the reason why the board is so geographically dispersed.  But the fact that WPP’s board members are not majority-based in the country of its primary stock market listing means they appeared to be less aware of the growing political sensitivities around executive pay in the UK that began long before the current “shareholder spring”. On the compensation committee, the American bias is even more stark. Of the five members, only one, Day, is not based in the US.  As one top-15 shareholder said: “It’s all very well having an international board, if they are not alive to the issues the company faces, no wonder things like this [the ‘no’ vote] happen.”  But there are other factors at work within the board dynamic that could also have meant a lack of challenge to the perceived wisdom when it came to setting pay and lack of sensitivity to changing outside events. Tenure is one of them. The longest-serving board director is John Quelch, a British academic now based in Shanghai, who has been on the board for 24 years. A former US investment banker, Bud Morten, has been on the board for 21 years. Mr Lader has been on the board for 11 years. Corporate governance standards suggest a director is no longer deemed to be “independent” after nine years.  Of WPP’s 13 non-executive directors, four fall into this category, while another four are less than a year away from serving three three-year terms.  Although it is not known if Sir Martin and Lader are close beyond the minimum 12 days the chairman’s contract says he must work in return for a fee of £425,000 a year – quite substantial compared with Lloyds Banking Group chairman Sir Win Bischoff who receives £700,000 for working four-days a week – the pair do connect outside business.  Lader is a director of the Atlantic Council, the US-centric think tank, on which Sir Martin sits on the international advisory board. The one-time White House deputy chief of staff is also a senior adviser to Morgan Stanley, one of WPP’s banking advisers. Both Lader and Rosen, who also chairs WPP’s compensation committee and is its senior independent director, are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.  As the birthday bash in New York revealed, Sir Martin and Rosen are both friends of Schwarzman. What is clear is that all three operate in the same circles.  When it comes to pay, although it is Sir Martin facing all the negative headlines, it is the board and the remuneration committee that sets pay, and that process was led by Lader and Rosen.  According to those close to the company, the pair decided not to consult shareholders on Sir Martin’s package following heavy consultation in the prior financial year that led to media leaks and a row about Sir Martin’s remuneration before it had even been decided. One senior source within the company this weekend admitted: “I think that was the basic mistake. It would have been much, much better if they’d continued the consultation process.”  The level of resentment towards the pair was in part reflected in the voting, with 11.8pc voting against Mr Lader’s re-election, and 21.8pc voting against Rosen. In contrast, Sir Martin was voted against by less than 2pc of shareholders.  As Lader and Rosen begin to consult with investors on the next steps – likely to include a possible redrawing of Sir Martin’s pay package along with a potential re-pitch for WPP’s executive pay consultants, Towers Watson – it is clear that the problems that led to the “no” vote in the first place are not necessarily easily resolved.  Insiders with awareness of the proxy votes indicate that institutional voters fell largely into two camps. One, those who chose to back the remuneration report, believed to include BlackRock, Capital and T Rowe Price. The other, who voted against, included Standard Life, Scottish Widows and Hermes.  Among those who chose to vote against, the reasons were mixed. Standard Life is believed to have signalled it did not have a problem with Sir Martin’s pay rise, but it did object to his pension increase. A second blue-chip investor said Sir Martin should only be paid if the share price increases, while another pushed for return on equity to be included in the hurdles required for him to jump to receive his long-term performance awards.  On top of those opinions comes the divergence between the fund managers who buy and manage stakes in the company, and their corporate governance departments, which lead voting at annual meetings.  At a number of major fund managers there is said to have been a distinct difference of opinion on how to vote on pay at the WPP meeting, with the corporate governance department winning on most occasions.  One senior source indicated that the continued political pressure on executive pay – which will this week see Vince Cable unveil a new series of rules on the subject – has in no small part triggered the “Shareholder Spring”.  “Why has all this happened? The reason in part is because the Government, both under Brown and under the Coalition, has said to institutions to act on executive compensation. It is a political issue,” said the source. “If they’re not careful, they’re worried the Government will put their own pay under the microscope, which they don’t want.”  What happens next will be the subject of much debate in coming weeks as Lader and Rosen undertake the difficult task of appeasing shareholders while at the same time not aggravating Sir Martin, who owns a 1.4pc stake in the business worth £134m.  At close of the markets on Friday, WPP was worth £9.5bn.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
