CONSULTING SERVICES








One World Cannabis believes that the complexity of the medical cannabis programs has created a demand for consulting and advisory services in different aspects of the medical cannabis industry. The Company’s services are designed to help government officials, policy-makers and regulatory agencies develop and implement tailor-made comprehensive medical cannabis programs. In addition, One World Cannabis offers medical cannabis regulatory compliance services and patient-care consultancy services.
Our initial activities to secure consulting contracts will be in member states of the European Union and states of the United States that does not allow for comprehensive public medical cannabis programs.
One World Cannabis has the experienced and knowledgeable team needed to develop and implement a comprehensive medical cannabis program. We offer policy makers a turnkey project and we plan to work with our clients to address all matters related to the medical cannabis program:  from drafting a version of the legislation and regulation tailored to the state’s specific needs; through running a small-scale medical cannabis program for a trial period; to operating the program nationwide.
The Company’s management has the expertise in designing training programs for physicians, caregivers, and researches that are essential to the establishment of a successful, patient-focused medical cannabis program. By working with policy-makers, government officials, public agencies, and privately owned businesses, we believe we can also raise the public’s awareness of the benefits of cannabis-based treatments and products.

OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. (OTCQB: OWCP) operates as a Israel-based medical cannabis and testing company. Shares of the cannabis company are rallying 15.15%, through afternoon trading on Tuesday, June 27, 2017. Over the past month, OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. has seen average daily volume of 647,345 shares. However, volume of 4.21 million shares or dollar volume of $3.2 million, has already exchanged hands on Tuesday.
Shares of OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. are gaining today, after the company announced it has filed a full patent application in the United States for its CBD-based topical cream product. The company previously held a provisional patent on the technology. This comes as the company prepares the market readiness of the product. Here is the full press release detailing of the CBD topical cream:
OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. Press Release:
PETACH TIKVA, Israel, June 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ –OWC Pharmaceutical Research Corp. (OTCQB: OWCP) today announced that its wholly-owned, Israel-based subsidiary, One World Cannabis Ltd. (OWC), has filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for its active cannabinoid-based topical cream. This new patent application follows the previously filed ‘provisional’ patent application. The added protection that this patent application provides for OWC’s intellectual property will enable the Company to accelerate its ongoing discussions and negotiations regarding scientific, medical and commercial collaboration.
     (Logo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/458036/OWC_Logo.jpg )
Commenting on the filing of the patent application, Mr. Mordechai Bignitz, Chairman and CEO of OWC Pharmaceutical Research, stated, “After we announced the highlights of our pre-clinical efficacy study for our active, cannabinoid-based topical cream, starting with psoriasis, we received numerous inquiries from firms and organizations worldwide interested in purchasing the cream or initiating commercial or scientific collaboration with OWCP. The need to fully protect our intellectual property limited our ability to provide these potential customers and partners with our proprietary data. This proprietary data now includes specifics regarding the formulation of the cream, which consists of cannabinoids and other compounds that facilitate the efficient delivery of the product to infected areas. The filing of this patent application also enables us to discuss with potential customers and partners, the requirements for manufacturing the cream in accordance with the highest global standards that comply with international protocols, and includes specifics regarding required equipment and systems. We look forward to announcing a more specific plan of product launch details in due course.”
Further commenting on the milestone, Dr. Yehuda Baruch, the Company’s Chief Science Officer and OWC’s Director of Research and Regulatory Affairs ,stated, “I am very proud of the extensive research we have done at OWC Pharma. This research dates back to 2014 and also includes the many studies myself and my medical team have conducted while leading the Medical Cannabis Program under the Government of Israel and treating thousands of patients with cannabis for medical purposes over the years. I feel confident our topical cream will be welcome into the Psoriasis community as there are millions who suffer from this disease across the globe.”
About OWCP’s Active Cannabinoid-based Psoriasis Cream
Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes red, scaly patches to appear on the skin, and can be associated with other serious health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease and depression. Skin cells in patients with psoriasis grow at an abnormally fast rate, causing a buildup of lesions that tend to burn and itch. While the real cause of psoriasis is not known, genetics are believed to play a major role in its development. According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, psoriasis affects 7.5 million people in the United States. According to Global Data and the World Health Organization, the reported prevalence of psoriasis in countries ranges between 0.09% and 11.4%, making psoriasis a serious global problem with at least 100 million individuals affected worldwide. The global market of psoriasis treatments expected to increase from a value of $6.6 billion in 2014 to more than $13.3 billion by 2024.
OWCP has developed a proprietary active cannabinoid-based topical cream for psoriasis management, with the objective of reducing the skin dryness of patients suffering from the disease. It was shown from these studies that OWC topical cream treats the main symptoms of psoriasis mainly reducing keratinocytes (epidermis cell) proliferation and reducing inflammation markers related to psoriasis. The Company previously reported trial results that concluded that after application of the Company’s active cannabinoid-based topical cream formulation, there was up to a 70% improvement in a variety of inflammation markers directly associated with Psoriasis.
