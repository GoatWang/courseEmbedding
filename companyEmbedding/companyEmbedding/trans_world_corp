                    Spinoff Approved At Trans World Shareholders of the Trans World Corporation voted overwhelmingly in favor of proposals that will spin off Trans World Airlines from the company. Under one proposal, the 81 percent holding of the parent company in the airline will be distributed to Trans World stockholders at the rate of about 0.93 share of T.W.A. stock for each Trans World share. Under a second proposal, the incentive compensation plans of the two companies were separated.                
After the spinoff, which is expected to become effective Feb. 1, Trans World will be left with four major subsidiaries that have been consistently profitable. The airline's earnings have fluctuated widely, showing heavy losses for the last two years. The four units are Spartan Food Systems Inc., which owns and operates 423 restaurants; the Canteen Corporation, a vending and direct food service business; Hilton International, which operates 90 hotels, and the Century 21 Real Estate Corporation.











                    T.W.A. CHIEF CALLS UNION PACTS CRUCIAL                
C. E. Meyer, the president and chief executive officer of Trans World Airlines, said yesterday that $51 million in concessions that leaders of its pilot union had agreed to was an important first step in reaching the $197 million needed to make the airline profitable next year. Speaking at the airlines headquarters here a day after the board of directors of the Trans World Corporation had decided to spin off the airline, he also said that without the support of the parent, the company would find it more difficult to raise credit. The 55-year-old president, however, also saw some pluses. He said the move would help dispel the illusion among the airline's three major unions and employees that ''the parent is there to take care of us.''











                    TRANS WORLD APPROVES SPINOFF FOR T.W.A.                
The Trans World Corporation, in a five-hour directors' meeting in San Francisco yesterday, approved plans to spin off its Trans World Airlines subsidiary as a separate company. The company said no details of the board's action would be available until today. But based on tentative outlines of the proposal, stockholders would receive 93 shares in the airline for each 100 shares of common stock they now hold in the parent company. The spinoff - which will require shareholder approval at a meeting in December - was viewed as Trans World's response to an unsuccessful proxy fight by Odyssey Partners last summer to dismember the company.











                    Spinoff Talks On T.W.A.                
The board of directors of the Trans World Corporation will consider at a meeting on Wednesday a proposal to spin off its subsidiary, Trans World Airlines, an industry source said today. He said he expected the board to vote for a spinoff. T.W.A. had a pretax loss of $108.9 million in the first six months of this year on revenues of $1.5 billion.











                    SPINOFF OF T.W.A. ADVANCES                
The Trans World Corporation yesterday moved closer to spinning off its Trans World Airlines subsidiary, which has been beset by heavy losses. At a meeting in Chicago, Trans World's board instructed management to develop a detailed program under which the parent company's holdings of 81 percent of T.W.A.'s stock would be distributed to Trans World's common stockholders. The proposal, which had been expected since last February when the parent company made a public offering of 5 million shares of the airline, would establish T.W.A. as a separate publicly owned company. At the same time, it would relieve Trans World of its only unprofitable unit.
