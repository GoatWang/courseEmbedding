About Blum
   Blum manufactures functional kitchen cabinet hardware of the highest quality under the philosophy, "We don't make kitchens; we make kitchens work easier." Since 1977 Blum has been creating innovative functional kitchen cabinet hardware unlike any other company. It got its start in a small warehouse in Hickory, North Carolina and quickly outgrew the establishment. Today the company operates out of a 450,000 square foot building and employs almost 400 people. Once you have experienced the quality craftsmanship of Blum hardware you will understand how the company has grown so rapidly. Browse PullsDirect.com to become familiar with the extraordinary offerings from Blum.  Blum BLUMOTION is a favorite among kitchen owners all over the world and is available in several of its products. BLUMOTION is a technology that allows for the smooth and silent closing of a cabinet door or drawer on every repetition. BLUMOTION is available as an integrated featured on select Blum hinges. The functionality is built into the internal mechanism so it operates out of sight. It is also available as a clip on device to add BLUMOTION to your existing cabinet hinges. The technology adapts to different situations, resulting in a consistent soft close, regardless of weight or closing force. Once you experience the freedom from banging cabinet doors, you will never stray from BLUMOTION by Blum. Blum hinges are designed to satisfy the needs of today's kitchen. They are extremely functional, quiet, and long-lasting. This is what makes thousands of consumers and cabinet makers choose hinges by Blum every day. Another thing you'll want to consider when selecting a cabinet hinge is a good opening angle. The most common Blum hinge angles are 110 and 120 degrees. Blum 110 hinges allow you to view all of the contents in your cabinets without having the door in your way. Blum also offers the ultimate in opening angles, offering a 170 degree angle. This may be necessary in certain applications but in most instances the 110 hinge will suffice. All of Blum's cabinet hinges have a concealed design, meaning they are hidden from view when the cabinet is door is closed. Concealed hinges work well on any application, but are especially beneficial for cabinets with face frame construction. Within this lineup of concealed hinges, Blum has several styles to choose from. The most popular is the compact 33 hinge. The 33.3600 is a prime example of a compact hinge that offers every feature in a condensed package. It features a 110 degree opening angle, is face or edge mount, and is height and side adjustable.  Drawer slides by Blum feature many of the same innovative technologies as its cabinet hinges. Often referred to as drawer runners, these products work well with any type of drawer. Blum TANDEM is the premier concealed slide for wooded drawers. TANDEM offers a wide range of drawer lengths and works well with drawer material ranging in widths from ½" to ¾". Weight capacities are available up to 110 pounds to accommodate drawers with the heaviest of objects. TANDEMBOX is a complete drawer system that can be used to build a new drawer. Both of these styles feature BLUMOTION to make them a desirable addition to any kitchen, bathroom, or office. The METABOX collection is also used to construct a drawer. The METABOX system doubles as the sides of the drawer as well as the slides, making construction very simple. No joinery, glue, or clamping is required for attachment of the bottom or back of the drawer. The bottom of the drawer rests on the pins of the METABOX system and the back is screwed on. The drawer is completed by screwing the included brackets onto the drawer's front, and then clipping them onto the METABOX slides/sides. This fast, easy, and accurate system is ideal for both new construction and updating existing cabinetry. Designed to perfect the motion of lift systems for wall cabinets, Blum recently launched the AVENTOS collection. This innovative line is focused on perfecting motion and design while keeping the installation process simple. Within the Blum AVENTOS collection are sub-categories to accommodate each type of wall cabinet. Blum offers bi-fold, up-and-over, lift-up, or stay-lift, to ensure the proper lift system for your application.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, PullsDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require PullsDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at PullsDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					PullsDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. PullsDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, PullsDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require PullsDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at PullsDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					PullsDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. PullsDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Hinge Type

Hinge Type
Ball Bearing hinges are the go-to hinge for most applications, they tend to out perform plain bearing hinges in that they require less maintenance and produce less wear and less noise.



Mortise Hinges are recessed into the door and the jamb which allows the door to close completely. Typically these hinges are also much more wear and weather resistant, as well as heavier duty than your standard ball bearing hinge.



Plain Bearing Hinges are most often the cheap alternative to Ball Bearing Hinges. These hinges produce the most wear on their internals and are often noise makers if not maintained well. They are a great alternative for upgrades on a tight budget.



Spring Hinges are great when used as screen door closers or cabinet door closers. These hinges are designed for light weight doors and ensure the door is kept closed automatically.



Strap Hinges are decorative and functional. These hinges are common on barn doors and can give you a rustic or traditional look if thats what you desire.

Hinge Corners



Hinges with rounded corners can easily be identified by comparing them to the radius of a US Dime or Quarter. 1/4 Inch Radius Hinges match up very closely with the radius of the Dime, and 5/8 Inch Radius Hinges match up very well with the Quarter. Square corner hinges have sharp cornered points.

Brad Blum, born 1953, was the CEO of Burger King from December 2002 to July 2, 2004. He joined the company from Darden Restaurants where he had headed the Olive Garden unit,[1] but left after only 18 months citing strategic differences with Burger King's board.[2] Blum's successor, Greg Brenneman, was appointed on August 1, 2004. Blum was the CEO of Romano's Macaroni Grill from December 2008 to July 2010.[3]

Education[edit]
Blum graduated from Denison University with a BA in Economics and Urban Studies. He continued his formal education by earning an MBA in marketing and finance from Northwestern's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
Career[edit]
General Mills[edit]
After college, Blum worked with General Mills as a marketing executive. He worked at General Mills on both a national and international level.
Blum helped to lead a start-up company called "Cereal Partners Worldwide" (CPW) in Switzerland; they had partnered up with Nestlé for an equal interest in the company, 50/50. Cereal Partners Worldwide is a large international company with sales exceeding $2,500,000 per year. Blum is credited with putting the first female athlete on a Wheaties box (Mary Lou Retton), and with putting the first African American athlete on a Wheaties box (Walter Payton). Blum also invented a new cereal for General Mills: Cinnamon Toast Crunch, the company's most profitable brands[4]
Olive Garden[edit]
Starting in 1994, Blum left General Mills and joined Olive Garden as its new president. For the next eight years he oversaw Olive Garden's growth. Under Blum's leadership as the chief executive, Olive Garden achieved 57 consecutive quarters of same-restaurant sales increases, with continually increasing profits. The company's restaurant branch average increased by 67 percent during Blum's time there. In 2000, he won the MUFSO (Multi-Unit Foodservice Operators) Operator of the Year, a very high honor within the restaurant industry. In early 2002, he left Olive Garden.[4]
Darden Restaurants[edit]
In March 2002, Blum moved further up the ladder to become Vice Chairman of Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden restaurant chain. Because of his leadership, Olive Garden became Darden's most successful and recognizable company. Blum oversaw Olive Garden and Smokey Bones (considered one of Darden's most promising new restaurant companies). Darden was, and is, considered the largest casual dining restaurant company in the world, and Blum oversaw quality assurance, purchasing, and distribution for all the brand-name restaurants that Darden owned. Purchasing included the very fickle and mercurial business of global fish and seafood supply for Red Lobster. Blum also evaluated up and coming restaurants for newly prospective acquisitions.[4]
Burger King[edit]
Blum was named the CEO of Burger King in late 2002, having been hired to turn the declining company around. He was hired after Diageo sold Burger King Corporation to the private equity group of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs. During his tenure at Burger King, Blum oversaw the company's improvement in its financial performance. In his first year, profits doubled and positive growth was trending; the average restaurant sales increased from a loss of 7% to a growth of 4%. This proved advantageous when the company initiated an IPO in 2006.[4]
Romano's Macaroni Grill[edit]
In late 2008, Romano's Macaroni Grill was suffering declines in sales, profits, and market share of the casual dining industry, and hired Blum as its CEO. He oversaw a turnaround in the same-restaurant sales from an annual loss of 11% to a 3% profit. Macaroni Grill's change in fortunes was partially based on a complete revamp the chain's menu, reorienting its cooking style on a more Mediterranean method of preparing and cooking food. In the first fifteen months, the changes to the menu not only improved the quality of the chain's products but also lowered its production costs. The caloric content of the products was reduced by 49% from the previous menu, along with a 59% reduction in fat and a 46% reduction in sodium. Blum's name for the change was called "Quality up, Costs down." As a result of these menu improvements, customer satisfaction rate for the chain grew. In May 2010, Nation's Restaurant News named Blum the Menu Master's Innovator of the Year in the restaurant industry for his accomplishments at Macaroni Grill.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Blum's hometown is Cincinnati, Ohio. His hobby is auto racing.[5]

The company's restaurant branch average increased by 67 percent during Blum's time there. In 2000, he won the MUFSO (Multi-Unit Foodservice Operators) Operator of the Year, a very high honor within the restaurant industry. In early 2002, he left Olive Garden.[4]
Darden Restaurants[edit]
In March 2002, Blum moved further up the ladder to become Vice Chairman of Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden restaurant chain. Because of his leadership, Olive Garden became Darden's most successful and recognizable company. Blum oversaw Olive Garden and Smokey Bones (considered one of Darden's most promising new restaurant companies). Darden was, and is, considered the largest casual dining restaurant company in the world, and Blum oversaw quality assurance, purchasing, and distribution for all the brand-name restaurants that Darden owned. Purchasing included the very fickle and mercurial business of global fish and seafood supply for Red Lobster. Blum also evaluated up and coming restaurants for newly prospective acquisitions.[4]
Burger King[edit]
Blum was named the CEO of Burger King in late 2002, having been hired to turn the declining company around. He was hired after Diageo sold Burger King Corporation to the private equity group of Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs. During his tenure at Burger King, Blum oversaw the company's improvement in its financial performance. In his first year, profits doubled and positive growth was trending; the average restaurant sales increased from a loss of 7% to a growth of 4%. This proved advantageous when the company initiated an IPO in 2006.[4]
Romano's Macaroni Grill[edit]
In late 2008, Romano's Macaroni Grill was suffering declines in sales, profits, and market share of the casual dining industry, and hired Blum as its CEO. He oversaw a turnaround in the same-restaurant sales from an annual loss of 11% to a 3% profit. Macaroni Grill's change in fortunes was partially based on a complete revamp the chain's menu, reorienting its cooking style on a more Mediterranean method of preparing and cooking food. In the first fifteen months, the changes to the menu not only improved the quality of the chain's products but also lowered its production costs. The caloric content of the products was reduced by 49% from the previous menu, along with a 59% reduction in fat and a 46% reduction in sodium. Blum's name for the change was called "Quality up, Costs down." As a result of these menu improvements, customer satisfaction rate for the chain grew. In May 2010, Nation's Restaurant News named Blum the Menu Master's Innovator of the Year in the restaurant industry for his accomplishments at Macaroni Grill.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Blum's hometown is Cincinnati, Ohio. His hobby is auto racing.[5]

Brad Blum, born 1953, was the CEO of Burger King from December 2002 to July 2, 2004.

Blum was the CEO of Romano's Macaroni Grill from December 2008 to July 2010.[3]

Education[edit]
Blum graduated from Denison University with a BA in Economics and Urban Studies. He continued his formal education by earning an MBA in marketing and finance from Northwestern's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
Career[edit]
General Mills[edit]
After college, Blum worked with General Mills as a marketing executive. He worked at General Mills on both a national and international level.
Blum helped to lead a start-up company called "Cereal Partners Worldwide" (CPW) in Switzerland; they had partnered up with Nestlé for an equal interest in the company, 50/50. Cereal Partners Worldwide is a large international company with sales exceeding $2,500,000 per year. Blum is credited with putting the first female athlete on a Wheaties box (Mary Lou Retton), and with putting the first African American athlete on a Wheaties box (Walter Payton). Blum also invented a new cereal for General Mills: Cinnamon Toast Crunch, the company's most profitable brands[4]
Olive Garden[edit]
Starting in 1994, Blum left General Mills and joined Olive Garden as its new president. For the next eight years he oversaw Olive Garden's growth. Under Blum's leadership as the chief executive, Olive Garden achieved 57 consecutive quarters of same-restaurant sales increases, with continually increasing profits. The company's restaurant branch average increased by 67 percent during Blum's time there. In 2000, he won the MUFSO (Multi-Unit Foodservice Operators) Operator of the Year, a very high honor within the restaurant industry. In early 2002, he left Olive Garden.[4]

— Roni, Owner, Bella Prana Yoga & Meditation 


I recently hired Nita to create a wellness website for me in the hopes of garnering more clients and I was thrilled with the final product. I hired her to shoot photos, create the site and market my services to people who would be interested in my brand. Everything from the beautiful photos to the tailored look of the site were exactly how I would have wanted my brand to be presented. In addition, the marketing tips and tools have really helped my site gain new clients who wouldn’t have been able to find me online with her skill and knowledge. 

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
