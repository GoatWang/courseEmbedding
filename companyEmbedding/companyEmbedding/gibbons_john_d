You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

In July 2017, Gibbons was chosen as one of the Best Small and Medium Workplaces in New York. The firm ranked 14th and was the only law firm chosen for this year's list. Published together with Fortune, The Best Workplaces in New York ranking is based entirely upon feedback from employees at Great Place to Work–Certified™ companies either headquartered or with major locations in New York who completed their Trust Index Employee Survey.
