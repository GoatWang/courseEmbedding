Timeline of corporate name and structure changes[edit]

April 21, 1862, the charter of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company was approved by John A. Andrew, governor of Massachusetts.
John Hancock advertisements and newspaper articles from the 1930s refer to it as the "John Hancock Life Insurance Company".
1940s source refer to it as the "John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company".
A July 2, 1998, Boston Herald story, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. chairman, is quoted: "We have always said quite clearly that we are not for sale," [Stephen L.] Brown said, moving to kill speculation about possible deals with BankBoston or Fleet Financial Group. "There are simply no merger talks going on."
In 2000, led by David F. D'Alessandro, the company "demutualized", meaning that "John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company" formally ceased to exist, and a new company named "John Hancock Financial Services, Inc." came into existence. Policyholders received shares in the new company in exchange for giving up ownership in the old. Life insurance continued to be sold by an entity known as the "John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company", a subsidiary of John Hancock Financial Services Inc. On January 27, 2000, shares of Hancock stock started to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JHF.
On September 29, 2003, it was announced that Manulife Financial Corp. was acquiring John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. for $10.4 billion.
On April 29, 2004, the existence of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. as an independent company formally ended.
During 2004, Manulife merged its original U.S. domiciled business units with the newly acquired company under the John Hancock name.
Manulife continues to use the John Hancock brand name for the majority of its U.S. businesses.

Investor Sentiment Index[edit]
John Hancock created an index called the "John Hancock Investor Sentiment Index" in 2011.[2] The company describes the index as a "quarterly measure of investors' views on a range of investment choices, life goals and economic outlook."[2]

John Hancock Insurance

With more than 150 years of delivering on our promises and backed by strong financial ratings, John Hancock offers life insurance that can benefit you at all stages of life.

Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

5 Common Questions About Life Insurance

                                    Starting a family is one of the most exciting times in your life, but it can also feel overwhelming. You probably have questions, and that’s a good thing.
                                





Insuring a Long Life is More than a Policy

                                    Scott is at a stage of life that is full of new adventures and responsibilities, many of which bring new financial pressures for young families.

Insurance policies and/or associated riders and features may not be available in all states. Insurance products are issued by: John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.), Boston, MA 02210 (not licensed in New York) and John Hancock Life Insurance Company of New York, Valhalla, NY 10595.

The performance data shown represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See performance data current to the most recent month-end, which may be higher or lower than that cited.

Performance figures assume that all distributions are reinvested.

         Morningstar Rating1



       Overall Rating
       

       The fund has not yet been rated by Morningstar.
       


       Overall Ratings are not available.
       












               
       
       What You Should Know
       
    





            

The fund's market price is the last sale price as of the close of the regular market trading session. The fund's market price as of and after July 1, 2013, reflects the last sale price in the broad market; market price prior to July 1, 2013, reflects the last sale price on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their NAV. The fund’s cash available for distribution will vary over time, and there is no guarantee prior distribution levels will be maintained. If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made exceed the amount of the fund's earnings and profits as computed for federal tax purposes, the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital to holders of common shares (up to the amount of each shareholder’s basis in those shares) and thereafter as gain from the sale of common shares. Such return of capital reduces the shareholder’s adjusted basis for common shares, thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss of a subsequent sale. Distributions in any year may include a substantial return-of-capital component. An investment in the fund's common shares is subject to investment and market risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund, which generally are traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. These securities will fluctuate in value, and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment, even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. An issuer of securities held by the fund may default, have its credit rating downgraded, or otherwise perform poorly. The fund utilizes a Credit Facility Agreement (CFA) to increase its assets available for investment. Shareholders bear the fees associated with this leverage and may be disadvantaged from the use of leverage. It is important to recognize that use of leverage increases the advisor’s fee. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including:

the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares
the risk that the cost of utilizing the CFA will increase with rising interest rates
the risk of increased operating costs that can lower fund returns
the risk of a decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage, while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed
the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements

Fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage. If the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the CFA is terminated, the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time, incurring tax consequences, and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected.
Effective with the quarterly distribution payable on September 28, 2012, Financial Opportunities Fund (the Fund) declared its distribution pursuant to the Fund’s managed distribution plan (the BTO Plan). Under the current BTO Plan, the Fund makes quarterly distributions of an amount equal to $0.2961 per share, based upon an annual distribution rate of 6.50% of the Fund’s NAV of $18.22 on July 31, 2012 (representing a quarterly distribution rate of 1.625% of the Fund’s July 31, 2012, NAV). This amount will be paid quarterly until further notice.
Distributions under the BTO Plan may consist of net investment income, net realized long-term capital gains, net realized short-term capital gains and, to the extent necessary, return of capital. The BTO Plan intends to fund each distribution, to the extent possible, in a tax-advantaged manner through the realization of long-term capital gains where the distribution amount exceeds net investment income. The Fund will seek to realize capital gains for this purpose in a manner which the advisor and subadvisor believe is consistent with prudent portfolio management and the investment objective, policies, and guidelines of the Fund.
The Fund may also make additional distributions (i) for purposes of avoiding federal income tax on the Fund of investment company taxable income and net capital gain, if any, not included in such regular distributions and (ii) for purposes of avoiding federal excise tax of ordinary income and capital gain net income, if any, not included in such regular quarterly distributions. The Board may amend the terms of the BTO Plan or terminate the BTO Plan at any time.
Closed-end fund shares are not redeemable, but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. They frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Specialized funds may carry additional risks. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. Distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
