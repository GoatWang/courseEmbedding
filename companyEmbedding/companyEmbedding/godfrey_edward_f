Detailed item info
In his second adaptation of an Oscar Wilde play, writer-director Oliver Parker (AN IDEAL HUSBAND) assembles a peerless cast to engage in this witty comedy of manners and mistaken identity. In 1890s London, rakish Algernon Montcrieff (Rupert Everett, who also starred in HUSBAND) runs into his friend, Jack Worthing (Colin Firth), who is in town to propose marriage to Algy's wildly romantic cousin, Gwendolen (Frances O'Connor). When returning a cigarette case to Jack, Algy reads the inscription, and discovers his friend has two secrets. Jack has created a devilish younger brother/alter ego called "Ernest" to hide his own misdeeds, and has a beautiful young ward named Cecily (Reese Witherspoon), whom he wants to keep clear of the roguish Algy. While Jack deals with the large obstacle standing between him and Gwendolen--namely, her mother, the imposing Lady Bracknell (a wonderfully imperious Judi Dench)--Algy devises a way to meet Cecily. The confusion and hilarity come to a peak when Algy arrives at Jack's country manor posing as Ernest in order to woo Cecily, and Gwendolen runs away to the country to be with Jack--whom she knows as Ernest. The stellar cast and Wilde's clever words make for genuine entertainment.Product HighlightsVideo Trailer:Product DetailsNumber of Discs:1Rating:GFilm Country:USAUPC:031398137610Additional DetailsGenre:ComediesFormat:DVD"...Everett, whose scenes with Firth are a droll delight, nails every sly laugh.

Firefighter Heroism Quotes from History 










Firemen are going to get killed. When they join the 
				department they face that fact. When a man becomes a fireman his 
				greatest act of bravery has been accomplished. What he does after 
				that is all in the line of work. They were not thinking of getting 
				killed when they went where death lurked. They went there to put 
				the fire out, and got killed. Firefighters do not regard themselves 
				as heroes because they do what the business requires.
				
-- Chief Edward F. Croker, FDNY,speaking upon the death 
					of a deputy chief andfour firefighters in February of 1908

 
I have no ambition in this world but one, and that 
				is to be a firefighter The position may, in the eyes of some, appear 
				to be a lowly one; but we who know the work which the firefighter 
				has to do believe that his is a noble calling. There is an adage 
				which says that, "Nothing can be destroyed except by fire." We strive 
				to preserve from destruction the wealth of the world which is the 
				product of the industry of men, necessary for the comfort of both 
				the rich and the poor. We are defenders from fires of the art which 
				has beautified the world, the product of the genius of men and the 
				means of refinement of mankind. (But, above all; our proudest endeavor 
				is to save lives of men-the work of God Himself. Under the impulse 
				of such thoughts, the nobility of the occupation thrills us and 
				stimulates us to deeds of daring, even at the supreme sacrifice. 
				Such considerations may not strike the average mind, but they are 
				sufficient to fill to the limit our ambition in life and to make 
				us serve the general purpose of human society.

-- Chief Edward F. Croker FDNY circa 1910


Whatever the American's are proud of - whatever they 
				consider to be particularly good, useful, brilliant, or characteristic 
				of themselves or their climate, they designate, half in jest, though 
				scarcely half in earnest, as an institution. Thus the 
				memory of George Washington... is an institution; the Falls of Niagara 
				are an institution; the Plymouth Rock, on which the Pilgrim Fathers 
				first set foot, is an institution...; Sweet potatoes 
				are an institution, and Pumpkin (or Punkin) pie is an institution; 
				...squash is an institution; Bunker Hill is an institution; and 
				the firemen of New York are a great institution.

-- Life and Liberty in America by Charles Mackay, 
					published 1850


If Prometheus was worthy of the wrath of heaven for 
				kindling the first fire upon earth, how ought all the gods honor 
				the men who make it their professional business to put it out?

-- John Godfrey Saxe, (American journalist, poet, and lecturer) 
					circa 1850





					When fire is cried and danger is neigh,God and the 
					firemen is the people's cry;But when 'tis out. and 
					all things righted,God is forgotten and the firemen slighted.

-- printed in "The Fireman's Journal" October 18, 1879.







					ODE TO OUR FIREMENBy Frederic G. W. FennAll honor 
					to the red-clad heroes; the boys who ran the machineOver 
					the highway to rescue, quick to danger's scene;Where angry 
					flames devour the poor man's earthly store,Bidding to all 
					a defiance, with its wild and sullen roar,Tell me not 
					of the gallants who wear the helmets bright,Who boast of 
					their deeds of slaughter in some degrading fight;But sound 
					aloud the praises, and give the victor-crownTo our noble-hearted 
					Firemen, who fear not danger's frown.They of many a 
					conflict, with the haughty demon of flame,With the rising 
					sun of the morning, their gallant deeds proclaim.The signal 
					that strikes terror, to them is known full well;Forth to 
					do and dare they spring at the tap of the bell.Some 
					one's home is falling in the midnight solemn hour;Now the 
					heroic legion spring forth to show their power.Listen to 
					the rumble, as they clatter over the way;There's hope in 
					the sound as they speed onIn determined and gallant array.
Soon the fiery days will he over; the machine will be of 
					the past,And over the forms of our heroes the mantle of 
					age will be cast,And ere long they'll tread to the portals, 
					and view the setting sun,Then fall; arrayed in the glories 
					of the gallant deeds they've done.Grand honor! to such 
					brave brothers; let the shout sweep to the sky.Weave garlands 
					round their memories as the ages swiftly fly,Over each Fireman's 
					hallowed grave write with honor's pen:Here lieth one who 
					delighted to aid his fellow men.

-- Printed in The National Fireman's Journal February 
						9, 1878.






					THE MARTYRED FIREMANBy Frank J. OttarsonFold gently 
					o'er his silent breastThe honored badge he wore in death,
					And reverent lay to peaceful rest --With tearful eyes and 
					bated breath --The hero who nor shrunk nor quailedWhen 
					bravest hearts from terror failed,When "Backward!" from 
					the tottering wall --"Back for your lives !" was cried by 
					all.But he nor feared, nor saw, nor heard,He would not 
					hear the backward word;The path of duty lay before;The 
					fireman's badge he proudly woreWould blush for shame if 
					one should sayHe shrank from danger. "Clear the way!"
					Up to the front the hero cameTo battle face to face with 
					flame.One thought he gave to hearts at home,And eyes 
					that laughed to see him come;But "Duty, duty !" was the 
					cry --'Twas duty now to do or die,He dashed the unbidden 
					tear away,And foremost led the dangerous fray;The high 
					wall tottered all aflame:Then, like an avalanche, it came
					Down thundering to the quaking ground,And built the martyr's 
					funeral moundA shriek of horror! Like a flashTo work 
					his brave companions dash;With blistering hands they tear 
					the pile --Their hushed hearts beating low the while --
					And soon with streaming eyes they bearThe martyr to the 
					cool night airToo late! The fatal work is done!His crown 
					of fame is dearly won;Crushed by the cruel wall he lies,
					Stern duty's latest sacrifice.The victim of the battle's 
					strifeLives in our hearts a second life;But who the 
					unarmed hero knows,Who, like this fireman, graveward goes
					Contented, in a peaceful sphere --To live without reproach 
					or fear,To do all that becomes a man,And fill the grand 
					though humble planBy Heaven ordained? Shalt we forget
					The hero whose bruised body yetSeems quick with life? Let 
					banners waveO'er martyrs in a warrior's grave;Here needs 
					no muffled drum nor crepe;Our very hearts to-day we drape
					With sorrow, and sit down to mournThe hero who will ne'er 
					return.Lay him to rest; his work is o'er;Nor sins nor 
					sorrows vex him more;He filled the Maker's grandest plan,
					And when be died he died for man,
-- printed in "The Fireman's Journal" April 2, 1881.
