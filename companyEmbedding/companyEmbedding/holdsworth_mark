The Siena Corner Sofa

    Designed by
    
      Mark Holdsworth


























Dear Mark. I just wanted to say how pleased I am with the Siena corner sofa. It is beautifully made - really exceptional quality materials and craftsmanship. The delivery company was excellent as well.

Paul White, Cambridge (March 2013)



Available in many sizes, configurations and leathers/fabrics.  Exceptional quality.  We’ve cornered great design with the Siena – a stunning sofa and double chaise longue all rolled into one beautiful piece of corner furniture. As founder and MD of Iconic Interiors, I designed the Siena to compliment the designer beauty of the Iconic collection, but in a corner design that suits modern living.

With room for two on its lounging area, the Siena creates both an intimate corner for couples, and a large relaxation space for family and friends. Move the multi-sized cushions to suit your mood, and get everyone comfortable.
Sit with a glass of wine, or put your feet up and relax in the knowledge that the Siena corner sofa has classic looks and high-quality materials that will never go out of style. Displayed here in classic, distressed-brown leather, the Siena is available in our full range of Italian leather and fabric finishes.  Please also bear in mind there are many bespoke configurations available with the Siena corner sofa design.

Mark Holdsworth
Mark our words, Mark Holdsworth knows about iconic furniture design. As the founder of Iconic Interiors, Holdsworth has spent nearly a decade researching, sourcing and recreating some of the most famous furniture designs in history.
His first design – a three-seater corner sofa provisionally titled ‘the Siena’ – offers five-cornered comfort and Iconic’s renowned designer style.
The Siena brings contemporary Italian design to the Iconic collection, with a shape that suits 21st century living.

The Full Story
When I founded Iconic Interiors in 2005, I aimed to offer furniture with designer style and great functionality. Form and function – that’s what great design is all about. Years later, I believe the Iconic collection still offers style, together with comfort, body contouring and durability.
However, after nearly a decade of sourcing and commissioning designer furniture for Iconic, I knew something was missing from our collection – a truly unique corner sofa.  Corner sofas are ideal for modern living. They suit the shape of our homes, and our laid-back 21st century home life. A well-designed corner sofa offers comfort, relaxation and closeness – exactly what modern homes need.
I’ve spent many years searching for a model that will compliment the classic designs at Iconic, but found very few corner sofas that offered both form and function. So, as the MD and founder of Iconic Interiors, I decided to create an exclusive corner sofa for the Iconic collection.
A trip to Siena, Italy inspired me to start sketching, and by the time I returned to the UK, I had designs for a modern sofa shape that suits 21st century lifestyles. Named after its birthplace, the Siena combines classic design and high-end materials to create a thoroughly up-to-date relaxation space.
The Siena is a space for enjoying life with family and friends, or as a couple. The double chaise longue is a unique feature, offering a cosy corner for two to relax together, or for the family pet to curl up.
Everything about this sofa is comfortable – even the arms have thick cushions for lying or leaning against. Versatile cushions mean you can rearrange every part of the Siena into a shape that suits.
The Siena is a generous size, measuring 3m by 1.5m, making it ideal for larger or open-plan living areas. In a smaller space, the Siena will be all the furniture you need – easy chair, chaise longue and sofa all rolled into one. We may soon create a single-chaise longue design too, for smaller living areas – watch this space.
Finished in your choice of luxurious leather or fabric upholstery, the Siena is designed to both compliment and co-ordinate with your environment. This exclusive piece is only available at Iconic.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Bamberg Barcelona Chair

    Selected by
    
      Mark Holdsworth


























Hi Mark.  The Bamberg Barcelona chairs are here! They look stunning. We are very happy…Thanks! (See their photographs in our furniture blog).

Istvan, Budapest (Feb 2014)



The Bamberg Barcelona chair is an in-house Iconic Interiors project.  The idea came to me when I saw a photograph (see below) of one of the very early Barcelona chairs from 1931 which sold at auction for £56000 with Christies in 1986.  The chair looked very old but still beautiful.  More beautiful I thought than a new chair - which I think can look too pristine.  I often wonder how one of the first Barcelona chairs would have looked.  I imagine it would have looked a lot more edgy and rugged.

Having visited the Mies Van Der Rohe pavilion in Barcelona I was fascinated with the Barcelona chairs they had on show.  Again they had this very aged appearance.  Extremely lived in but still looking fantastic.  More details and photography can be viewed in our designer furniture blog.  Leather finishes can be found by scrolling down this page as well as much more information and photographs.

The Full Story
The photograph below was used by Christies Auction House in Holland in 1986.  It pictures one of the original Barcelona chairs designed by Mies Van Der Rohe.  The chair finally sold for a staggering £56000.  Astonishing.  This photograph and my visit to the Pavilion in Barcelona gave me the idea of creating a chair more akin to this early creations. 



I inspected the Barcelona chairs very carefully and noticed how coarse they were constructed.  This to me did not distract from the design one bit.  For me it enhanced the appearance.  One thing which struck me was the thickness and rawness of the leather straps.  The modern Barcelona chairs are arguably too clean, too perfect.


When I returned to my work shop in East Yorkshire I set about creating my homage to these early Barcelona chairs.  More information and photographs can be found in our designer furniture blog.  If you have any questions about the Bamberg Barcelona chair or any of our pieces please email me or call me on 01606 871 457.  I love talking about our furniture
