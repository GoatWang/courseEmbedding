Park Jaehyun























Research of Jaehyun Park


Research Interest
My research highlights exploring new interpretations of products, systems, and services, especially as they relate to the issue of human enterprise in design, technology, and innovation in Information Systems (IS) research. Thus, my research interest and contributions are condensed into four genres – (1) ICT-enabled  Innovations, (2) designer-user interaction, design thinking, and user experience (3) smart cities and smart tourism, and (4) social theories and qualitative research -- in the broader areas of innovation, information systems, and new product development research.

(1) ICT-enabled  Innovations
(2) designer-user interaction, design thinking, and user experience
(3) smart cities and smart tourism
(4) social theories and qualitative research

(1) ICT-enabled Innovations
	Traditionally, most researchers in innovation studies have concentrated on the following three areas: features of innovation, innovation ubiquity, and requirements of innovation. Although I defer to these prior researchers’ endeavors, I believe there remains research paucity,
in that prior efforts have failed to highlight the areas of design collaboration among different stakeholders
in that prior efforts have failed to highlight the areas of design collaboration among different stakeholders in the process of design and IT innovation. My research, on the other hand, addresses this gap. My approach to this issue is different in that I examine the relationships between human-interactions and a variety of types of design innovations in terms of a micro perspective in design routines. Based on these interests, I am conducting a qualitative study to identify characteristic sequences and patterns that occur in the design and IT innovation..
Dissertation
Title: PATTERNS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN DESIGNERS AND USERS
Committee: Richard J. Boland (Chair), Youngjin Yoo, Kalle Lyytinen, Fred Collapy, and John Paul Stephens
Summary: Despite more than 40 years of design process research, design researchers and practitioners continue to wrestle with the challenges of incorporating users in their design process. My dissertation explores patterns of interaction between designers and users in the design process. I studied designers’ practices of user interaction with a view toward generative designer-user interaction. My research includes three stages of progressively deeper qualitative research on designer / user interaction: (Stage 1) field studies of seven user centered design projects; (Stage 2) interviews with 40 designers collecting 59 project narratives of direct user interaction during a design project; and (Stage 3) interviews with 35 additional designers collecting 40 additional project narratives of co-creation with users in the design process. This research addresses theoretical, methodological, and practical gaps. My findings include proposing a theoretical framework to understand users’ roles in existing design methods and to theorize an expanded design vocabulary, which identifies two latent learning loops, based on Bourdieu’s theory of practice. This integrated model demonstrates how designers could explicitly communicate with users at three learning levels: bringing users into design, interacting with users, and co-creating with users in the design process.
