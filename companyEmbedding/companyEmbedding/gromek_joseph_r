The New School Appoints Joseph Gromek Board Chair | The New School News Releases



















 Joseph R. Gromek Elected to Lead Board of Trustees  
            at The New School 
  Fashion Industry Leader Lauded for Understanding the Role of Creativity  in the Economy 
 

















NEW  YORK, November 7, 2012 – The Board of Trustees at The  New School has announced that Joseph R. Gromek has been unanimously elected to serve as Board Chair, effective  immediately.
Gromek is an influential leader in the global apparel industry,  responsible for a complete turnaround at Warnaco Group, Inc., which he served  as President and CEO from 2003 until February 2012. Taking over as the company  emerged from Chapter 11, Gromek spearheaded Warnaco’s international expansion,  transforming it from a domestic apparel wholesaler into one of the world’s foremost retailers. 
Gromek became a Trustee at The New School in 2011, but began  playing a leadership role in 2005 when he was elected to the Board of Governors  of Parsons The New School for Design. Working with Parsons’ dean and faculty, Gromek leveraged  connections in the fashion industry to connect graduates to professional  opportunities and to increase support of The New School’s design-led  curriculum.
“The  New School occupies a singular place in today’s higher education landscape,”  Gromek said. “As a university with expertise in two distinct, but critically  related fields—design and the social sciences—The New School can educate a  generation of creative and civic leaders to meet the challenges of a new  economy.”
Gromek  takes the helm of The New School Board during a transformative  time for the 94-year-old university. David Van Zandt, who became its eighth  president in 2011, has expressed a vision for the future that optimizes  historic strengths in design and social sciences. The university is launching  new degree programs and interdisciplinary study options designed to equip  graduates for globalization, urbanization, and technological innovation.
“Joe’s  election as chair comes at an opportune moment because he values the innovative  characteristics of The New School,” Van Zandt said. “Joe understands the  non-traditional role we have played in the past and the clarity of vision  required to advance in the future. Our students and faculty creatively address  critical global issues, guided by a persistent commitment to social justice and  changing the status quo. This is a fundamental New School value and I am  confident Joe will lead the Board to sustain and support it.”
Among  the new programs recently launched at The New School is an MFA in Transdisciplinary  Design, which serves as a laboratory to  empower designers to face the challenges of a global society. Among its first  graduating class, one team of students won an Innovation and Design Award from Fast Company for their thesis project, “Softwalks,”  which refigures urban construction scaffolding into a community asset, and improves  life in the city in the process.
In  becoming Board Chair, Gromek succeeds Michael J. Johnston, who was elected  chair in 2009. Johnston presided over the search for President Van Zandt and  the Board’s approval of the University Center,  the largest construction project in New School history in the heart of downtown  Manhattan. When the University Center opens in Fall 2013, it will become the  anchor structure for the 10,000-student university. 
“As  higher education continues to evolve, The New School faces tremendous  opportunities,” Gromek said. “After more than a quarter century in retail, I  have insight into the demanding fields many New School students wish to enter. I  see my role helping prepare graduates withstand an unsteady economy with the  talent and mastery needed to succeed.”
About The New School
The New  School, a leading progressive university in New York City was founded in 1919  as a center of intellectual and artistic freedom. Today The New School is still  in the vanguard of innovation and experimentation in higher education, with  more than 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students in design and the social sciences,  liberal arts, management and public policy, the arts, and media, and in  hundreds of continuing education courses. Committed to public engagement, The  New School welcomes thousands of New Yorkers yearly to its celebrated public  programs and maintains a global presence through its online learning programs,  research institutes, and international partnerships.

Tumi Holdings, Inc., is a South Plainfield, New Jersey-based manufacturer of suitcases and bags for travel. Founded in 1975 by Charlie Clifford after a stint in the Peace Corps in Peru, the company is named after a Peruvian ceremonial knife used for sacrifices.[1] Tumi, Inc. was a unit of Doughty Hanson & Co. from 2004 until after its 2012 initial public offering.[2]
Tumi's products are known for their black-on-black ballistic nylon.[3] Tumi is available at department stores and specialty stores as well as over 120 Tumi stores and 200 shop in shops around the world.[4]
Tumi also supplies accessories such as belts, pens, and electronic equipment. The company teamed with designer Anish Kapoor in 2006 to produce the PowerPack Backpack that incorporated solar technology for charging phones and PDAs.[5] The company also had a licensing agreement with Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati, launching a collection of eight co-branded pieces in 2006 sold through both of the brands' retail outlets.[6]
Tumi puts a metal plate with a unique 20-digit registration number in each of its bags. Customers can register for the Tumi Tracer program to have their contact information entered into a central database so they can be reunited with their bag if it is found.[7]
In 2004, Doughty Hanson & Co, a London-based private equity firm, took over Tumi for $276M. The take over came with a price drop in their products and a change in warranty from their famed lifetime warranty to 5 years. Tumi have since failed to honour customers who paid the significantly higher rates for the lifetime warranty prior to 2004.[citation needed]
Jerome Griffith became the CEO of Tumi Inc. in 2009.[8]
On April 19, 2012, Tumi made an initial public offering of 18,779,865 shares, as Tumi Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: TUMI).[9] In December 2013, Joseph R. Gromek was named Chairperson of Board of Directors.[10]
On March 4, 2016, Samsonite announced it would acquire Tumi in an all-cash transaction worth US$1.8Bn[11]
