Timberland Bancorp, Inc. Added To Russell® 2000 Index






GlobeNewswire



Jul 5, 2017 4:00 PM EDT













 




























































 HOQUIAM, Wash., July 05, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Timberland Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:TSBK) ("Timberland" or the "Company"), the holding company for Timberland Bank (the "Bank") announced it was added to the Russell 3000  ®  Index and the Russell 2000  ®  Index when Russell investments reconstituted its comprehensive set of U.S. and global equity indexes on June 26, 2017.     "Being added to the Russell indexes is a milestone for Timberland, and we are happy to have earned this distinction," said Michael Sand, President and CEO of Timberland.  "Inclusion in these market benchmarks is expected to raise our profile with institutional investors and support trading of our shares." The Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for both index funds and as benchmarks for passive and active investment strategies.  In the U.S. marketplace, almost all of the U.S. equity assets are benchmarked by the Russell 3000, representing more than $8.5 trillion.  The Company will hold its membership until FTSE Russell reconstitutes its indexes in June 2018. Membership in the Russell indexes remains in place for one year and automatically provides inclusion in the appropriate Russell growth and value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for these indexes primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings. The annual reconstitution of the Russell 3000 captures the 3,000 largest U.S. stocks as of the end of May, ranking them by total market capitalization.  The largest 1,000 companies in this ranking comprise the Russell 1000 and the next 2,000 companies become the Russell 2000.  The Russell 2000 also serves as the U.S. component to the Russell Global Index, which Russell launched in 2007.  The new membership list for the Russell Indexes is available at https://www.ftserussell.com/index-series/index-resources/russell-reconstitution.   About the Company Timberland Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the holding company for Timberland Bank.  The Bank opened for business in 1915 and serves consumers and businesses across Grays Harbor, Thurston, Pierce, King, Kitsap and Lewis counties, Washington with a full range of lending and deposit services through its 22 branches (including its main office in Hoquiam).

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  16.22 (07/21/17)      EPS (TTM)  $1.59      Market Cap $189.60 M     Shares Outstanding 7.35 M     Public Float 6.10 M     Yield 1.71% (07/21/17)      Latest Dividend $0.11 (05/26/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 05/10/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    2.54      Net Money Flow ($)  126,051    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
