Below are selected financial highlights of the Company’s second quarter of 2017, compared to the first quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016.           Quarter ended   June 30, 2017  March 31, 2017   June 30, 2016                  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)  Net income available to common shareholders$1,593  $1,429  $1,256           Diluted income per common share$0.36  $0.32  $0.28   Common shares outstanding 4,374,725   4,374,725   4,367,018   Average common shares outstanding , diluted 4,426,411   4,420,023   4,420,484           Annualized return on average assets 0.85%   0.80%   0.75%   Annualized return on average equity 8.68%   8.12%   7.26%   Net interest margin 3.34%   3.34%   3.33%   Efficiency ratio 62.95%   64.74%   67.79%           Tangible common equity to tangible assets 9.75%   9.77%   10.30%   Tangible book value per common share$16.76  $16.34  $16.03   Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.47%   1.58%   2.07%           Select Quarterly Financial Data The following key issues contributed to the second quarter operating results as compared to the same quarter in 2016 and the financial condition results compared to December 31, 2016: Interest income – Total interest income increased $1,038,000 (17%) during the quarter.  The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $81,614,000 (13%), while the yield on average interest earning assets increased 12 basis points to 4.11%.  The Company experienced strong loan activity during the second quarter, in which loan balances increased $22.6 million. However, pricing on loans remains very competitive on new and renewing credits. This pricing pressure has impacted the ability to maintain loan yield compared to 2016.  The yield on loans declined 10 basis points to 4.45% for the second quarter when compared to the same quarter in 2016.    Interest expense - Total interest expense increased $325,000 (32%) during the quarter.  The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased $62,042,000 (11%), while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points to 0.90%.  To fund its asset growth going forward, the Company will continue to utilize a cost effective mix of retail and commercial deposits along with non-core, wholesale funding. Provision for loan loss expense and allowance for loan losses –Based on its reserve analysis and methodology, the Company recorded a provision for loan loss expense of $575,000 during the quarter, an increase from the $375,000 recognized during the prior year quarter.  The provision for the quarter was primarily due to the increased loan balances and increased reserves on a few small problem credits. At June 30, 2017, the allowance for loan losses of $6.6 million was 1.08% of gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale). Management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a sufficient level to provide for loan losses in the Bank’s existing loan portfolio. Non-interest income –Non-interest income increased $188,000 during the quarter compared to the same quarter in 2016 primarily due to the Company’s mortgage division experiencing another strong quarter resulting in an increase of $141,000 in gains on sales of fixed-rate mortgage loans.  The Company also had an increase of $42,000 in gains on sale of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans compared to the same quarter in 2016.  Non-interest expense – Non-interest expenses increased $259,000 over the prior year quarter.  This was primarily due to salaries and employee benefits increasing $229,000.  The Company’s recent expansion in the Joplin, Missouri market has created the need for additions of commercial and mortgage staff.  The Company has also experienced increases in other key areas of operations, technology and health/retirement benefits.  Provision for income taxes – The increase in the provision for income taxes for the quarter is a direct result of the Company’s increase in taxable income. Capital – At June 30, 2017, stockholders’ equity increased to $73.3 million compared to $70.0 million at December 31, 2016.  Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 exceeded dividends paid or declared by $2.1 million.  The equity portion of the Company’s unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and derivatives improved by $1.0 million at June 30, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016.  On a per common share basis, stockholders’ equity increased to $16.76 at June 30, 2017 as compared to $16.09 as of December 31, 2016. From a regulatory capital standpoint, all capital ratios for both the Company and the Bank remain strong and above regulatory requirements. Asset Quality – The Company’s nonperforming assets decreased to $11.0 million as of June 30, 2017 as compared to $11.3 million as of December 31, 2016. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 1.47% as of June 30, 2017 as compared to 1.64% as of December 31, 2016.  Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) Financial Measures In addition to the GAAP financial results presented in this press release, the Company presents non-GAAP financial measures discussed below.  These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance.  Additionally, Company management believes that this presentation enables meaningful comparison of financial performance in various periods.  However, the non-GAAP financial results presented should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP.  A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that the Company does expect to continue to recognize; the adjustments of these items should not be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.  Therefore, Company management believes that both GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together.  Operating IncomeOperating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts net income for the following non-operating items: Gains on sales of available-for-sale securitiesGains on sales of SBA loansGains and losses on foreclosed assets held for saleProvision for loan loss expenseProvision for income taxes A reconciliation of the Company’s net income to its operating income for the periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is set forth below.             Quarter ended Six months ended   June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016   (Dollar amounts are in thousands)            Net income$1,593  $1,256  $3,022  $2,532             Add back:         Provision for income taxes 521   416   1,024   944   Income before income taxes 2,114   1,672   4,046   3,476             Add back/(subtract):         Gains on investment securities (62)  (60)  (62)  (111)  Net loss (gains) on foreclosed assets held for sale 30   9   (8)  20   Gain on sale of SBA loans (125)  (83)  (255)  (152)  Provision for loan losses 575   375   1,050   750     418   241   725   507             Operating income$2,532  $1,913  $4,771  $3,983             About Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc.Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "we," "us," "our,"
or the "Company") is a Delaware-chartered corporation that was formed in
September 1997. The Company became a unitary savings and loan holding company
for Guaranty Federal Savings Bank, a federal savings bank (the "Bank") on
December 30, 1997, in connection with a plan of conversion and reorganization
involving the Bank and its then existing mutual holding company. The mutual
holding company structure had been created in April 1995 at which time more than
a majority of the shares of the Bank were issued to the mutual holding company
and the remaining shares were sold in a public offering. In connection with the
conversion and reorganization on December 30, 1997, the shares of the Bank held
by the mutual holding company were extinguished along with the mutual holding
company, and the shares of the Bank held by the public were exchanged for shares
of the Company.  ... More ...

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    
System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.
Time shown in Eastern Time unless otherwise specified.


The data contained herein from third party providers is obtained from what are considered reliable sources. However, it's accuracy, completeness, or reliability cannot be guaranteed. 


Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.

GlobeNewswire



Jun 23, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































 SPRINGFIELD, Mo., June 23, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc., (NASDAQ:GFED), the holding company (the "Company") for Guaranty Bank, today announces a dividend per common share of $.10 for its second quarter ending June 30, 2017.   The dividend will be payable on July 13, 2017 to stockholders of record on July 3, 2017.     About Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:GFED) has a subsidiary corporation offering full banking services.  The principal subsidiary, Guaranty Bank, is headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, and has nine full-service branches in Greene and Christian Counties and Loan Production Offices in Jasper and Webster Counties.   Guaranty Bank is a member of the MoneyPass and TransFund ATM networks which provide its customers surcharge free access to over 24,000 ATMs nationwide.  For more information visit the Guaranty Bank website: www.gbankmo.com.  The Company may from time to time make written or oral "forward-looking statements," including statements contained in the Company's filings with the SEC, in its reports to stockholders and in other communications by the Company, which are made in good faith by the Company pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "believes," "expects," and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.  These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of the Company's plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions, that are subject to change based on various important factors (some of which are beyond the Company's control). The following factors, among others, could cause the Company's financial performance to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements:   the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations;   the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, inflation, interest rates, market and monetary  fluctuations;   the timely development of and acceptance of new products and services and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and  quality compared to competitors' products and services;   the willingness of users to substitute competitors' products and services for our products and services;   our success in gaining regulatory approval of our products and services, when required;   the impact of changes in financial services laws and regulations (including laws concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance);   technological changes;   the ability to successfully manage and integrate any future acquisitions if and when our board of directors and management conclude any such acquisitions are appropriate;   changes in consumer spending and saving habits;   our success at managing the risks resulting from these factors; and   other factors set forth in reports and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time.
