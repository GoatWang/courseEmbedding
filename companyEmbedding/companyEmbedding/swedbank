Q&A: Swedbank broadens product offerings with clients in mind
 Visit LinkedIn ProfileSonja Luoma, 04 April 2013 












Earlier this year, Swedbank began to include capital-at-risk products in their product offerings for the mass market in Sweden. Nicole Pluntke (pictured), global head of structured products at Swedbank, shares some thoughts with SRP about the bank's new product strategy.
What are the reasons behind Swedbank's decision to include capital-at-risk structures in its offering for the mass market? We are always very focused on finding the best investment solutions for our clients and we see that this structure is a good instrument in a well diversified portfolio for Swedbank's clients.
We have very close cooperation and dialogue with our investment centre with the goal of jointly presenting a broad and attractive savings offering to our clients, where structured products are a natural part of our proposition. We have always had an extremely high focus on our clients and in finding the best solutions for them.
Do capital-at-risk products have traction among retail investors? Are sales volumes as expected, over expectation or below expectation? How are you expecting sales for these to develop over the coming year? We see a good demand for non-capital guaranteed products (NCGP) as well as for capital guaranteed structures. Last month, NCGP was the segment with the highest issued volume.
However, investors should look at their whole portfolio and ensure that they have a good diversification of their savings. As I said, we are working closely with Swedbank's investment centre as well as our economists to find the best possible saving solutions for our clients.
Last year was a great year for structured products at Swedbank and we issued bigger volumes compared to 2011. We have continued to see great demand for structured products from our clients during the first part of 2013, and our goals for structured products at Swedbank are to have the best client savings offering in the market and to be the natural choice for Swedish clients.
Are there any particular payoff structures that Swedbank is using in its capital-at-risk range? Will you be offering a variety of structures or rather stick to a specific type? We will limit the number of structures we offer to our retail clients, but still, we plan to add a couple of different types to our current offering (protected trackers/enhanced trackers). It is of the utmost importance that the adviser and the client understand how the structure works.
Is there a risk that these will be "eating" sales volume from your capital-protected offerings?  No, not really. When building a well diversified portfolio, you need different products so we see that there is a need for the capital-protected offering as well as for the NCGP.
A recent poll among Swedish providers on our website unveiled that the majority of providers think that capital-protected products will see the main increase in sales this year. How does this reflect on your strategy for your capital-at-risk offerings?Swedbank's market share for capital-protected products in the Swedish market is around one-third of the total volume and we think that this area will still be an important part of what we offer to our clients. However, we want to offer them a broader range of products and that is the reason why we now are offering the NCGP along with our capital-protected products.Swedbank is one of the main retail banks in Sweden but the bank also has home markets in the Baltics. Last year, the bank had the third largest market share in Sweden (excluding products in the flow and others section).The first capital-at-risk product launched by Swedbank in Sweden was Aktiebevis Airbag Sverige.

Currency Exchange Forward Transactions
Currency Exchange Swap Transactions
Foreign Exchange Options


A foreign exchange forward transaction means an agreement between two counterparties to exchange an agreed amount of one currency into other currency on a specific future date at the exchange rate agreed at the time entering into the transaction.
If your company has purchased or sold goods on terms of deferred payment, or needs to lock in the price for an extended period of time, then a foreign exchange forward transaction will protect the company’s income or expenses from exchange rate fluctuations, enable locking in of the product price or business profit, as well as allowing to avoid loss.Possibilities

keeping the company safe from unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations
locking in expenses and the bid price
agreeing the exchange rate on the day of the business transaction and having that exchange rate in force on the selected future date
planning the company’s total income and expenses irrespective of exchange rate fluctuations
Currency exchange transaction risks

the exchange rate agreed in the transaction remains in force until complete settlement of the transaction amount
at maturity, the exchange rate then prevailing on a specific market may be more favourable than the one agreed in the transaction
Collateral
The need for collateral is assessed on case-by-case basis and depends on the duration of transaction and currencies involved in the transaction.
Further information about this service is available by phone on 67 444 141.Requirements

Currency exchange swap transactions, or FX swap, are an effective cash management instrument. If your company expects settlements in one currency but has funds available in other currency, you can, until the necessary currency arrives in the account, borrow it in exchange for other currency not necessary at that time. The FX swap transaction does not do away with the need for the currency in question, however it helps to efficiently manage incoming and outgoing cash flows in different currencies.Possibilities

buying (selling) currencies at an agreed rate with an immediate settlement
reselling and repurchasing the same amount of currency on a future date at the rate agreed at the time of transaction

The exchange rates are set at the time of entering into transaction and are binding on both counterparties until completion of the transaction.Benefits of FX swaps

a chance to temporarily borrow the necessary currency until it arrives in the account against other currency available in the account and not needed at that time
a chance to keep the company safe from unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations and potential losses
a chance to move the maturity date of foreign exchange forwards or already existing forex swaps, or manage incoming and outgoing cash flows in different currencies
FX swap transaction risks

the exchange rate agreed in the transaction remains in force until complete settlement of the transaction amount
at maturity, the exchange rate then prevailing on a specific market may be more favourable than the one agreed in the transaction
Collateral
The need for collateral is assessed on case-by-case basis and depends on the duration of transaction and currencies involved in the transaction.

FX Option Types
Flexible forward
Risk reversal



Foreign exchange options, or FX options, are contracts which give your company the right, without an obligation, to exchange currency on a certain future date at the exchange rate and in the amount fixed at the time of entering into the transaction. Option transactions are entered into as a hedge against an unfavourable probable future event. The buyer pays the seller a premium to have such an opportunity.FX option types

Call option entitles the holder to buy the underlying currency at the rate fixed in the transaction, thus hedging against the risk of a rise in exchange rate.
Put option entitles the holder to sell the underlying currency at the rate fixed in the transaction, thus hedging against the risk of a fall in exchange rate.
Possibilities

keep the company safe from unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations and potential losses
benefit from favourable exchange rate fluctuations
locking in the maximum expenses and the bid price
select the ceiling or floor level of exchange rates
FX option transaction risks

the paid premium is not refunded if the option is not exercised during the period covered by the transaction
in case of early termination of the transaction, the customer may incur expenses or earn income, the size of which depends on forex market situation then prevailing
Collateral
The need for collateral is assessed on case-by-case basis and depends on the duration of transaction and currencies involved in the transaction.

Option transactions are entered into as a hedge against an unfavourable probable future event. Foreign exchange options, or FX options, are contracts where the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to exchange currency on a certain future date at the exchange rate and in the amount fixed at the time of entering into transaction. The seller of a forex option, in turn, incurs a contractual obligation to convert the currency at the exchange rate and in the amount agreed upon entry into the transaction within a specified future time period. The combination of buy and sell transactions allows to reduce or do away with premium payments.Situations where flexible forwards are recommended

if the company is willing to assume a risk known beforehand in return for the chance to exchange currency upon maturity at a better rate than the current forex forward rate
if the company wants to lock in a worse but still acceptable exchange rate in case the exchange rate develops differently than projected by the company
if the company expects no substantial improvements in the exchange rate as compared to the current market exchange rate
if the company is unwilling to pay or wants to reduce the premium payment as compared to those payable in case of forex options
Possibilities

keep the company safe from unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations and potential losses
benefit from favourable exchange rate fluctuations within a specified band
lock in the maximum expenses and the bid price
structure the transaction so as to avoid having to pay a premium at the time of entering into transaction
select the ceiling or floor level of exchange rates
Flexible forward transaction risks

the paid premium is not refunded if the option is not exercised during the period covered by the transaction
the chance to benefit from exchange rate fluctuations applies only up to a certain limit (barrier level); if the barrier level is reached, the exchange rate is fixed to the worst level initially selected by the company
in case of American style options, the barrier level rate is taken into account throughout the period of the option, whereas in case of European style options the barrier level rate is taken into account only at the option maturity date
in case of early termination of the transaction, the customer may incur expenses or earn income, the size of which depends on forex market situation then prevailing
