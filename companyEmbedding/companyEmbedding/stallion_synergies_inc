Stallion Synergies Inc (OTCPK:SSYR)
Current Ratio
=GURUF("OTCPK:SSYR","Current Ratio")

0.29 (As of Dec. 2015)
The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It is calculated as a company's Total Current Assets divides by its Total Current Liabilities. Stallion Synergies Inc's current ratio for the quarter that ended in Dec. 2015 was 0.29.

Stallion Synergies Inc has a current ratio of 0.29. It indicates that the company may have difficulty meeting its current obligations. Low values, however, do not indicate a critical problem. If Stallion Synergies Inc has good long-term prospects, it may be able to borrow against those prospects to meet current obligations.


Definition
The current ratio is mainly used to give an idea of the company's ability to pay back its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.
Stallion Synergies Inc's Current Ratio for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2015 is calculated as



Current Ratio (A: Dec. 2015 )=Total Current Assets (A: Dec. 2015 )/Total Current Liabilities (A: Dec. 2015 )


=0.01/0.034


=0.29



Stallion Synergies Inc's Current Ratio for the quarter that ended in Dec. 2015 is calculated as



Current Ratio (Q: Dec. 2015 )=Total Current Assets (Q: Dec. 2015 )/Total Current Liabilities (Q: Dec. 2015 )


=0.01/0.034


=0.29



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Explanation
The current ratio can give a sense of the efficiency of a company's operating cycle or its ability to turn its product into cash. Companies that have trouble getting paid on their receivables or have long inventory turnover can run into liquidity problems because they are unable to alleviate their obligations. Because business operations differ in each industry, it is always more useful to compare companies within the same industry.
Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry and are generally between 1 and 3 for healthy businesses.
The higher the current ratio, the more capable the company is of paying its obligations. A ratio under 1 suggests that the company would be unable to pay off its obligations if they came due at that point. While this shows the company is not in good financial health, it does not necessarily mean that it will go bankrupt - as there are many ways to access financing - but it is definitely not a good sign.
If all other things were equal, a creditor, who is expecting to be paid in the next 12 months, would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio means that the company is more likely to meet its liabilities which fall due in the next 12 months.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 5,000,000 shares offered at a
public offering price of $0.01 per share will vary depending upon the total
number of shares sold. Regardless of the number of shares sold, we expect to
incur offering expenses estimated at approximately $10,000 for legal,
accounting, and other costs in connection with this offering. The table below
shows the intended net proceeds from this offering we expect to receive for
scenarios where we sell various amounts of the shares. Since we are making this
offering without any minimum requirement, there is no guarantee that we will be
successful at selling any of the securities being offered in this
prospectus. Accordingly, the actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this
offering, if any, may differ.
 
                                  25%             50%             75%            100%     
Shares Sold                    1,250,000       2,500,000       3,750,000       5,000,000  
Gross Proceeds               $    12,500     $    25,000     $    37,500     $    50,000  
Less Offering Expenses (1)   $   (10,000 )   $   (10,000 )   $   (10,000 )   $   (10,000 )
Net Offering Proceeds        $     2,500     $    15,000     $    27,500     $    40,000  
 
In as much as our offering expenses are estimated to be $10,000, if we sell only
25% of the offering, we will likely have no funds for Operations and/or Sales
and Marketing, unless our actual Offering Expenses are less than the estimates
and/or payments are deferred. In that event, these numbers would essentially be
zero.


STALLION considers all paid market research companies as well as other market
research providers competitors. We will compete with many well-established
companies with online presence and our anticipated competitors include
baltimoreresearch.com, 2020research.com, surveyservice.com, focusgroup.com and
paidfocusgroup.co.uk. We compete directly with these competitors offering online
paid market research services and aggressive marketing by our competitors or the
entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our revenue and profit
margins. There is no certainty that we can deliver quality services to compete
with our competitors. However, we believe that the market is big and there are
prevailing opportunities for us to provide our services starting with the social
networking groups of our management team.

	·


	                 


	Entered into a letter of intent with a third party to acquire $10.8 billion in UPB of Ginnie Mae MSRs and expected to enter into an agreement with PMT relating to the sale of the excess servicing spread associated with this portfolio(1)




	 







	(1)  The pending transactions are subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, continuing due diligence, customary closing conditions, and approvals. There can be no assurance that the committed amount will ultimately be acquired or that either transaction will be completed.

	The third quarter was challenging for the mortgage industry, and the decline in origination volumes and reduced margins had a significant impact on PennyMac Financials loan production businesses, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stanford L. Kurland.  The decline in loan production was offset by growth in PennyMac Financials loan servicing and investment management businesses.  We reduced expenses, while remaining focused on executing against the initiatives that we believe will drive long-term growth.  I am particularly optimistic about the bulk MSR acquisitions which are expected to increase earnings and add scale to our loan servicing business, drive retail lending opportunities, and provide co-investment opportunities with PMT.

	Mortgage Banking Segment





	 




	PFSIs Mortgage Banking Segment consists of loan production, which includes retail lending and correspondent lending both for its own account and on behalf of PMT for which it provides fulfillment services, and loan servicing, which includes owned servicing rights and subservicing.




	 




	2














	 




	Mortgage Banking revenues were $72.9 million, a decrease of 22 percent from the second quarter, driven by a 39 percent decrease in gains on mortgage loans held for sale and a 17 percent decrease in fulfillment fees.  During the quarter, PFSIs loan production activity totaled $8.0 billion, of which $3.7 billion was fee-based fulfillment activity for PMT.  Net servicing income for the third quarter was $21.4 million, a decrease of 3 percent from the second quarter.




	 





	Loan Production





	 




	During the third quarter, PennyMac Financial originated and managed the acquisition of $4.3 billion in UPB of loans for its own account, and interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) totaled $4.1 billion, compared to $4.6 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, in the second quarter.  PFSI generated $25.9 million in net gains on mortgage loans acquired for sale in the third quarter, a 39 percent decrease from the second quarter.  The net gain on mortgage loans acquired for sale is detailed in the following table:

	PFSI performs fulfillment services for conventional conforming and jumbo loans acquired by PMT in its correspondent lending business.  These services include, but are not limited to, reviews of loan data, documentation and appraisals to assess loan quality and risk; the approval of correspondent sellers and monitoring of their ongoing performance; and the subsequent sale and securitization of loans in the secondary mortgage markets for PMT.  Fees earned from fulfillment of correspondent loans on behalf of PMT totaled $18.3 million in the third quarter, compared to $22.1 million in the second quarter, driven by decreased correspondent acquisitions by PMT in the third quarter.  The average fulfillment fee was 50 basis points during the third quarter.

	The total servicing portfolio reached $52.9 billion in UPB, an increase of 19 percent from June 30, 2013.  Of the total servicing portfolio at September 30, 2013, prime servicing was $46.8 billion in UPB and special servicing was $6.1 billion in UPB.  The Company subservices and services under contract $29.6 billion in UPB for its advised entities, an increase of 16 percent from June 30, 2013, due to correspondent acquisitions and distressed whole loan acquisitions by PMT.  PFSIs MSR portfolio grew to $23.0 billion in UPB, an increase of 25 percent over the prior quarter driven by its own correspondent acquisitions of government-insured loans and PFSIs retail lending activities.

	Investment Management Segment





	 




	PennyMac Financial earns a management fee and incentive compensation from its advised entities, which had combined net assets of approximately $2.1 billion as of September 30, 2013, up 14 percent from the second quarter.  Total revenue for the Investment Management segment was $14.3 million, up 6 percent from the second quarter.  Base management fees, incentive fees, and carried interest were unchanged quarter-over-quarter, with pretax income for the segment up 19 percent for the quarter due to reduced expenses.




	 





	Expenses





	 




	Expenses for the third quarter of 2013 totaled $52.3 million, a decrease of 7 percent from the second quarter, driven by lower compensation expense.  Compensation expense fell to $35.8 million, a 15 percent decline from the second quarter, reflecting the Companys focus on reducing expenses with the changing market environment.  Headcount reductions during and shortly after the third quarter totaled 186 employees, mainly in the companys correspondent and retail lending businesses.




	 




	PennyMac Financial continued to organically grow its servicing business through additions from loan production, and we expect the total servicing portfolio to grow by more than 40 percent in the fourth quarter with the two bulk MSR acquisitions, concluded Mr. Kurland.  Our investment management business continues to progress as PMT raised new capital and has deployed it across multiple investment opportunities.  As the mortgage origination market stabilizes, we expect to resume increasing market share and volumes in correspondent and retail lending.  While conditions in the mortgage industry are challenging, I believe PFSIs diversified business model is well positioned to drive substantial profitability and earnings growth over the long-term.

	period may vary materially from those projected herein, from past results
	discussed herein, or from illustrative examples provided herein. Factors
	which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results
	or those anticipated include, but are not limited to: changes in federal,

	industry in which we operate; lawsuits or governmental actions if we do not
	comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses; the
	creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and
	enforcement of its rules; changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored
	entities, their current roles or their guarantees or guidelines; changes to
	government mortgage modification programs; the licensing and operational
	requirements of states and other jurisdictions applicable to our businesses,
	to which our bank competitors are not subject; foreclosure delays and changes
	in foreclosure practices; certain banking regulations that may limit our
	business activities; changes in macroeconomic and U.S. residential real
	estate market conditions; difficulties in growing loan production volume;
	changes in prevailing interest rates; increases in loan delinquencies and
	defaults; our reliance on PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust as a significant
	source of financing for, and revenue related to, our correspondent lending
	business; availability of required additional capital and liquidity to support
	business growth; our obligation to indemnify third-party purchasers or
	repurchase loans that we originate, acquire or assist in with fulfillment;

	applicable to our investment management segment; conflicts of interest in
	allocating our services and investment opportunities among ourselves and our
	advised entities; the potential damage to our reputation and adverse impact
	to our business resulting from ongoing negative publicity; and our rapid
	growth. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement
	and should consider all of the uncertainties and risks described above, as
	well as those more fully discussed in reports and other documents filed by

	Home purchase demand is anticipated to remain robust, though some seasonal
	slowing is expected Slow economic growth and fiscal uncertainty have modestly
	tempered the outlook for future price appreciation Contracting origination
	market has led to tighter margins A smaller market results in higher barriers
	to entry for new entrants Emphasis on disciplined pricing, execution and
	service to maintain profitability Pipeline of distressed whole loan
	opportunities remains strong with additional sellers emerging  expected to
	remain strong through 2014 Home prices impact returns; expectation of continued
	price appreciation at a more moderate pace Alternatives to property
	resolution (e.g., modification, refinance) are increasingly important
	strategies to maximize returns Distressed Whole Loans Agencies dominate the

	UPB acquired on November 1, 2013; and the pending acquisition of $10.8
	billion in UPB. There can be no assurance that the pending transaction will
	be completed. Bulk MSR acquisitions add scale and help drive cost efficiencies
	over time Continued organic growth of prime servicing from loan production

	(non-portfolio) originations up 43% from 2Q13; comprised 57% of total retail
	originations Portfolio-sourced originations declined due to lower refinancing

	and subservicing of $8.4 billion in UPB from organic loan production
	activities Special servicing growth of over $1 billion in UPB from distressed
	loan acquisitions by PMT Continued to position the servicing platform for

	company New bulk MSR acquisitions grow prime servicing and are expected to
	drive cost efficiencies over time Servicing portfolio expected to exceed $75
