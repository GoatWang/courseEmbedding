Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

				Fraud warning			




Please be alert to fraudsters claiming to represent the Ashmore Group, one of its subsidiaries or its officers or employees.
Financial fraud is a global issue.
Criminals have become adept at creating plausible identities to defraud prospective investors. This includes the use of similar sounding email addresses, websites and fake profiles on social networking sites.
Please be aware that Ashmore does not cold-call investors to make investment offers, nor does it send unsolicited emails or letters.
If you have received contact from an organisation purporting to be connected to Ashmore or implying that Ashmore is its agent in any way, please contact us using the link to the left.
The Financial Conduct Authority provides advice with respect to investment scams: http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams
Current alerts
"Health Lottery UK" is not affiliated to the Ashmore Group.  We received reports in July and August 2016 that Ashmore Investment Limited was referenced in fraudulent letters informing recipients of a lottery win.
"Ashmore Wealth Funds" is not affiliated to the Ashmore Group.  Ashmore has worked with the relevant investigative authorities and has taken steps to stop the use of the Ashmore trade mark.
The Financial Conduct Authority has added a warning about Ashmore Wealth Funds to their website, which can be found at: http://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/ashmore-wealth-funds-clone
“Ashmore Property Group” is not a part of the Ashmore Group plc group of companies.  We believe that persons representing Ashmore Property Group may be falsely offering investment opportunities and claiming to be a part of the Ashmore Group.  It is our understanding that these attempts may be fraudulent and you may lose your money if you deal with these people.  Ashmore has reported this matter to the Financial Conduct Authority.

Ashmore Provides US Investors Access to Frontier Markets Through New Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund | Business Wire


























































Ashmore Provides US Investors Access to Frontier Markets Through New 
      Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund






November 07, 2013 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ashmore Investment Management Limited (Ashmore), one of the world’s 
      largest specialist managers of Emerging Markets (EM) debt and equity 
      securities, with assets under management of US$78.5 billion* today 
      announced the launch of the Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund (the Fund). 
      The Fund was launched on November 5, 2013 and offers both institutional 
      and retail share classes.
    

      Ashmore’s EM Frontier Equity Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation 
      by investing principally in equity securities and equity-related 
      investments of frontier market issuers. The Fund may invest in 
      securities denominated in any currency.
    

Commenting on the attractions of the Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund, 
      Ted Smith, Ashmore’s Head of US Intermediary Distribution, said:


      “Africa, the Middle East and other frontier markets have offered 
      excellent opportunities for investment growth, income, and portfolio 
      diversification for many years. Ashmore has been investing in frontier 
      markets since 1993 and has the global EM research capabilities and local 
      presence to effectively uncover the best opportunities for investors in 
      these markets. Through the Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund, US investors 
      can now take advantage of our long-term approach and deep resources to 
      gain access to these frontier market investment opportunities.”
    

Julie Dickson, Portfolio Manager, Equities at Ashmore, said of 
      Frontier Markets:


      “Investment opportunities in frontier markets continue to evolve. 
      Frontier markets are one of the least understood equity markets in the 
      world – they offer the potential for good value, sustainable, high 
      quality earnings growth and attractive dividends. Furthermore, frontier 
      market equity returns have low correlations to both emerging and 
      developed markets, and have lower volatility. By adding frontier market 
      equities to their portfolios, investors have the opportunity to 
      diversify their risks while accessing new sources of returns and income.”
    

      The Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund is registered with the U.S. 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the ‘1940 Act’ and will 
      be available through institutional and retail share classes.

About Ashmore


      Ashmore is one of the world's leading investment management groups 
      dedicated to Emerging Markets. The business was founded in 1992 as part 
      of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. In 1999, Ashmore became 
      independent and today manages US$78.5 billion (as at 30 September 2013) 
      in pooled funds, segregated accounts and structured products. Ashmore 
      focuses on a number of Emerging Markets investment themes including 
      external debt, local currency, corporate debt, blended debt, equity, 
      alternatives (special situations, infrastructure and real estate), 
      overlay / liquidity, and multi-strategy products.
    

      Ashmore Equities Investment Management (US) LLC serves as the 
      sub-advisor to the Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund.
    

      Ashmore Group plc (ASHM:LN) is listed on the London Stock Exchange and 
      is a member of the FTSE 250 Index. The company has significant employee 
      ownership. Ashmore is headquartered in London, England and has offices 
      in Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Singapore, 
      Turkey, and the United States.
    

      Ashmore Investment Management (US) Corp., a broker-dealer registered 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is the principal 
      underwriter and distributor of the Fund’s shares.
    

There can be no guarantee that any strategy (risk management or 
      otherwise) will be successful. All investing involves risk, including 
      potential loss of principal.


INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS: There can be no guarantee that any 
      strategy will be successful. All investing involves risk, including the 
      potential loss of principal. Certain risks related to an investment in 
      the Fund are summarized here. Equity Securities Risk: Equity 
      securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer’s financial 
      condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer; Frontier 
      Markets Risk: Frontier market countries are emerging market 
      countries, but generally have smaller economies or less mature capital 
      markets than more developed emerging markets, and, as a result, the 
      risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in 
      frontier countries. The markets of frontier countries typically have low 
      trading volumes and the potential for extreme price volatility and 
      illiquidity. This volatility may be further heightened by the actions of 
      a few major investors. For example, a substantial increase or decrease 
      in cash flows of mutual funds investing in these markets could 
      significantly affect local stock prices and, therefore, the net asset 
      value of Fund shares. These factors make investing in frontier countries 
      significantly riskier than in other countries, including other emerging 
      market countries, and any one of them could cause the net asset value of 
      the Fund’s shares to decline; Focused Investment Risk: Focusing a 
      fund’s investments in a limited number of issuers, sectors or industries 
      increases risk and the volatility of the value of a fund’s shares. The 
      Fund may be particularly susceptible to economic, political, regulatory 
      or other events affecting the issuers, sectors or industries to the 
      extent it focuses its investments; Liquidity Risk: Illiquid 
      securities and other instruments may be highly volatile, difficult to 
      value, and difficult to sell or close out at favorable prices or times.
    

Before investing you should carefully consider the Funds' 
      investment objectives, risk, charges, and expenses. This and other 
      information is in the prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained from: 
      Ashmore Investment Management (U.S.) Corp, 122 East 42nd St, Suite 5005, 
      New York, NY 10168, or by calling Northern Trust, the transfer agent, at 
      1-866-876-8294. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.


      This press release should not be considered a solicitation to buy or an 
      offer to sell shares of any investment in any jurisdiction where the 
      offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of 
      such jurisdiction.

Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
