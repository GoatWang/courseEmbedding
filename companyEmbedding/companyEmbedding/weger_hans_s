Hans J. Wegner




Hans J. Wegner is the undisputed master of Danish chair design. Wegner has designed countless chairs, many of which—such as the Hans Wegner Wishbone Chair, Wegner Wing Chair, and Wegner CH07 Shell Chair—are internationally recognized classics. Hans Wegner’s furniture unites form and function; in every design, he places the highest demands on comfort and ergonomics. To Wegner, a chair isn't just a piece of furniture, but a work of art made to support the human form. 
With a background as a skilled cabinet maker, Hans Wegner has a fondness for integrating wood into his chairs, and he has a special talent for using the characteristics of the material to create surprising, sculptural lines. The Danish word for design is “formgivning”, which translated literally means “giving shape”. When you see Hans J. Wegner’s furniture, you begin to understand the true meaning of the word.
