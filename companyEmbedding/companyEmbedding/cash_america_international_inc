Operations[edit]
In addition to operating pawn shops, the company also provides check-cashing services and short-term unsecured loans (commonly referred to as "payday loans") both through its pawn shops as well as in self-standing facilities.
History[edit]
Company was founded by Jack Daugherty in Irving, Texas in 1983 as a single pawnshop. The chain grew through rapid acquisitions finally being listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1990 (Symbol:CSH). Starting in 1995, it started its growth in brick and mortar stores through acquisitions in Sweden and UK. In 1998, it created the Cash America franchise system. In 2003, it merged with Cashland with a combined volume of 5 billion dollars in loans. In 2004 it sold its European brick and mortar store assets and bought the last independent chain stores in United States, Super Cash. In 2006 it purchased Enova Financial (CashNetUSA) to create an internet-based division, before spinning it off in 2014.
In 2008, the 500th store was opened along with expansion in Mexico with a majority stakeholder status in the second largest pawnshop chain, Prenda Fácil, in Mexico. In 2010, it acquired Maxit Financial.[2]
As of January 29, 2015, Cash America International, Inc. operated 943 total locations offering specialty financial services to consumers, which included 859 lending locations in 21 states in the United States primarily under the names “Cash America Pawn,” “SuperPawn,” “Cash America Payday Advance,” and “Cashland,” as well as 84 check-cashing centers (all of which are unconsolidated franchised check cashing centers) operating in 12 states in the United States under the name “Mr. Payroll.”[3]
On September 1, 2016 Cash First completed purchase of Cash America for $994 million to form a new merged company. The new company will allow each store to retain its branding and joint operations will be out of the Cash Advance corporate location.

Operations[edit]
In addition to operating pawn shops, the company also provides check-cashing services and short-term unsecured loans (commonly referred to as "payday loans") both through its pawn shops as well as in self-standing facilities.
History[edit]
Company was founded by Jack Daugherty in Irving, Texas in 1983 as a single pawnshop. The chain grew through rapid acquisitions finally being listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1990 (Symbol:CSH). Starting in 1995, it started its growth in brick and mortar stores through acquisitions in Sweden and UK. In 1998, it created the Cash America franchise system. In 2003, it merged with Cashland with a combined volume of 5 billion dollars in loans. In 2004 it sold its European brick and mortar store assets and bought the last independent chain stores in United States, Super Cash. In 2006 it purchased Enova Financial (CashNetUSA) to create an internet-based division, before spinning it off in 2014.
In 2008, the 500th store was opened along with expansion in Mexico with a majority stakeholder status in the second largest pawnshop chain, Prenda Fácil, in Mexico. In 2010, it acquired Maxit Financial.[2]
As of January 29, 2015, Cash America International, Inc. operated 943 total locations offering specialty financial services to consumers, which included 859 lending locations in 21 states in the United States primarily under the names “Cash America Pawn,” “SuperPawn,” “Cash America Payday Advance,” and “Cashland,” as well as 84 check-cashing centers (all of which are unconsolidated franchised check cashing centers) operating in 12 states in the United States under the name “Mr. Payroll.”[3]
On September 1, 2016 Cash First completed purchase of Cash America for $994 million to form a new merged company. The new company will allow each store to retain its branding and joint operations will be out of the Cash Advance corporate location.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
