(K/M) is a full-service law firm handling matters through our seven offices located throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware. Our dedication to the needs of our clients, coupled with a result-oriented philosophy and insistence upon integrity has fostered our growth from six attorneys in a single Pennsylvania office to more than fifty attorneys in four states at present. As a full service firm, K/M’s attorneys have experience and expertise across a broad spectrum of legal specialties, and our list of clients includes regional, national and international insurance companies, corporations and other business entities ranging in size from Fortune 100 companies to the smallest “mom and pop” organizations. K/M can not only deliver its expertise as a litigation partner to its clients, but also as a counselor and advisor. In short, we firmly subscribe to the theory that sometimes the best defense is a good offense, and, therefore, we look to work with our clients to proactively develop practices and procedures that will help them avoid litigation. When litigation arises, however, K/M’s attorneys are skilled and experienced such that we are able to devise and communicate the best course of action to represent our clients’ interests at the outset of the case, and then implement that plan to a successful resolution, regardless of whether that resolution comes at the negotiating table or in a courtroom. The firm endeavors to provide honest, responsive, creative, and personalized service to each of its clients, while maintaining the highest ethical and professional standards. Our philosophy is to provide superior, goal oriented representation at a reasonable cost. Most importantly, our principal goal in providing service to our clients is to listen to them and learn about their needs, and then provide for those needs.

Johno McBride returns to lead AVSC alpine team

Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club alum and former national ski team coach John "Johno" McBride has returned to his roots to serve as alpine head coach.
McBride, 49 and a second-generation Aspenite, comes to AVSC after a successful four-year stint coaching downhill and super-G skiers on the Canadian National Team. 
McBride worked in a similar capacity with the U.S. Ski Team during the 1990s.

 Bode's coach
 McBride is probably best known for his tenure as Bode Miller's coach during the two seasons (2005 and 2008) when Miller won the overall World Cup trophy.
Spending up to nine months on the road can take its toll, and McBride said this week that after the season's final World Cup speed races in Kvitfjell, Norway, "I just decided it was time to come home." 
Johno and his wife Sunni, who live in old Snowmass, have three children ages 6, 9 and 10.
AVSC Executive Director Mark Cole said he has tried to hire McBride for different roles during his tenure with the club but that the timing wasn't right, until now.
"I've seen Johno being a good match for our program for years and have tried to get him into various key positions. To see that being realized is very satisfying," Cole said.
Cole said the addition is a positive for AVSC.
"Johno has so much experience coaching at a high level," Cole said. "I'm looking forward to Johno bringing out the best in (the AVSC coaches)."

 Return engagement
 This is actually McBride's second time coaching for AVSC. 
Following a stint on the U.S. Development Team and later as a student-athlete at the University of Vermont, McBride worked with the then-Aspen Ski Club under former alpine director Shane Burton.
McBride's first assignment as AVSC's alpine head coach was working with about 20 athletes during a May 3-4 training camp on Aspen Mountain.
 "My goal for this program is to give kids opportunities and expertise so they can reach their potential as skiers," McBride said. "With these mountains, facilities and support of the community, we have the ability for these athletes to really flourish."
