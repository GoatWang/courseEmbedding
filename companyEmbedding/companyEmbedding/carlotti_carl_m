  Bauer joined National Fuel in 2001 after 10 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its predecessor. He earned a Bachelor of Science in accounting at Boston College. Bauer is a board member of the YMCA Buffalo Niagara, Audit Committee Chairman of the D'Youville College Board, a Finance Committee member of the Canisius High School Board and an Investment Committee member of the Diocese of Buffalo.   Carl M. Carlotti, currently Senior Vice President of National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation, the Utility segment of National Fuel Gas Company, has been named President of the Utility, succeeding Anna Marie Cellino who will retire effective Feb. 1, 2016.  "Carl has managed virtually every functional area of the Utility during his 30-plus years with the company," said Tanski. "Carl will continue our history of strong customer service and commitment to the safe, reliable delivery of low-cost, environmentally advantageous natural gas to our utility customers."  Carlotti joined the Company in 1985 and has been Senior Vice President of the Utility since December 2007 and head of the Utility's Pennsylvania Division since 1993. Carlotti holds a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Gannon University and a law degree from the University of Dayton School of Law. Currently, he serves as a board member for the Energy Association of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, and the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership.  "One of the underpinnings of National Fuel's ongoing success has been the depth, breadth, and collective knowledge of our talented leadership team and workforce. With these executive level changes, and the ongoing hard work and dedication of our more than 2,000 employees, we are well positioned to continue executing on our development strategy to the long-term benefit of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders," Tanski concluded.  National Fuel is an integrated energy company with more than $6 billion in assets invested in the following five operating segments: Exploration and Production, Pipeline and Storage, Gathering, Utility, and Energy Marketing. Additional information about National Fuel is available at www.nationalfuelgas.com.  Certain statements contained herein, including statements identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," "believes," "seeks," "will," "may" and similar expressions, and statements which are other than statements of historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. The Company's expectations, beliefs and projections contained herein are expressed in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that such expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. In addition to other factors, the following are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: factors affecting the Company's ability to successfully identify, drill for and produce economically viable natural gas and oil reserves, including among others geology, lease availability, title disputes, weather conditions, shortages, delays or unavailability of equipment and services required in drilling operations, insufficient gathering, processing and transportation capacity, the need to obtain governmental approvals and permits, and compliance with environmental laws and regulations; impairments under the SEC's full cost ceiling test for natural gas and oil reserves; changes in the price of natural gas or oil; changes in laws, regulations or judicial interpretations to which the Company is subject, including those involving derivatives, taxes, safety, employment, climate change, other environmental matters, real property, and exploration and production activities such as hydraulic fracturing; governmental/regulatory actions, initiatives and proceedings, including those involving rate cases (which address, among other things, target rates of return, rate design and retained natural gas), environmental/safety requirements, affiliate relationships, industry structure, and franchise renewal; changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil sold at different geographic locations, and the effect of such changes on commodity production, revenues and demand for pipeline transportation capacity to or from such locations; other changes in price differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil having different quality, heating value, hydrocarbon mix or delivery date; financial and economic conditions, including the availability of credit, and occurrences affecting the Company's ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments, including any downgrades in the Company's credit ratings and changes in interest rates and other capital market conditions; the cost and effects of legal and administrative claims against the Company or activist shareholder campaigns to effect changes at the Company; uncertainty of oil and gas reserve estimates; significant differences between the Company's projected and actual production levels for natural gas or oil; delays or changes in costs or plans with respect to Company projects or related projects of other companies, including difficulties or delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, permits or orders or in obtaining the cooperation of interconnecting facility operators; changes in demographic patterns and weather conditions; changes in the availability, price or accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments; changes in economic conditions, including global, national or regional recessions, and their effect on the demand for, and customers' ability to pay for, the Company's products and services; the creditworthiness or performance of the Company's key suppliers, customers and counterparties; economic disruptions or uninsured losses resulting from major accidents, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist activities, acts of war, cyber attacks or pest infestation; or significant differences between the Company's projected and actual capital expenditures and operating expenses. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date thereof.

Carl M Carlotti's Experience
Title: Senior Vice President
               Company: National Fuel Gas Company
Job Details
               With nearly 2,000 employees in the communities where we operate, National Fuel is a leader in practicing the highest standards of responsibility in all aspects of its business. We are committed to providing safe and reliable natural gas delivery, excellent customer service, responsible environmental stewardship and productive community involvement. As an integral part of the communities that we serve, National Fuel recognizes the importance of charitable giving. Since 2005, National Fuel, its employees and Foundation have given more than $9 million to nearly 800 charitable organizations throughout the U.S. In 2004, the National Fuel Gas Company Foundation formed to better establish the Company's commitment to the community. As such, we strive to fund innovative programs, initiatives and, on rare occasions, special events, that fall within the pillars of National Fuel's community giving policies, and promise to advance strong, vibrant and stable communities. These pillars, or focus areas, include: Veteran services, education, community vitality/economic impact and the underserved/economically disadvantaged. In 2005, the Employee Charitable Giving Program formed to better align the Company's charitable support with the wishes of our employees. This program is similar to a matching gift program. Employees may choose to designate funds towards 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations and the Foundation will match those funds up to an annual dollar limit. Since the start of the program, employees and the Foundation have contributed more than $7 million. Our Company, its Foundation and employees are proud of our record of generosity through both charitable contributions and volunteer activities in all of the places where we do business. We are proud of the fact that our giving continues to increase. In 2014, employees pledges increased from the previous year, and more than half of the Company's employees elected to participate in the program, pledging more than half a million dollars. Outside of the Employee Charitable Giving Program, the Foundation and National Fuel Gas Company has given more than $3 million to local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations since 2005. The National Fuel Gas Company Foundation is a 501(c)(3) private foundation funded entirely by the shareholders of National Fuel Gas Company.
