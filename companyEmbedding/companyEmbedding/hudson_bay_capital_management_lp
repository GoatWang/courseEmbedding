NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hudson Bay Capital Management LP, a New York-based investment manager, 
      and its affiliated investment funds (collectively “Hudson Bay”), which 
      beneficially own approximately 3.4% of the common stock of Sabra Health 
      Care REIT, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBRA) (“Sabra”), today released an in-depth 
      presentation to SBRA shareholders highlighting why Sabra’s proposed 
      acquisition of Care Capital Properties, Inc. (NYSE:CCP) (“CCP”) is a 
      disastrous proposition and the need for SBRA shareholders to reject it. 
      A special meeting to vote on the proposed merger is scheduled to be held 
      August 15, 2017.
    

      The presentation highlights:
    


        How SBRA shares have significantly 
        underperformed the market by ~20% since SBRA announced its 
        proposed acquisition of CCP on May 7;
      

        The extent to which SBRA overpaid for CCP’s 
        assets by up to 30%+;
      

        SBRA’s track record of poorly thought through 
        acquisitions;
      

        How SBRA’s rationale for the deal is not
aligned with reality and not
in the best interests of SBRA shareholders;
      

        The extent to which SBRA’s share price could 
        significantly increase to ~$28 per share, an over 20% 
        premium to current levels of $23.45, absent the merger agreement with 
        CCP; and
      

        How SBRA shareholders could greatly benefit 
        from rejecting the proposed CCP acquisition.
      




           
        




We urge stockholders to vote “AGAINST” 
            the CCP Acquisition at the Special Meeting on the Company’s proxy 
            card. This is not a solicitation of authority to vote your 
            proxy. Please do not send us your proxy card; we are not able to 
            vote your proxies nor does this communication contemplate such an 
            event.

In 2005, assisted by certain key employees of GAM, Mr. Gerber founded Hudson Bay which absorbed GAM's business and 15 employees.
Prior to becoming a member of the American Stock Exchange, Mr. Gerber was an Associate Consultant at Bain and Company, a leading strategic management consulting firm, where he assisted the senior management of multinational corporations to identify and implement corporate growth opportunities. Mr. Gerber graduated Cum Laude from the University of Pennsylvania, with a BSE in Finance from Wharton and a BA in Humanistic Philosophy from the College of Arts and Sciences.
Mr. Gerber is a member of the Council of Foreign Relations and The New York Economic Club.

Professional

                                    Current                


Hudson Bay Capital Management LP


                  Hudson Bay Capital Management LP is a manager of alternative investment opportunities in the global markets targeting traditional and non-traditional sources of alpha by employing a diverse set of catalyst-driven absolute return strategies that are intended to be uncorrelated to each other and to the major indices. Our eight portfolio teams invest across the corporate capital structure and often trade around or in conjunction with an event or catalyst in an effort to exploit market inefficiencies.

Founded in December 2005, with Sander Gerber as Chief Investment Officer, the firm has 51 employees, including 26 investment/risk professionals, who seek to achieve persistently positive returns while maintaining a focus on risk management and capital preservation.                




Senior Vice President, Marketing

                                    Prior - 2015                


ICE Canyon LLC


                  ICE Canyon seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted absolute returns and long-term value from specialist strategies in emerging markets (EM) and global credit investment strategies. The firm's strategies cover all sectors of the EM fixed income and global credit universe including: EM sovereign, EM local currency, EM corporate credit, EM bank loans, EM special situations, EM distressed, and other global credit opportunities. ICE Canyon’s investment philosophy aligns long-term value creation in global investing to the primary forces of global economic growth, corporate earnings, and new market opportunities. ICE Canton employs an integrated, bottom-up, research-driven, value-seeking investment approach using probabilistic scenario analysis as the basis for decision-making and asset allocation. Their investment approach is designed to identify and exploit asymmetrical market opportunities in which the risk of any permanent loss of capital is well contained and the investment strategy is positively linked to significant upside catalysts. ICE Canyon’s investment strategy targets core value, deep value, and event-driven investment opportunities.                




Head of Institutional Sales

                                    2010 - 2012                


Gotham Asset Management LLC


                  Gotham Asset Management, LLC is an equity management firm that offers domestic and international value investing strategies to institutional clients. Joel Greenblatt and Robert Goldstein serve as Managing Principals and co-CIOs for Gotham, with over 50 years of combined investment experience.

Gotham Asset Management uses a fundamental value discipline developed by Greenblatt, Goldstein and their team of investment professionals to manage both long only and long/short equity portfolios.

        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
