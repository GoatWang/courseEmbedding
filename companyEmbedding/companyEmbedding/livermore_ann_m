Life and career[edit]





This section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification. Please help by adding reliable sources. Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous or harmful. (September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Early life[edit]
Livermore was born in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was the valedictorian at her North Carolina high school.[citation needed] She holds a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was a Morehead Scholar, as well as an MBA from Stanford University.[citation needed]
Hewlett-Packard[edit]
Livermore came to HP[when?] right out of graduate school. Livermore has been at HP since 1982 and has worked in a variety of sales, marketing, and research and development jobs before being elected a corporate vice president in 1995.[citation needed]
In 1997, Livermore was elected to the board of directors of United Parcel Service.[citation needed]
In 1998, when head of HP's software and services business, the company's top executives agreed to put themselves through a 360-degree evaluation. Livermore observed:

"I learned that I'm a very, very well-controlled executive, but that my employees like when I go off the handle every once in a while, you know, show my human side - It reinforced that leadership means touching people's hearts as well as their brains, so since then I haven't worried so much about keeping my lid on."[citation needed]

Livermore has been credited with steering HP away from its decentralized culture and hardware mentality and was the brains behind HP's E-services strategy.[3] When HP CEO Lewis Platt announced in March 1999 that he would step down, Livermore confirmed that she wanted the job. Insiders say Livermore was the only internal candidate who made the short list, but, in July 1999, HP made the former Lucent Technologies executive Carly Fiorina the first female CEO of a Dow 30 company.[4]
Since 2004, Livermore has led HP's Technology Solutions Group (renamed HP Enterprise Business in 2009), a US$30 billion-plus business that encompasses storage and servers, software and services. The products and services from this organization serve HP's business customers of all sizes in more than 170 countries. Once thought of as a costly distraction, this group is now seen as a source of future growth. Livermore's name was mentioned as a possible candidate to take over at HP when Carly Fiorina was ousted in February 2005 as CEO. Mark Hurd from NCR Corp. was instead picked to be HP's new CEO.[5]
In 2008, Ann Livermore's reported compensation was reported to be $20,551,493. In the same year, Mark Hurd as CEO reported his compensation to be $42,514,524.[6]
On May 13, 2008, Hewlett-Packard Co. confirmed that it had reached a deal with Electronic Data Systems to acquire the company for $13.9 Billion. The deal was completed on August 26, 2008. EDS became an HP business unit and was renamed EDS, an HP company. Ronald A. Rittenmeyer remained at the helm, reporting to Ann Livermore until his retirement.[citation needed]
With Mark Hurd's August 2010 departure, Livermore was once again a possible candidate for the top job however lost out to former SAP CEO, Léo Apotheker.[citation needed]
Livermore was named in Fortune and Forbes annual ranking of America's leading businesswomen.[7][8] As of 2011, her business unit was $60 billion which was half of total HP revenues and encompassed two-thirds of total HP staff.[2]
In the wake of HP pressuring employees to accept a 5% pay cut, it was revealed that Livermore's 2008 total compensation amounted to $20,551,493.[9]
On June 14, 2011, Livermore was replaced as head of HP Enterprises, as her top lieutenants, Dave Donatelli, software head Bill Veghte, and global sales leader Jan Zadak, were to report directly to the CEO. She was reported forced out since total services revenue had grown just 1% in the most recent fiscal year, despite the earlier acquisition of EDS in 2008.[2]
Personal life[edit]

In 2005 Livermore had a kidney transplant for an undisclosed ailment.[10]

Ann Martinelli Livermore (born 23 August 1958) was formerly an Executive Vice President at Hewlett-Packard, where from 2004 until June 14, 2011 she led the HP Enterprise Business business unit of HP. After being relieved of day-to-day operations, she was elected to board of directors of HP.[1] At the time, she was a 29-year veteran of the company and among existing senior management, the longest-service executive.[2]

Life and career[edit]





This section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification. Please help by adding reliable sources. Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous or harmful. (September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Early life[edit]
Livermore was born in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was the valedictorian at her North Carolina high school.[citation needed] She holds a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was a Morehead Scholar, as well as an MBA from Stanford University.[citation needed]
Hewlett-Packard[edit]
Livermore came to HP[when?] right out of graduate school. Livermore has been at HP since 1982 and has worked in a variety of sales, marketing, and research and development jobs before being elected a corporate vice president in 1995.[citation needed]
In 1997, Livermore was elected to the board of directors of United Parcel Service.[citation needed]
In 1998, when head of HP's software and services business, the company's top executives agreed to put themselves through a 360-degree evaluation. Livermore observed:

"I learned that I'm a very, very well-controlled executive, but that my employees like when I go off the handle every once in a while, you know, show my human side - It reinforced that leadership means touching people's hearts as well as their brains, so since then I haven't worried so much about keeping my lid on."[citation needed]

Livermore has been credited with steering HP away from its decentralized culture and hardware mentality and was the brains behind HP's E-services strategy.[3] When HP CEO Lewis Platt announced in March 1999 that he would step down, Livermore confirmed that she wanted the job. Insiders say Livermore was the only internal candidate who made the short list, but, in July 1999, HP made the former Lucent Technologies executive Carly Fiorina the first female CEO of a Dow 30 company.[4]
Since 2004, Livermore has led HP's Technology Solutions Group (renamed HP Enterprise Business in 2009), a US$30 billion-plus business that encompasses storage and servers, software and services. The products and services from this organization serve HP's business customers of all sizes in more than 170 countries. Once thought of as a costly distraction, this group is now seen as a source of future growth. Livermore's name was mentioned as a possible candidate to take over at HP when Carly Fiorina was ousted in February 2005 as CEO. Mark Hurd from NCR Corp. was instead picked to be HP's new CEO.[5]
In 2008, Ann Livermore's reported compensation was reported to be $20,551,493. In the same year, Mark Hurd as CEO reported his compensation to be $42,514,524.[6]
On May 13, 2008, Hewlett-Packard Co. confirmed that it had reached a deal with Electronic Data Systems to acquire the company for $13.9 Billion. The deal was completed on August 26, 2008. EDS became an HP business unit and was renamed EDS, an HP company. Ronald A. Rittenmeyer remained at the helm, reporting to Ann Livermore until his retirement.[citation needed]
With Mark Hurd's August 2010 departure, Livermore was once again a possible candidate for the top job however lost out to former SAP CEO, Léo Apotheker.[citation needed]
Livermore was named in Fortune and Forbes annual ranking of America's leading businesswomen.[7][8] As of 2011, her business unit was $60 billion which was half of total HP revenues and encompassed two-thirds of total HP staff.[2]
In the wake of HP pressuring employees to accept a 5% pay cut, it was revealed that Livermore's 2008 total compensation amounted to $20,551,493.[9]
On June 14, 2011, Livermore was replaced as head of HP Enterprises, as her top lieutenants, Dave Donatelli, software head Bill Veghte, and global sales leader Jan Zadak, were to report directly to the CEO. She was reported forced out since total services revenue had grown just 1% in the most recent fiscal year, despite the earlier acquisition of EDS in 2008.[2]
Personal life[edit]

In 2005 Livermore had a kidney transplant for an undisclosed ailment.[10]

Life and career[edit]





This section of a biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification. Please help by adding reliable sources. Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous or harmful. (September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Early life[edit]
Livermore was born in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was the valedictorian at her North Carolina high school.[citation needed] She holds a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she was a Morehead Scholar, as well as an MBA from Stanford University.[citation needed]
Hewlett-Packard[edit]
Livermore came to HP[when?] right out of graduate school. Livermore has been at HP since 1982 and has worked in a variety of sales, marketing, and research and development jobs before being elected a corporate vice president in 1995.[citation needed]
In 1997, Livermore was elected to the board of directors of United Parcel Service.[citation needed]
In 1998, when head of HP's software and services business, the company's top executives agreed to put themselves through a 360-degree evaluation. Livermore observed:

"I learned that I'm a very, very well-controlled executive, but that my employees like when I go off the handle every once in a while, you know, show my human side - It reinforced that leadership means touching people's hearts as well as their brains, so since then I haven't worried so much about keeping my lid on."[citation needed]

Livermore has been credited with steering HP away from its decentralized culture and hardware mentality and was the brains behind HP's E-services strategy.[3] When HP CEO Lewis Platt announced in March 1999 that he would step down, Livermore confirmed that she wanted the job. Insiders say Livermore was the only internal candidate who made the short list, but, in July 1999, HP made the former Lucent Technologies executive Carly Fiorina the first female CEO of a Dow 30 company.[4]
Since 2004, Livermore has led HP's Technology Solutions Group (renamed HP Enterprise Business in 2009), a US$30 billion-plus business that encompasses storage and servers, software and services. The products and services from this organization serve HP's business customers of all sizes in more than 170 countries. Once thought of as a costly distraction, this group is now seen as a source of future growth. Livermore's name was mentioned as a possible candidate to take over at HP when Carly Fiorina was ousted in February 2005 as CEO. Mark Hurd from NCR Corp. was instead picked to be HP's new CEO.[5]
In 2008, Ann Livermore's reported compensation was reported to be $20,551,493. In the same year, Mark Hurd as CEO reported his compensation to be $42,514,524.[6]
On May 13, 2008, Hewlett-Packard Co. confirmed that it had reached a deal with Electronic Data Systems to acquire the company for $13.9 Billion. The deal was completed on August 26, 2008. EDS became an HP business unit and was renamed EDS, an HP company. Ronald A. Rittenmeyer remained at the helm, reporting to Ann Livermore until his retirement.[citation needed]
With Mark Hurd's August 2010 departure, Livermore was once again a possible candidate for the top job however lost out to former SAP CEO, Léo Apotheker.[citation needed]
Livermore was named in Fortune and Forbes annual ranking of America's leading businesswomen.[7][8] As of 2011, her business unit was $60 billion which was half of total HP revenues and encompassed two-thirds of total HP staff.[2]
In the wake of HP pressuring employees to accept a 5% pay cut, it was revealed that Livermore's 2008 total compensation amounted to $20,551,493.[9]
On June 14, 2011, Livermore was replaced as head of HP Enterprises, as her top lieutenants, Dave Donatelli, software head Bill Veghte, and global sales leader Jan Zadak, were to report directly to the CEO. She was reported forced out since total services revenue had grown just 1% in the most recent fiscal year, despite the earlier acquisition of EDS in 2008.[2]
Personal life[edit]

In 2005 Livermore had a kidney transplant for an undisclosed ailment.[10]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
