Evanston Capital Management launches new registered fund

Articles and Features











Evanston Capital Management has launched the Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund, a closed-end, non-exchange listed, management investment company registered under Investment Company Act of 1940.
The fund commenced operations on 1 July. The fund is available to US accredited investors, including ERISA accounts, has an initial minimum investment of USD50,000 and offers Form 1099 tax reporting.
 
Evanston Capital Management has historically offered private funds-of-hedge funds available solely to qualified purchasers. The fund is intended to complement these private vehicles and has a similar strategy to Evanston Capital Management’s flagship fund-of-hedge funds that was launched in 2002.
 
The fund seeks attractive long-term risk adjusted returns and seeks to achieve its objective by investing substantially all its assets in underlying hedge funds, many of which seek to achieve their investment objectives with minimal correlation with traditional equity or fixed income indices. As of 1 July 2014, the fund has exposure to the following strategies: long/short equity, relative value, event driven, and global asset allocation.
 
“We’ve received many requests over the years for funds accessible to a wider range of investors,” says Adam Blitz, principal, CEO and CIO of Evanston Capital Management. “We are very pleased to launch the Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund and to offer Evanston Capital Management’s first registered version of our fund-of-hedge fund strategies to accredited investors. As with our private offerings, we will apply our extensive experience in hedge fund selection, portfolio construction, operations and risk management as we strive to realise attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns for the fund’s investors.”

Applicants’ Representations
1. The Fund is a Delaware statutory
trust that is registered under the Act as
a non-diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The
Fund’s primary investment objective is
to seek attractive long-term risk adjusted
returns. The Fund is a ‘‘fund of funds’’
and seeks to achieve its objective by
investing substantially all of its assets in
investment vehicles, often referred to as
‘‘hedge funds,’’ that are managed by
independent investment managers.
2. The Adviser is a Delaware limited
liability company and is registered as an
investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The

Federal Register / Vol. 79, No. 182 / Friday, September 19, 2014 / Notices

Adviser serves as investment adviser to
the Fund.
3. The Fund currently issues a single
class of Shares (‘‘Initial Class’’). The
Shares are continuously offered and are
registered under the Securities Act of
1933. Shares of the Fund are not listed
on any securities exchange, nor quoted
on any quotation medium. The Shares
are not offered or traded on a secondary
market. In order to provide a limited
degree of liquidity, the Fund may from
time to time offer to repurchase Shares
at their then-current net asset value
pursuant to Rule 13e–4 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(‘‘Exchange Act’’). Repurchases will be
made at such times, in such amounts
and on such terms as may be
determined by the Fund’s board of
directors (‘‘Board’’) in its sole
discretion. The Adviser expects to
recommend ordinarily that the Board
authorize the Fund to offer to
repurchase Shares from shareholders
quarterly.
4. The Fund’s Initial Class is subject
to a sales load, but is not subject to any
service or distribution fee. Shareholders
of the Initial Class are subject to a
repurchase fee if the interval between
the date of purchase of the Shares and
the valuation date with respect to the
repurchase of Shares is less than one
year.
5. The Applicants seek an order to
permit the Fund to issue multiple
classes of Shares, with varying sales
loads and asset-based service and/or
asset-based distribution fees. Applicants
request that the order also apply to any
other continuously-offered registered
closed-end management investment
company existing now or in the future
for which the Adviser or any entity
controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with the Adviser, acts
as investment adviser, and which
provides periodic liquidity to its Shares
pursuant to Rule 13e–4 under the
Exchange Act (together with the Fund,
the ‘‘Funds’’).1
6. If the requested relief is granted, the
Fund intends to offer multiple classes of
Shares of the Fund. Each class would be
offered at net asset value. Because of
different class expenses, the net income
attributable to, and any dividends
payable on, each class of Shares may
differ from each other from time to time.
As a result, the net asset value per Share
of the classes may differ over time.
1 Any Fund relying on this relief in the future will
do so in a manner consistent with the terms and
conditions of the application. Applicants represent
that each entity presently intending to rely on the
requested relief is listed in the application as an
Applicant.

Jkt 232001

7. Applicants represent that each new
class of Shares may charge a front-end
sales load and an annual asset-based
service and/or distribution fee.
Applicants further represent that any
distribution fee would be paid pursuant
to a plan of distribution adopted by the
Fund in compliance with the provisions
of Rules 12b–1 and 17d–3 under the Act
as if those rules applied to closed-end
management investment companies. In
addition, any asset-based service fee and
distribution fee for each class of Shares
will comply with the provisions of
NASD Rule 2830 (‘‘NASD Sales Charge
Rule’’).2 Any repurchase fee will apply
equally to all shareholders of the Fund,
regardless of the class, consistent with
Section 18 of the Act and Rule 18f–3
under the Act.
8. Applicants state that the Fund does
not currently intend to impose a
contingent deferred sales load
(‘‘CDSC’’). In the event that the Fund
does impose a CDSC, however,
Applicants represent that it would only
do so in compliance with Rule 6c–10
under the Act as if the rule applied to
closed-end management investment
companies. With respect to any waiver
of, scheduled variation in, or
elimination of the CDSC, the Fund will
comply with Rule 22d–1 under the Act
as if the Fund were an open-end
investment company and will be
applied uniformly to all shareholders of
the Fund.
9. Applicants represent that all
expenses incurred by the Fund will be
allocated among the various classes of
Shares based on the net assets of the
Fund attributable to each class, except
that the net asset value and expenses of
each class will reflect distribution fees,
service fees, and any other expenses of
that class. Expenses of the Fund
allocated to a particular class of Shares
will be borne on a pro rata basis by each
outstanding Share of that class.
Applicants state that each Fund will
comply with the provisions of Rule
18f–3 under the Act as if it were an
open-end investment company.
10. Applicants state that, from time to
time, the Fund may create and offer
additional classes of Shares, the terms of
which may differ, including in the
following respects: (i) The amount of
fees permitted by different distribution
plans and/or different service fee
arrangements; (ii) voting rights with
respect to a distribution plan and/or
service plan of a class; (iii) different
class designations; (iv) the impact of any

may be adopted by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (‘‘FINRA’’).

class expenses directly attributable to a
particular class of Shares allocated on a
class basis as described in this
application; (v) any differences in
dividends and net asset values per
Share resulting from differences in fees
under a distribution plan and/or service
plan or in class expenses; (vi) any sales
load structure; and (vii) any conversion
features as permitted under the Act.
11. Applicants state that any
repurchase offers made by the Fund will
be made to all classes of Shares at the
same time, in the same proportional
amounts and on the same terms, except
for differences in net asset values per
Share resulting from differences in fees
under a distribution plan and/or service
plan or in class expenses.
12. Applicants represent that the
Fund will disclose in its prospectus the
fees, expenses and other characteristics
of each class of Shares offered for sale
by the prospectus, as is required for
open-end multiple class investment
companies under Form N–1A. As is
required for open-end management
investment companies, the Fund will
disclose its expenses in shareholder
reports, and disclose any arrangements
that result in breakpoints in, or
elimination of, sales loads in its
prospectus.3 In addition, Applicants
will comply with applicable enhanced
fee disclosure requirements for fund of
funds, including registered funds of
hedge funds.4
13. The Fund will comply with any
requirements that the Commission or
FINRA may adopt regarding disclosure
at the point of sale and in transaction
confirmations about the costs and
conflicts of interest arising out of the
distribution of open-end investment
company shares, and regarding
prospectus disclosure of sales loads and
revenue sharing arrangements as if those
requirements applied to the Fund. In
addition, each Fund will contractually
require that any distributor of the
Fund’s Shares comply with such
requirements in connection with the
distribution of such Shares.

investment company may not issue or
sell any senior security if, immediately
thereafter, the company has outstanding
more than one class of senior security.
Applicants state that the creation of
multiple classes of shares of the Fund
may be prohibited by Section 18(c), as
a class may have priority over another
class as to payment of dividends
because shareholders of different classes
would pay different fees and expenses.
2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides
that each share of stock issued by a
registered management investment
company will be a voting stock and
have equal voting rights with every
other outstanding voting stock.
Applicants state that multiple classes of
Fund Shares may violate Section 18(i) of
the Act because each class would be
entitled to exclusive voting rights with
respect to matters solely related to that
class.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that
the Commission may exempt any
person, security or transaction or any
class or classes of persons, securities or
transactions from any provision of the
Act, or from any rule thereunder, if and
to the extent such exemption is
necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act. Applicants
request an exemption under Section 6(c)
from Sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit
the Fund to issue multiple classes of
shares.
4. Applicants submit that the
proposed allocation of expenses and
voting rights among multiple classes is
equitable and will not discriminate
against any group or class of
shareholders. Applicants submit that
the proposed arrangements would
permit a Fund to facilitate the
distribution of its shares and provide
investors with a broader choice of
shareholder services. Applicants assert
that the proposed closed-end
investment company multiple class
structure does not raise the concerns
underlying Section 18 of the Act to any
greater degree than open-end
investment companies’ multiple class
structures that are permitted by Rule
18f–3 under the Act. Applicants state
that each Fund will comply with the
provisions of Rule 18f–3 as if it were an
open-end investment company.
CDSCs
1. Applicants believe that the
requested relief meets the standards of
Section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c–10
under the Act permits open-end
investment companies to impose
CDSCs, subject to certain conditions.

VerDate Sep<11>2014

17:15 Sep 18, 2014

Jkt 232001

Applicants state that any CDSC imposed
by the Fund will comply with Rule 6c–
10 under the Act as if the rule were
applicable to closed-end investment
companies. The Fund also will disclose
CDSCs in accordance with the
requirements of Form N–1A concerning
CDSCs as if the Fund were an open-end
investment company. Applicants further
state that the Fund will apply the CDSC
(and any waivers or scheduled
variations of the CDSC) uniformly to all
shareholders in a given class and
consistently with the requirements of
Rule 22d–1 under the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution
Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and Rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit an
affiliated person of a registered
investment company or an affiliated
person of such person, acting as
principal, from participating in or
effecting any transaction in connection
with any joint enterprise or joint
arrangement in which the investment
company participates unless the
Commission issues an order permitting
the transaction. In reviewing
applications submitted under Section
17(d) and Rule 17d–1, the Commission
considers whether the participation of
the investment company in a joint
enterprise or joint arrangement is
consistent with the provisions, policies
and purposes of the Act, and the extent
to which the participation is on a basis
different from or less advantageous than
that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d–3 under the Act provides
an exemption from Section 17(d) and
Rule 17d–1 to permit open-end
investment companies to enter into
distribution arrangements pursuant to
Rule 12b–1 under the Act. Applicants
request an order under Section 17(d)
and Rule 17d–1 under the Act to the
extent necessary to permit the Fund to
impose asset-based service and/or
distribution fees. Applicants have
agreed to comply with Rules 12b–1 and
17d–3 as if those rules applied to
closed-end investment companies.
Applicants’ Condition
Applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following condition:
Each Fund relying on the order will
comply with the provisions of Rules 6c–
10, 12b–1, 17d–3, 18f–3 and 22d–1
under the Act, as amended from time to
time, as if those rules applied to closedend management investment
companies, and will comply with the
NASD Sales Charge Rule, as amended
from time to time, as if that rule applied

Applicants' Representations

    1. The Fund is a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under 
the Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. 
The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek attractive long-term 
risk adjusted returns. The Fund is a ``fund of funds'' and seeks to 
achieve its objective by investing substantially all of its assets in 
investment vehicles, often referred to as ``hedge funds,'' that are 
managed by independent investment managers.
    2. The Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and is 
registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act 
of 1940. The

[[Page 56410]]

Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund.
    3. The Fund currently issues a single class of Shares (``Initial 
Class''). The Shares are continuously offered and are registered under 
the Securities Act of 1933. Shares of the Fund are not listed on any 
securities exchange, nor quoted on any quotation medium. The Shares are 
not offered or traded on a secondary market. In order to provide a 
limited degree of liquidity, the Fund may from time to time offer to 
repurchase Shares at their then-current net asset value pursuant to 
Rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange 
Act''). Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on 
such terms as may be determined by the Fund's board of directors 
(``Board'') in its sole discretion. The Adviser expects to recommend 
ordinarily that the Board authorize the Fund to offer to repurchase 
Shares from shareholders quarterly.
    4. The Fund's Initial Class is subject to a sales load, but is not 
subject to any service or distribution fee. Shareholders of the Initial 
Class are subject to a repurchase fee if the interval between the date 
of purchase of the Shares and the valuation date with respect to the 
repurchase of Shares is less than one year.
    5. The Applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to issue 
multiple classes of Shares, with varying sales loads and asset-based 
service and/or asset-based distribution fees. Applicants request that 
the order also apply to any other continuously-offered registered 
closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future 
for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or 
under common control with the Adviser, acts as investment adviser, and 
which provides periodic liquidity to its Shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 
under the Exchange Act (together with the Fund, the ``Funds'').\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Any Fund relying on this relief in the future will do so in 
a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of the 
application. Applicants represent that each entity presently 
intending to rely on the requested relief is listed in the 
application as an Applicant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. If the requested relief is granted, the Fund intends to offer 
multiple classes of Shares of the Fund. Each class would be offered at 
net asset value. Because of different class expenses, the net income 
attributable to, and any dividends payable on, each class of Shares may 
differ from each other from time to time. As a result, the net asset 
value per Share of the classes may differ over time.
    7. Applicants represent that each new class of Shares may charge a 
front-end sales load and an annual asset-based service and/or 
distribution fee. Applicants further represent that any distribution 
fee would be paid pursuant to a plan of distribution adopted by the 
Fund in compliance with the provisions of Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under 
the Act as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment 
companies. In addition, any asset-based service fee and distribution 
fee for each class of Shares will comply with the provisions of NASD 
Rule 2830 (``NASD Sales Charge Rule'').\2\ Any repurchase fee will 
apply equally to all shareholders of the Fund, regardless of the class, 
consistent with Section 18 of the Act and Rule 18f-3 under the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Any reference to the NASD Sales Charge Rule includes any 
successor or replacement rule that may be adopted by the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (``FINRA'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Applicants state that the Fund does not currently intend to 
impose a contingent deferred sales load (``CDSC''). In the event that 
the Fund does impose a CDSC, however, Applicants represent that it 
would only do so in compliance with Rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the 
rule applied to closed-end management investment companies. With 
respect to any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the 
CDSC, the Fund will comply with Rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Fund 
were an open-end investment company and will be applied uniformly to 
all shareholders of the Fund.
    9. Applicants represent that all expenses incurred by the Fund will 
be allocated among the various classes of Shares based on the net 
assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net 
asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, 
service fees, and any other expenses of that class. Expenses of the 
Fund allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro 
rata basis by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state 
that each Fund will comply with the provisions of Rule 18f-3 under the 
Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
    10. Applicants state that, from time to time, the Fund may create 
and offer additional classes of Shares, the terms of which may differ, 
including in the following respects: (i) The amount of fees permitted 
by different distribution plans and/or different service fee 
arrangements; (ii) voting rights with respect to a distribution plan 
and/or service plan of a class; (iii) different class designations; 
(iv) the impact of any class expenses directly attributable to a 
particular class of Shares allocated on a class basis as described in 
this application; (v) any differences in dividends and net asset values 
per Share resulting from differences in fees under a distribution plan 
and/or service plan or in class expenses; (vi) any sales load 
structure; and (vii) any conversion features as permitted under the 
Act.
    11. Applicants state that any repurchase offers made by the Fund 
will be made to all classes of Shares at the same time, in the same 
proportional amounts and on the same terms, except for differences in 
net asset values per Share resulting from differences in fees under a 
distribution plan and/or service plan or in class expenses.
    12. Applicants represent that the Fund will disclose in its 
prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class 
of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus, as is required for open-
end multiple class investment companies under Form N-1A. As is required 
for open-end management investment companies, the Fund will disclose 
its expenses in shareholder reports, and disclose any arrangements that 
result in breakpoints in, or elimination of, sales loads in its 
prospectus.\3\ In addition, Applicants will comply with applicable 
enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of funds, including 
registered funds of hedge funds.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Shareholder Reports and Quarterly Portfolio Disclosure 
of Registered Management Investment Companies, Investment Company 
Act Release No. 26372 (Feb. 27, 2004) (adopting release); Disclosure 
of Breakpoint Discounts by Mutual Funds, Investment Company Act

    13. The Fund will comply with any requirements that the Commission 
or FINRA may adopt regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in 
transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest 
arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, 
and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing 
arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Fund. In addition, 
each Fund will contractually require that any distributor of the Fund's 
Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the 
distribution of such Shares.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

Multiple Classes of Shares

    1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a 
closed-end

[[Page 56411]]

investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, 
immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class 
of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple 
classes of shares of the Fund may be prohibited by Section 18(c), as a 
class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends 
because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and 
expenses.
    2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock 
issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting 
stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting 
stock. Applicants state that multiple classes of Fund Shares may 
violate Section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled 
to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to 
that class.
    3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt 
any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, 
securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any 
rule thereunder, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection 
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and 
provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under Section 
6(c) from Sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple 
classes of shares.
    4. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and 
voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not 
discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants 
submit that the proposed arrangements would permit a Fund to facilitate 
the distribution of its shares and provide investors with a broader 
choice of shareholder services. Applicants assert that the proposed 
closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise 
the concerns underlying Section 18 of the Act to any greater degree 
than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are 
permitted by Rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that each Fund 
will comply with the provisions of Rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end 
investment company.

CDSCs

    1. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards 
of Section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end 
investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. 
Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Fund will comply with 
Rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end 
investment companies. The Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance 
with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were 
an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Fund 
will apply the CDSC (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the 
CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently 
with the requirements of Rule 22d-1 under the Act.

Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees

    1. Section 17(d) of the Act and Rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from 
participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any 
joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company 
participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the 
transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under Section 17(d) 
and Rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of 
the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is 
consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and 
the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from Section 
17(d) and Rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter 
into distribution arrangements pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act. 
Applicants request an order under Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 under 
the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Fund to impose asset-
based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to 
comply with Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-
end investment companies.

Applicants' Condition

    Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will 
be subject to the following condition:
    Each Fund relying on the order will comply with the provisions of 
Rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended 
from time to time, as if those rules applied to closed-end management 
investment companies, and will comply with the NASD Sales Charge Rule, 
as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end 
management investment companies.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Kevin M. O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

Evanston Releases New Registered Fund
July 8, 2014 (PLANSPONSOR.com) – Evanston Capital Management has released its Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund.
By Kevin McGuinness editors@plansponsor.com | July 08, 2014 






















  














The alternative investment firm launched the fund on July 1.
The Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund is a closed-end, non-exchange
listed investment registered under Investment Company Act of 1940. Shares of the fund, however, are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The fund is available
to U.S. accredited investors, including Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(ERISA) accounts, and has an initial minimum investment of $50,000. The fund offers Form
1099 tax reporting.Evanston Capital Management has historically offered private
funds-of-hedge-funds available solely to qualified purchasers. The new fund is
intended to complement these private vehicles and has a similar strategy to
Evanston Capital Management’s flagship fund-of-hedge-funds that was launched in
2002.The fund seeks attractive long-term risk adjusted returns
and seeks to achieve its objective by investing all its assets in
underlying hedge funds, many of which seek to achieve their investment objectives
with minimal correlation to traditional equity or fixed-income indices. As of
July 1, the fund has exposure to the following strategies: long/short equity, relative value, event driven, and global asset allocation.“We’ve received many requests over the years for funds
accessible to a wider range of investors,” says Adam Blitz, CEO of Evanston
Capital Management, located in Evanston, Illinois. “We are very pleased to
launch the Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund and to offer Evanston
Capital Management’s first registered version of our fund-of-hedge-fund
strategies to accredited investors. As with our private offerings, we will
apply our extensive experience in hedge fund selection, portfolio construction,
operations and risk management as we strive to realize attractive long-term
risk-adjusted returns for the fund’s investors.”For details about the fund, or to request a prospectus, contact
Carl Gargula at 847-328-4961.More information about Evanston Capital
Management can be found at http://www.evanstoncap.com.

Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund is a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under the Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek attractive long-term risk adjusted returns. The Fund is a “fund of funds” and seeks to achieve its objective by investing substantially all of its assets in investment vehicles, often referred to as “hedge funds,” that are managed by independent investment managers.
2. The Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Start Printed Page 56410Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund.
3. The Fund currently issues a single class of Shares (“Initial Class”). The Shares are continuously offered and are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Shares of the Fund are not listed on any securities exchange, nor quoted on any quotation medium. The Shares are not offered or traded on a secondary market. In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity, the Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Shares at their then-current net asset value pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Fund's board of directors (“Board”) in its sole discretion. The Adviser expects to recommend ordinarily that the Board authorize the Fund to offer to repurchase Shares from shareholders quarterly.
4. The Fund's Initial Class is subject to a sales load, but is not subject to any service or distribution fee. Shareholders of the Initial Class are subject to a repurchase fee if the interval between the date of purchase of the Shares and the valuation date with respect to the repurchase of Shares is less than one year.
5. The Applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares, with varying sales loads and asset-based service and/or asset-based distribution fees. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other continuously-offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser, acts as investment adviser, and which provides periodic liquidity to its Shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act (together with the Fund, the “Funds”).[1] 

6. If the requested relief is granted, the Fund intends to offer multiple classes of Shares of the Fund. Each class would be offered at net asset value. Because of different class expenses, the net income attributable to, and any dividends payable on, each class of Shares may differ from each other from time to time. As a result, the net asset value per Share of the classes may differ over time.
7. Applicants represent that each new class of Shares may charge a front-end sales load and an annual asset-based service and/or distribution fee. Applicants further represent that any distribution fee would be paid pursuant to a plan of distribution adopted by the Fund in compliance with the provisions of Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under the Act as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies. In addition, any asset-based service fee and distribution fee for each class of Shares will comply with the provisions of NASD Rule 2830 (“NASD Sales Charge Rule”).[2] 
           Any repurchase fee will apply equally to all shareholders of the Fund, regardless of the class, consistent with Section 18 of the Act and Rule 18f-3 under the Act.
8. Applicants state that the Fund does not currently intend to impose a contingent deferred sales load (“CDSC”). In the event that the Fund does impose a CDSC, however, Applicants represent that it would only do so in compliance with Rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule applied to closed-end management investment companies. With respect to any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the CDSC, the Fund will comply with Rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Fund were an open-end investment company and will be applied uniformly to all shareholders of the Fund.
9. Applicants represent that all expenses incurred by the Fund will be allocated among the various classes of Shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of Rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
10. Applicants state that, from time to time, the Fund may create and offer additional classes of Shares, the terms of which may differ, including in the following respects: (i) The amount of fees permitted by different distribution plans and/or different service fee arrangements; (ii) voting rights with respect to a distribution plan and/or service plan of a class; (iii) different class designations; (iv) the impact of any class expenses directly attributable to a particular class of Shares allocated on a class basis as described in this application; (v) any differences in dividends and net asset values per Share resulting from differences in fees under a distribution plan and/or service plan or in class expenses; (vi) any sales load structure; and (vii) any conversion features as permitted under the Act.
11. Applicants state that any repurchase offers made by the Fund will be made to all classes of Shares at the same time, in the same proportional amounts and on the same terms, except for differences in net asset values per Share resulting from differences in fees under a distribution plan and/or service plan or in class expenses.
12. Applicants represent that the Fund will disclose in its prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus, as is required for open-end multiple class investment companies under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end management investment companies, the Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and disclose any arrangements that result in breakpoints in, or elimination of, sales loads in its prospectus.[3] 
           In addition, Applicants will comply with applicable enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of funds, including registered funds of hedge funds.[4] 

13. The Fund will comply with any requirements that the Commission or FINRA may adopt regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Fund. In addition, each Fund will contractually require that any distributor of the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of such Shares.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end Start Printed Page 56411investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Fund may be prohibited by Section 18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses.
2. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that multiple classes of Fund Shares may violate Section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under Section 6(c) from Sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of shares.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit a Fund to facilitate the distribution of its shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder services. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying Section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by Rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that each Fund will comply with the provisions of Rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
CDSCs
1. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of Section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Fund will comply with Rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Fund were an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Fund will apply the CDSC (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the CDSC) uniformly to all shareholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of Rule 22d-1 under the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and Rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 under the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies.
Applicants' Condition
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Each Fund relying on the order will comply with the provisions of Rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with the NASD Sales Charge Rule, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.
Start Signature

Deputy Secretary.

The alternative investment firm launched the fund on July 1.
The Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund is a closed-end, non-exchange
listed investment registered under Investment Company Act of 1940. Shares of
the fund, however, are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The fund is
available to U.S. accredited investors, including Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) accounts, and has an initial minimum investment of
$50,000. The fund offers Form 1099 tax reporting.Evanston Capital Management has historically offered private
funds-of-hedge-funds available solely to qualified purchasers. The new fund is
intended to complement these private vehicles and has a similar strategy to
Evanston Capital Management’s flagship fund-of-hedge-funds that was launched in
2002.The fund seeks attractive long-term risk adjusted returns
and seeks to achieve its objective by investing all its assets in underlying
hedge funds, many of which seek to achieve their investment objectives with
minimal correlation to traditional equity or fixed-income indices. As of July
1, the fund has exposure to the following strategies: long/short equity,
relative value, event driven, and global asset allocation.“We’ve received many requests over the years for funds
accessible to a wider range of investors,” says Adam Blitz, CEO of Evanston
Capital Management, located in Evanston, Illinois. “We are very pleased to
launch the Evanston Alternative Opportunities Fund and to offer Evanston
Capital Management’s first registered version of our fund-of-hedge-fund
strategies to accredited investors. As with our private offerings, we will apply
our extensive experience in hedge fund selection, portfolio construction,
operations and risk management as we strive to realize attractive long-term
risk-adjusted returns for the fund’s investors.”For details about the fund, or to request a prospectus,
contact Carl Gargula at 847-328-4961.More
