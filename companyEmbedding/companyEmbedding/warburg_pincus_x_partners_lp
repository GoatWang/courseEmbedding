Joseph P. Landy and Charles R. Kaye





The firm’s unique, globally integrated partnership ensures that all of our resources are committed to the success of each portfolio company. Regardless of an investment’s stage of development, industry focus or geography — the right people, with the right experience, are available to every entrepreneur and management team.
At Warburg Pincus, private equity investing is our only business. Established more than 50 years ago, Warburg Pincus has invested more than $60 billion in more than 780 companies in more than 40 countries around the world.
Warburg Pincus traces its roots to E.M. Warburg & Co., founded in 1939. The firm was acquired by Lionel I. Pincus & Co. in 1966, forming Warburg Pincus. John Vogelstein joined Lionel Pincus and together they helped to create the private equity industry. Today Warburg Pincus is a globally-integrated partnership led by co-chief executive officers Charles R. Kaye and Joseph P. Landy.
The firm’s strategy combines deep industry expertise and local market experience; the flexibility to support all stages of company development; a long-term investment horizon; and fully aligned interests among our portfolio company management, limited partners and general partners. Partnering with superior management teams, Warburg Pincus helps companies formulate strategy, conceptualize and implement suitable financing structures and recruit talented executives.
We take a long-term perspective and invest in businesses at all stages of development, from founding start-ups and fostering growth in developing companies to leading complex recapitalizations or large-scale buy-outs of more mature businesses. This approach also applies to our expectations of accountability, ethical business conduct and a sense of responsibility for the local communities in which we operate.
The firm’s social commitment is further evidenced by our charitable giving program, community outreach and volunteer services and the Warburg Pincus Foundation.
