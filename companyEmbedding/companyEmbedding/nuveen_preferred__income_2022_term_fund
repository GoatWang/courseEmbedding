Objective
The Fund seeks to provide a high level of current income and total return.


Highlights

Seeks to provide high current income and total return from a portfolio of primarily preferred securities 
Five-year term with return of then-current NAV
May enhance diversification of a stock and/or bond portfolio
May help mitigate interest-rate risk through the use of preferred securities with various coupon structures and a limited duration




Investment Strategy


		The Fund provides access to both the exchange-traded and over-the-counter preferred securities markets, seeking to capitalize on price discrepancies that may occur between these two markets. The Fund also has the flexibility to opportunistically invest in preferred securities with various coupon structures including fixed-to-floating structures, which may help reduce interest rate risk and enhance performance in a rising rate environment. 
	

		The Fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in preferred and other income-producing securities. The Fund may invest without limit in below investment grade securities but no more than 10% in securities rated below B-/B3 at the time of investment. Up to 40% of its managed assets may be in securities issued by companies located anywhere in the world, but no more than 10% in securities of issuers in emerging market countries, and 100% in U.S. dollar-denominated securities. The Fund does not invest in contingent capital securities (“CoCos”). The Fund uses leverage.
