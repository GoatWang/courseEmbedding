We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares of common
stock offered by us in this public offering will be approximately $ 22.9
million, or $ 26.5 million if the underwriters elect to exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based on an assumed initial public offering
price of $34.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated price range
set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each
$1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $34.00
 per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering
by $ 0.7 million , or $ 0.8 million  if the underwriters elect to exercise their
option to purchase additional shares in full, assuming the number of shares
offered by us, as indicated on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the
same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to:
 
. support the continued growth of Paragon Bank;

. to retire our outstanding bank holding company loan, which had a balance of    
  $4.2 million as of March 31, 2016 and bears interest at the prime interest rate
  plus 0.75% (currently 4.25%) and matures in November 2017; and                 

. for general corporate purposes, including for possible acquisitions of, or     
  investments in, bank or permissible non-bank entities, though we do not have   
  any agreements or understandings presently with respect to any acquisitions or 
  investments.


Commercial banking in North Carolina is extremely competitive due in large part
to the early adoption of statewide branching. For example, as of June 30, 2015,
data provided by the FDIC Deposit Market Share Report indicated that within our
market areas, there were 42­­ different commercial and savings institutions
operating a total of 496 offices (256 in Wake County (Raleigh and Cary) and 240
in Mecklenburg County (Charlotte)). We compete in our market area with large
regional and nationwide banking organizations, other federally and state
chartered financial institutions such as savings and loan institutions and
credit unions, mortgage companies and other lenders engaged in the business of
extending commercial credit. Many of our competitors have broader geographic
markets and higher lending limits than we do and are also able to provide more
services and make greater use of media advertising. All of the markets in which
we have a banking office are also served by branches of the largest banks in the
Southeast, some of which are among the largest institutions in the United
States.

The enactment of legislation authorizing interstate banking has led to increases
in the size and financial resources of some of our competitors. In addition, as
a result of interstate banking, out-of-state commercial banks have acquired
North Carolina banks and heightened the competition among banks in North
Carolina. Despite the competition in our market area, we believe that superior
customer service distinguishes us from our competition. We offer customers
modern banking services in a highly responsive private bank environment. We
provide personalized services and attract customers by being sensitive to their
individualized needs. We believe our approach to business builds goodwill among
our customers, stockholders, and the communities we serve, resulting in
referrals from stockholders and satisfied customers. We also rely on targeted
marketing to attract new customers. To enhance a positive image in the
communities that we serve, we support and participate in local events and our
officers and directors are active in supporting local civic and charitable
organizations.


Company Description
We were formed with the goal of filling what we believe is an unmet demand in   
our markets: delivering the commercial and private banking expertise and        
professionalism of a large bank with the responsive, personalized service of a  
community bank. We offer the client experience of a


 private bank for businesses 
and individuals through highly talented and experienced employees at carefully  
selected, professional office locations. Our combination of efficient staffing  
and a limited number of professional offices helps us drive profitability and   
create stockholder value, including by operating more efficiently than many of  
our peer institutions.                                                          

As of March 31, 2016 we had net loans of $1.04 billion, total deposits of $1.05 
billion, stockholders’ equity of $100.2 million and total assets of $1.34       
billion. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we generated net income of  
$2.8 million, earnings per diluted common share of $0.62, a tax equivalent net  
interest margin of 3.51% and an efficiency ratio of 58.69%. For the year ended  
December 31, 2015, we generated net income of $11.2 million, earnings per       
diluted common share of $2.47, a tax equivalent net interest margin of 3.51% and
an efficiency ratio of 56.64%.                                                                                                                     

We are a North Carolina corporation and bank holding company registered under   
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and headquartered in Raleigh, 
North Carolina.  Founded as North Carolina's sole business-only bank,  we began 
operations in 1999  as Paragon Commercial Bank to serve the financial needs of  
commercial clients, professional service firms, their owners and other targeted 
clients with a superior client experience delivered from a single office. In    
2001 we formed Paragon Commercial Corporation as the Bank’s holding company, in 
2006 we expanded to the Charlotte, North Carolina market and opened our second  
office, and in 2014 we opened our third office in Cary, North Carolina.      

Our commitment to our professional, profitable business strategy has driven the 
development of our strong banking brand in our market areas and supported our   
increased focus on offering banking products and services to the principals of  
our core business clients.  
---    

We conduct all of our business activities through our banking subsidiary,       
Paragon Commercial Bank, which operates under the trade name “Paragon Bank.” Our
principal executive office is located at 3535 Glenwood Avenue, Raleigh, North   
Carolina 27612 and our telephone number is (919) 788-7770. Our website is

	Schrift ändern: (0 Bewertungen)ACCESSWIRE·Mehr Nachrichten von ACCESSWIREParagon Commercial Corporation Reports Loan Growth of 9% for the Second Quarter of 2017Highlights:Loan growth of $108.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 13% year-to-date Credit quality remains strong with nonperforming loans at only 0.04% of total loans and no accruing loans past due greater than 30 days at June 30, 2017Net interest income of $13.0 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 15% over the same period in the prior yearSecond quarter 2017 net income of $3.3 million, only a $192,000 decrease over the same period in the prior year despite a $650,000 increase in loan loss provisions and $368,000 in merger related costsSecond quarter 2017 ROAA of 0.83% and ROAE of 9.19%RALEIGH, NC / ACCESSWIRE / July 19, 2017 / Paragon Commercial Corporation (the "Company") (NASDAQ: PBNC), parent company of Paragon Bank (the "Bank"), today reported unaudited financial results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2017. Net income during the three-month period decreased 6% to $3.3 million, compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in earnings was primarily driven by a $650,000 loan loss provision as the Company increased its allowance for loan losses commensurate with loan growth. There were no such loan loss provisions recorded during the same period in 2016. In addition, the Company incurred $368,000 in costs directly attributable to its pending merger with TowneBank. These increased costs were mostly offset by an increase in net interest income which was a result of continued loan growth. Fully diluted earnings per share ("EPS") were $0.61 for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $0.75 for the same period in 2016. The decrease in EPS was directly attributable to the impact on average shares outstanding as a result of the additional shares issued as a result of the Company's initial public offering ("IPO") and listing on Nasdaq during the second quarter of 2016."Paragon's loan growth continues to be outstanding. A major driver in the pending merger with TowneBank is our ability to generate growth in our loan portfolio to take advantage of our dynamic markets," said Robert C. Hatley, President and CEO.The annualized return on average assets for the second quarter of 2017 was 0.83% and the annualized return on average equity was 9.19%, compared to 1.00% and 13.41%, respectively, for the same ratios in the second quarter of 2016. Those ratios were impacted by the additional capital as a result of the IPO as well as the added loan loss provisions and merger related costs previously discussed.Consolidated AssetsTotal consolidated assets on June 30, 2017 were $1.64 billion compared to $1.50 billion as of December 31, 2016. Assets increased during the quarter by $85.5 million primarily as a result of strong loan demand.Loan PortfolioLoans outstanding increased by $108.9 million during the second quarter from $1.23 billion at March 31, 2017 to $1.34 billion at June 30, 2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, loans have increased $148.6 million, an annualized rate of 25.0%. All loan categories experienced strong growth except construction and land development, which decreased $7.9 million during the second quarter of 2017. Growth for the other loan categories for the same period was as follows: commercial real estate - $41.7 million, owner occupied commercial real estate - $9.7 million, multifamily - $14.7 million, consumer real estate - $24.5 million, commercial and industrial - $19.1 million, and consumer and other loans - $7.1 million. The Company continues to see strong loan growth throughout the Raleigh, Charlotte, and Cary markets.Deposit PortfolioTotal deposits decreased by $90.1 million during the second quarter offsetting strong deposit growth in the first quarter. The first quarter's growth was primarily driven by temporary increases in the balances of several existing deposit customers. For the year, deposits are up $2.5 million despite the Company's continued effort to pay down wholesale deposits which have decreased by $36.8 million year-to-date. During the second quarter, demand account balances decreased $22.0 million and money market and interest checking accounts decreased $54.5 million. In addition, time deposits decreased $13.7 million, as the Company reduced its brokered deposit portfolio by $15.0 million or 27%. The decline in deposits required the Company to increase its Federal Home Loan Bank advances by $170.0 million during the quarter.Credit QualityThe Company recorded a $650,000 loan loss provision for the second quarter of 2017 as a result of the growth in total loans. There was no provision for loan losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was 0.67% and 0.66%, respectively.Asset quality continued to remain strong as nonperforming loans were 0.04% of total loans at June 30, 2017. There were no loans past due 30 days or greater at quarter-end and the ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets including foreclosed real estate was 0.32%.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased by $1.7 million or 15% during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016. Net interest income totaled $13.0 million during the period, representing a net interest margin of 3.51% on a tax-equivalent basis, which was down 0.04% when compared to 3.55% in the second quarter of 2016. Net interest margin decreased primarily as a result of increased rates in FHLB borrowings as a result of the recent moves in target rates by the Federal Reserve.Non-Interest IncomeFor the second quarter of 2017, non-interest income was $494,000, compared to $381,000 for the same period in 2016. The second quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by $45,000 in write-downs or loss on sale of foreclosed real estate. There were no losses on foreclosed real estate in the second quarter of 2017.Non-Interest ExpenseNon-interest expenses in the second quarter of 2017 were $7.9 million, compared to $6.5 million in the second quarter of 2016. Personnel expense increased by $568,000 as the Company added lenders and staff to support its strong growth. In addition, the Company incurred $368,000 in merger related costs in 2017 as a result of the pending merger with TowneBank. There were no such costs in the second quarter of 2016.MEDIA INQUIRIES:Blair Kelly - MMI Public Relations, 919.233.6600 or BKelly@MMIpublicrelations.comMeghan Killela - Paragon Bank, 919.534.7402 or MKillela@ParagonBank.com INVESTOR INQUIRIES:Steve Crouse - Paragon Bank, Chief Financial Officer, 919.534.7404 or SCrouse@ParagonBank.com NEW MEDIA CONTENT:Paragon Bank LinkedIn Page: http://linkd.in/P0o9WcABOUT PARAGON COMMERCIAL CORPORATIONParagon Commercial Corporation is the parent company of Paragon Bank, which provides a private banking experience to businesses, professionals, executives, entrepreneurs, and other individuals.

Actual results might differ materially from those explicit or implicit in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation: failure to obtain all regulatory approvals and meet other closing conditions pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of April 26, 2017, by and among TowneBank, TB Acquisition, LLC, and the Company (the "TowneBank Merger"), including approval by the stockholders of the Company, on the expected terms and time schedule: delay in closing the TowneBank Merger; difficulties and delays in integrating TowneBank' s and the Company's businesses or fully realizing cost savings and other benefits; business disruption as a result of the TowneBank Merger; customer acceptance of TowneBank products and services; potential difficulties encountered in expanding into a new market following the TowneBank Merger; the effects of future economic conditions; governmental fiscal and monetary policies; legislative and regulatory changes; the risks of changes in interest rates; management of growth; fluctuations in our financial results; reliance on key personnel; our ability to compete effectively; privacy, security and other risks associated with our business; and the other factors set forth from time to time in our SEC filings, copies of which are available free of charge within the Investor Relations section of our website at https://paragonbank.com/investor-relations/ or upon request from our investor relations department. Paragon Commercial Corporation assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESSome of the financial measures included in this press release are not measures of financial performance recognized by the United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are "overhead to average assets" and "efficiency ratio." Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of our performance and because of market expectations of use of these ratios to evaluate the Company. Management believes each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information about our financial condition and results of operation."Overhead to average assets" reflects the amount of non-interest expenses incurred in comparison to the total size of the Company and provides investors with an additional measure of our productivity.The efficiency ratio shows the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent and provides investors with a measure of our productivity.These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables at the end of this release under the caption, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures."

Please see "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for a reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES "Overhead to average assets" is defined as non-interest expense less merger related costs divided by total average assets. We believe overhead to average assets is an important indicator of the Company's level of non-interest expenses relative to the Company's overall size, which assists in the evaluation of our productivity. While the overhead to average assets ratio is a measure of productivity, its value reflects the attributes of the business model we employ.

Adjusted operating revenue is equal to net interest income (taxable equivalent) plus non-interest income, adjusted to exclude the impacts of gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains and losses on the sale or write-down of foreclosed real estate because we believe the timing of the recognition of those items to be discretionary. We believe the efficiency ratio is important as an indicator of productivity because it shows the amount of revenue generated by our operations for each dollar spent. While the efficiency ratio is a measure of productivity, its value reflects the attributes of the business model we employ.
