In fiscal 2015, the company generated sales of approximately $1.6 billion in theUS and Canada. Sun Products employs approximately 2,000 people.“This transaction is a major strategic move for Henkel. North America is one of the mostimportant markets for us worldwide. With the acquisition of Sun Products we willimprove our position in the USA, the world’s largest laundry market,” said Henkel ChiefExecutive Officer Hans Van Bylen.
With the acquisition, Henkel will advance to thenumber-two position in the laundry care market in North America.“The partnership between Jeff Ansell and the Sun Products leadership and the VestarConsumer team has been highly successful for our firm and our investors,” said DanO’Connell, chief executive officer and founder of Vestar Capital Partners. “We are proudof the company’s many achievements under our ownership, including improvedprofitability, healthier core brands and strengthened operations and believe thecombination with Henkel's North America business will create a strong platform forfuture success.”

Moving forward with Henkel, we will bring evenmore exciting innovation into the North America market, delighting consumers,customers and our employees with more career-broadening opportunities.”The closing of the transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and othercustomary closing conditions.Morgan Stanley & Co. acted as financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legaladvisor to Sun Products.

L M Well this is interesting, at least to me. It appears a Hedge Fund or Private Money acquired Sun Products, and operated it after being sold off by Unilever. Before that.. it was formerly Huish & Lever Brothers.
I do truly wonder though.. if Henkel will screw up the brands, or mess with things. They now have access to a ton of formulations, and factory's associated with Sun. I guess we can only wonder.

sashanikki That is interesting. Sun makes a lot of detergents, including, I think, Costco detergent and All. I always get a little concerned when a lot of items are made by just a few companies.

georgect First off, ummm...I didn't know they were based in Connecticut (and so close by to where I live).
Second, what will this mean to the product lines All, Wisk, Snuggle, Sun, Surf and Sunlight?
Are they going to reformulate them?
I kind of don't like this.

CubeDweller Hopefully Henkel will take advantage of these new (to them) distribution channels. I would love to see Persil powder detergents in my local grocery.

littlegreeny George, I have similar concerns. Sun Products is a MAJOR player in the laundry aisle and they practically own the private label business. They have some excellent brands, mainly All and Wisk and I'd hate to see them change those formulas. I have a feeling they might discontinue some lines (Wisk, Surf?) to simplify their business and reduce overhead.

L M @sashanikki, they practically make every single private label product. Costco, Target, Wal-Mart, Sam's Club are just some of the ones that are on the top of my head.
@georgect, that's why I posted. The Hedge Fund / Private Money, has for the most part left everything in-tact, and actually improved a few formulas. I've been disappointed by lack of ability for a few things they make.. but, I wonder if Henkel will come in and ruin everything :(
You know.. for years, All & Some Other Brand's we're kinda in a "downhill" mode... and were not heavily advertised. Now.. the brand is pretty recognizable and loved. I wonder if that will all change.

Pat z5/6 MI Laundry Mitch, I  hope you will keep us informed of this news.  I've switched to Wisk and All almost exclusively.  I trust you very much.   Thank  you.
