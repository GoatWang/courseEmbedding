											 		About Horizon Minerals Corp.											 	

													Horizon Minerals Corp. (OTCMKTS:HZNM) was founded in 2011 and is based in Nevada. We have a portfolio of lithium assets and have contracted a prestigious exploration firm, Gold Exploration Management Inc,. to help evaluate additional lithium assets in the Southwestern United States, home to the world's largest lithium industry companies.												













											 		Ever Increasing Demand											 	

													In 2016, the world experienced a lithium supply crisis. Prices for lithium metal more than tripled in China and Australia, and lithium contracts increased dramatically across all global marketplaces. Electric vehicles, which use large quantities of lithium for their batteries, are rapidly gaining popularity among consumers. Even a low-single-digit percentage increase in the market share of electric cars would double the world's lithium demand.												













											 		Lithium on the Rise											 	

													Lithium was the top-performing commodity by price from spring 2015 to spring 2016. Driven by demand growth due to electric cars, smart mobile devices, and other battery-powered technologies, the price of lithium has increased exponentially in many countries. In China and Australia during 2016, some lithium contracts had tripled in price versus 2015 prices.												





 

 



















 
 
 



 





  












Introducing
Horizon Minerals Corp.






The world needs more lithium for the rapidly increasing number of batteries placed in mobile devices and automobiles. Horizon Minerals Corp. owns domestic lithium assets and is actively acquiring more with the goal of satisfying some of the nation’s rapidly growing demand for lithium.






 






















  




















"Lithium prices have more than tripled in the past year." 
- Standard & Poors -

"Lithium carbonate prices have almost quadrupled in the last 15 months." 
- Australian Minister for Mines and Petroleum -

"Sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040. This would be almost 90 times the equivalent figure for 2015." 
- Bloomberg - 















				Horizon Minerals Corp.			







About
Horizon Minerals Corp. was founded in 2011 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company owns domestic lithium assets and is currently evaluating additional lithium opportunities in Nevada and California. North America is home to some of the world’s largest lithium mining companies.





Made In The USA



Horizon Minerals Corp. has acquired domestic lithium assets from David Bending, B.Sc., M.Sc., P.Geo. who has over two decades of expertise in the U.S. natural resource industry. Horizon Minerals Corp. has engaged Mr. Bending to assist in evaluating additional lithium opportunities in Nevada and California. Mr. Bending is actively involved in the lithium industry in Nevada, which hosts the only commercially operational lithium operation in North America: Silver Peak Mine.





U.S. Lithium Industry
The southwestern United States is home to operating lithium mines and some of the world’s largest lithium companies. On August 10, 2016, Horizon announced that it had engaged David Bending to assist Horizon in identifying and acquiring lithium concessions in southwestern United States. The Company subsequently announced that it acquired 1,003 claims in the Great Basin, and that it is actively pursuing additional lithium asset acquisitions.







Lithium Industry Fundamentals
The lithium industry is in the midst of a revolution. While lithium has long been valued as a key component of batteries for consumer electronics, a new development has taken place that has made lithium more valuable than ever before: the rise of electric vehicles. From cars and trucks to trains and even airplanes, more electric vehicles are being produced now than ever before. Electric vehicles require massive amounts of lithium to power them, which is causing a massive increase in demand.


Acknowledged demand growth

For decades, lithium-ion batteries have powered consumer electronics. But recently, a major shift in the market has occurred, as lithium has become a power source for electric cars, public transportation systems and even the electric grid.
On December 2, 2015 Goldman Sachs released a report predicting that lithium would become the “new gasoline.” That report revealed the paradigm-shifting fact that a single Tesla Model S requires as much lithium as 10,000 cell phones.


Insufficient supply growth

Current hard-rock and brine lithium projects are capacity constrained, with output consistently failing to keep pace with demand.
Most brine sources are located in geopolitically unstable regions, and are geographically far removed from major lithium consumers.
The U.S. has only one commercial lithium development operation, and imports 80% of lithium it consumes, despite lithium being considered one of the most important metals for the battery-powered future.


Lithium accounts for roughly 2% of the cost of lithium-ion batteries

This means that the price of lithium can increase dramatically without becoming particularly noticeable to buyers of consumer electronics, electric vehicles or large storage batteries.


Prices are projected to rise

Lithium prices on most exchanges have at least tripled since 2003. In China, growth has been especially fast-paced, with the price of one metric tonne of lithium having increased from US$5,000 in 2015 to over US$22,000 in 2016 on some exchanges.
FMC recently announced an “across-the-board 15% increase in the price of lithium.”



Supply and demand market forces are converging on the lithium industry in an unprecedented way. As new technologies bring demand for lithium higher, the metal remains as rare as ever, with much of the global supply being located in geopolitically unstable regions. This fact presents opportunity for lithium producers in politically stable areas such as Nevada and California.
Even a 1% increase in the market share of electric cars could increase the price of lithium by up to 50%. This bodes well for companies involved in the exploration and extraction of lithium resources.

Lithium Is The New Gasoline:
Goldman Sachs’ Bob Koort
