UPDATED: 7/9/15 4:27 pm ET - adds details
DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. today said its Michigan Assembly Plant will stop building the Focus and C-Max in 2018, in a sign that the automaker sees slow demand for small cars to continue in the foreseeable future.
Ford did not say where it would move Focus and C-Max assembly or which vehicles would replace them at the plant in Wayne, Mich., which employs more than 4,000 workers. Both the Focus and C-Max are due to be redesigned for the 2018 model year.
“We actively are pursuing future vehicle alternatives to produce at Michigan Assembly,” Ford said in a statement, “and will discuss this issue with UAW leadership as part of the upcoming negotiations.”
UAW leaders, who are scheduled to formally open talks with Ford on July 23, posted a letter to their members on Facebook saying they are “extremely confident” that Ford would assign a new product to Michigan Assembly and “maintain a full production schedule” at the plant.
The news comes several weeks after Ford eliminated the plant’s third shift and began cutting about 700 jobs there.
Reviewing options
"We currently are reviewing several possible options for the Focus and C-Max and will share details once our studies are complete,” Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski wrote in an email.
Ford currently builds the Focus in nine plants on four continents, including two in China. It was the top-selling nameplate in the world in 2013, with sales of nearly 1.1 million.
Because Michigan Assembly is one of Ford’s only U.S. plants with any significant excess capacity, the announcement likely means they are headed to Mexico or overseas. Sources have told Automotive News that Ford may move its smallest car, the Fiesta, from Cuautitlan, Mexico, to Thailand in 2017, which would allow for Focus production at the Mexico plant.
Bloomberg and The Detroit News reported that union members at the plant were told that assembly of the vehicles would move to a foreign country.
Several UAW members, commenting on the union’s Facebook posting, dismissed the announcement as pre-negotiation “scare tactics.”
Major investment
Ford spent $550 million to convert the former Michigan Truck Plant into Michigan Assembly, a modern, flexible plant that was a centerpiece of the “small-car offensive” announced by former CEO Alan Mulally after SUV sales plunged. The cost of that overhaul and other actions was covered by a $5.9 billion loan from a U.S. Energy Department fund to encourage production of more fuel-efficient vehicles.
“The transformation of Michigan Assembly Plant embodies the larger transformation under way at Ford,” Mulally said in a May 2009 statement. “This is about investing in modern, efficient and flexible American manufacturing. It is about fuel economy and the electrification of vehicles. It is about leveraging our expertise and vehicle platforms around the world and partnering with the UAW to deliver best-in-class global small cars. It is about skilled and motivated teams working together in new ways to create the future of automobile manufacturing in the United States.”
But with gasoline prices down significantly from a year ago, Focus sales declined 16 percent in June and 3.2 percent in the first half of 2015. C-Max sales have fallen 17 percent this year.
The C-Max, available as either a traditional or plug-in hybrid, has struggled to attract buyers since Ford reduced the car’s fuel-economy ratings by 4 mpg in 2013 and compensated owners for overstating its mileage in ads and window stickers.

            COMMENTEMAILMOREFord said Thursday it will move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars from its Michigan Assembly Plant in 2018, with UAW officials saying they were told the work will leave the U.S..The company's decision sets a potentially combative tone just days before contract talks are scheduled to begin and runs counter to Ford's normal approach to negotiations, which is to emphasize its ability to cooperate with the union. The UAW formally opens negotiations with GM on Monday, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles on Tuesday and Ford the following week."It's very, very unusual," UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles told the Free Press, adding that workers were upset when they were briefed on the news on Thursday. "You never feel good about that kind of information. But I am very, very confident that there will be a replacement product that we will secure for the plant."Industry analyst Dave Sullivan of AutoPacific called it a "a power move before negotiations start ... Before today, Ford didn't really have anything to negotiate on; the UAW had the upper hand. Now Ford has wiggle room to negotiate for jobs and products."Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski declined to say where Ford plans to relocate the manufacturing, and said the site choice will be based on where the cars can be competitively produced.Mexico seems a likely choice, with lower wage costs than Canada or the U.S, and even southern states. Ford has also invested in new plants in the country,lately.Ford's move also comes as a host of automakers, including Ford, are building new plants in Mexico instead of in the U.S. and raises questions about which products could replace the Focus -- a car that symbolized Ford's transformation in 2011 from a company dependent on truck sales to one aimed at building better passenger cars for a global market.Ford insists the Wayne plant, which employs 4,000, will not close. But Adamski would not provide details of any new products being planned for the plant. The company makes the Focus, Focus ST, Focus Electric, C-Max hybrid and C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid at the plant."We will move production of the next-generation Ford Focus and C-MAX, which currently are built at Michigan Assembly Plant, beginning in 2018," the company said in a statement. "We actively are pursuing future vehicle alternatives to produce at Michigan Assembly and will discuss this issue with UAW leadership as part of the upcoming negotiations."The decision prompted an immediate response Thursday  from Settles, who issued a statement on the UAW Ford Department's Twitter account under the headline: "Message from UAW VP Jimmy Settles regarding Ford's announcement to move Focus and C-MAX from MAP TO Mexico by 2018."Settles told the Free Press that Ford said it would move production of the vehicles "outside of the U.S." but did not directly say Mexico.He said a new goal in contract talks is to win a future product for the Wayne plant that would preserve or add jobs."We are just going to get it done," Settles said.Art Schwartz, President at Labor and Economics Associates, said Ford's move underscores the importance of the investment decisions that automakers make.In 2011, the UAW won product and investment commitments that guaranteed the creation of 20,000 jobs."In 2007 and 2011, product guarantees and jobs were a big issue, and I am sure they will be again in 2015," Schwartz said. "I am sure the UAW is very worried about all of the investment that going to Mexico."Ford builds the smaller Fiesta subcompact car in Cuautitlan, Mexico. Its sales have not been strong and there are persistent rumors that Fiesta assembly will be consolidated outside North America and the cars exported back to the U.S. in the future.As for possible vehicles to fill Michigan Assembly, Ford currently imports the popular Transit Connect from Europe and could be considering North American assembly. Other possibilities include a gasoline-engine version of the C-Max, which is sold in Europe while only a hybrid is sold here. And Lincoln is expected to add compact luxury car to its lineup that could be sourced from the Michigan plant. Ford also could use additional capacity to build more Escapes.Smaller cars going southIncreasingly, North America is being divided when it comes to manufacturing with larger and more expensive vehicles produced in the north and smaller less profitable vehicles assembled in Mexico and the southern states.Why Mexico is winning the auto jobs warOf the vehicles built in North America last year, Mexico produced about one in five, or double the rate from 2004. WardsAuto, which tracks production data, expects the rate to increase to one in four by 2020 with new plants adding  1.2 million units of capacity in North America and Mexico getting the lion's share. Virtually every automaker is adding capacity in Mexico, including General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Kia and Mazda.In 2014, automakers announced $18.25 billion in additional investments in North America. The breakdown: almost $10.5 billion for the U.S., $7 billion in new projects for Mexico, and a single $750-million project for Canada, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.That is on top of the 18 plants already in Mexico, and there are least five more planned or under construction. Mexico has seen a 40% increase in auto jobs since 2008 to 675,000 last year while the U.S. saw only a 15% increase in the same period to more than 900,000.Earlier this year, Ford announced it will spend $2.5 billion on new engine and transmission plants in Chihuahua and Guanajuato, in central Mexico, creating 3,800 jobs.Wayne plant once celebratedBack in 2011, Ford touted its $550 million investment in the aging plant in Wayne as a symbol of its global plan to put a bigger emphasis on making better passenger cars.The 2.8 million square foot plant originally opened in 1957. For most of its history, Ford built big trucks and SUVs such as the Ford Bronco, F-150, Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator at the plant before it was idled in 2008 as the automaker's sales were hurt by high gas prices and the worst recession in decades.Ford celebrated the reopening of Michigan Assembly on March 17, 2011, during an event attended by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and many others.But this year, with low gasoline prices falling, the Focus and C-Max hybrid and C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid have seen sales fall.That led to the decision in April to reduce production from three crews to only two shifts and lay off 700 workers although many of the excess workers are filling in for summer vacations at other plants, Adamski said.Focus sales in the first half of 2015 are down 3.2% from a year earlier, while sales of C-Max fell 16.9%.Ford also builds the Focus at plants in China, Argentina, Germany, Russia, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam. The C-Max is also built in Germany.Contact Alisa Priddle at apriddle@freepress.com or 313-222-5394. Follow her on twitter at @AlisaPriddle.

Ford ending Focus, C-Max production in Michigan after 2018

Ford will no longer produce the Focus and C-Max at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, MI, beyond 2018. United Auto Workers vice president Jimmy Settles confirmed this in a letter Thursday, which was posted on Twitter.

According to the UAW Ford Department's tweet, production of the Focus and C-Max will shift to Mexico. Ford isn't confirming this, though – a spokesperson tells Autoblog, "We didn't say that." Instead, Ford issued the following statement about the matter:

We will move production of the next-generation Ford Focus and C-Max, which currently are built at Michigan Assembly Plant, beginning in 2018. We actively are pursuing future vehicle alternatives to produce at Michigan Assembly and will discuss this issue with UAW leadership as part of the upcoming negotiations.

Earlier this year, Ford announced layoffs of 700 employees at the Michigan Assembly Plant, citing slow sales of both the Focus and C-Max. The MAP was once heralded as a flexible, futuristic facility when it was retooled for C-segment car production in 2009. Prior to that, the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs were built at the Wayne facility. It also produced the iconic Ford Bronco.

The future of the MAP is uncertain, but the UAW remains hopeful. In Settles' letter, he writes, "We are extremely confident that a new product commitment will be secured during the upcoming 2015 negotiations and that the Michigan Assembly Plant will maintain a full production schedule."

WeatherTech 01Bring Your Life Wherever You Go02A Whole New Look for Your Interior03After the great success the Toyota Prius has achieved in the American market, Ford was getting serious about hybrids as well. As a result, both the Ford C-Max  Energi Plug-in Hybrid and the C-Max Hybrid were unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in 2011. Both models are based on the European diesel- and gasoline-powered versions and, same as the Europen C-Max, have only five seats. The core basics of the MPV’s hybrid system are similar to those of the Toyota Prius and the old Ford Escape: the gasoline engine operates in perfect tandem with a two-motor, planetary-gear CVT that provides traction power to the car’s wheels by means of an electric motor and changes transmission modes by using the combustion motor. Instead of a 2.5L four-cylinder Atkinson-cycle engine found in the Ford Escape, the C-Max features a 2.0L engine joined with an eCVT (electronically controlled continuously variable transmission).
Aside from the fact that both the all-new Hybrid and Energi Plug-in Hybrid run on a combination of gas and electric power, the versions have many other similarities. Each model also features such efficient parts and systems as a high-voltage lithium-ion battery (though the C-Max Energi has a bigger one) that is sure to run at higher speeds and for longer periods; the SmartGauge with EcoGuide that is an advanced instrument panel to provide drivers with the information they need to make smarter driving decisions; the SYNC with MyFord Touch which is a voice-activated technology aimed to help you concentrate on the way ahead while staying connected to the world. What an owner of the C-Max is guaranteed to get is the sporty performance and style of a 100% Ford vehicle along with the additional benefit of leaving a small carbon footprint.
The main difference between the C-Max Hybrid and Energi Plug-in Hybrid is that the latter is the first plug-in production automobile for Ford. In other words, the C-Max Energi while operating like a conventional hybrid is like a ‘hybrid plus.’ Its plug-in capability allows to charge the battery by using either a typical 120-volt or a 240-volt outlet upgraded with available electric vehicle supply equipment. Also this model can boast of an EPA-estimated rating of 100 combined MPG-e (miles per gallon equivalent), which is the most efficient combined MPG-e in comparison to its competitors. In addition, Ford equipped its C-Max Energi with a button set in the center stack that offers drivers an opportunity to switch the operation of their vehicle between three modes, including the conventional hybrid mode (the powertrain combines gasoline and electric engine power as appropriate); electric-only driving (without using combustion engine power); or a battery-saving mode (the battery power is reserved for later use).
Whichever model of the Ford C-Max suits your needs and lifestyle, both are guaranteed to provide performance, efficiency, style, and comfort to its owner. Each and every part or accessory found on the vehicle, either interior or exterior, is designed with a strong attention to detail, starting from a sophisticated steering system and 240-Volt charging station to the heated seats and rain-sensing wipers. Put differently, the C-Max is simply filled with innovative parts and accessories as well as with intuitive technologies built for living life to the max.

I bought this car new and the brakes rumbled and grinding noise of metal on metal from 3,000 miles till now 33,000 miles. The original Ford Motorcraft brakes were poor at best. I have already been through the break in process of the rotors and pads and the car stops very well and quiet.BPosted by Brian (West Milford, NJ) / November 13, 20162013 Ford C-MAXWas this review helpful for you?

This is another hit by weather tech this windshield shade looks nice and clean its a perfect fit, it doesn't let any light through, if you have dark tinted windows (like me)  you can't  even see in the car which makes it makes for a nice safety feature. (If someone can't see in your car with anything of value chances they won't waste time breaking in) Also has a black side to it for winter so your windshield won't frost up on you very cool. Really easy to use there is a rear view mirror cut for easy installation fits snug so it stays up and the material so flexible it comes down just as easy. Fold it up flat also the mounts Velcro strap keeps it closed and slides right under neath the seat!

I like how snug they fit and the slight cup-like design that catches debris and prevents it from spilling over onto the carpet unlike regular rubber mats. I work at a place with dirt roads and parking areas which tend to get very muddy and were making my car look awful. I chose these over the other brand just because I didn't like having the red logo that the competitor uses on theirs. Overall, it's been a good deal and so much easier to clean.

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Ford has been producing top-quality vehicles for over a hundred years. Founded by the legendary Henry Ford, the company got its start in the burgeoning Detroit auto industry in 1903. The first mass produced automobile in history was Ford's infamous Model T, a benchmark in which all auto companies would soon take note of. The Model T set the tempo for an affordable yet capable car in which drivers of all economic standings could purchase, setting another standard in the manufacturing and pricing of automobiles throughout the country. Ford took over Lincoln in 1925 to be the brand's luxury division. In the dawn of the thirties following the Great Depression, Ford also created Mercury, a badge that would go on to develop medium-priced vehicles in order to cover a wider demographic of drivers.
Ford has been responsible for churning out fleet after fleet of influential automobiles. The Thunderbird arrived during the baby boom and made an immediate impact. Fashionably styled with power windows and strong performance, the Thunderbird was a glimpse of what was to come with the era of luxurious muscle cars. The '60s saw Ford create even more buzz with the unveiling of the compact Falcon and of course, the Mustang. The first "pony car" that featured a long hood, lower-slung stance, and a reputation for performance, the Ford Mustang is credited with creating a whole new genre of turbocharged domestic machines that would eventually be copied by rivals Chevy and Chrysler. Ford's F-series, a staple since the 1950's, also became an established success, providing a wide range of trucks the average American worker could relate to. As with every US automaker, the oil crisis in conjunction with new government regulations made the '70s a tough time for the brand. But the next decade would see a welcome rebirth that would sustain the company for years to come.
From the Bronco to the ever-popular Explorer, Ford's foray into SUVs has been a triumph. The Ford Taurus also pitched in to give the brand a competitive sedan that was versatile and affordable. And of course, the strong presence of the Ford F-150 and F-250 have brought the automaker added footing along with a long reach into every demographic. Ford has also not remained on the sidelines in terms of the growing "green" movement. Thanks to its Flexible Fuel variations along with a fleet of hybrids, Ford has been very much involved as well as innovative with respect to providing fuel-efficient options that deliver on both performance and reliability. The company is also not limited to North America and Canada. Ford vehicles are currently available all over the globe, including Australia, South America, Africa, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. With a history steeped in tradition, Ford is still as influential as ever before and the future looks just as promising.
One of the first names in American automotive versatility and efficiency, Ford didn't just set the bar for how automobiles were viewed and produced, they created the cast in which the bar was molded out of. From the earliest Model T to the Escape Hybrid, there is no disputing the fact that Ford's place is cemented as one of the industry's giants because the brand covers all the bases, from street performance and practicality, to comfort and style. Ford just keeps giving people what they want. No wonder why their drivers are so loyal. And there's no question about it, your Ford is important to you. It's important to us, also.

The product was shipped a d received as promised. Set up time is about 10 minutes or less when you do it a couple of times. It held up perfectly on the wind blown Oregon Coast and resisted the cold in the 4 feet of snow at Crater Lake Campground. We had several people stop and ask where we got it at and of course referred them to CARiD.com. Ours mounted on our 2004 Cadillac Escalade. We will probably never camp another way. It Is perfect if your in a campground or doing dispersed camping. Super comfortable and looks great!
