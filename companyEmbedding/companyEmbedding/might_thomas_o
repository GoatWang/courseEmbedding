Product Description

Here is a model railway lamp inspired by the one found in the TV Show Thomas and Friends. It is currently scaled for O-gauge, but you can soon find it in other sizes for different scales soon. Right now it has a hole on the bottom for an LED if you can fid one in there, or to just help out with painting,etc.  Perfect scaling for the Lionel Thomas series of locomotives. If you require modification of this lamp in anyway, please drop me a message and I'll try to accomodate your wishes.
