                For years, the evangelical church and its members have debated whether the Bible should be interpreted literally or symbolically in regards to the age of the earth. In their groundbreaking new book, In the Beginning ... We Misunderstood, authors Johnny V. Miller and John M. Soden say that all these arguments have missed the point. Rather, what Christians really need to know is how to interpret the Bible in its original context. Exposing the fallacies of trying to make the biblical text fit a specific scientific presupposition, Miller and Soden offer a new approach to interpreting Genesis 1 that explores the creation account based on how the original audience would have understood its teaching. First, the authors present a clear explanation of the past and present issues in interpreting the first chapter of the Bible. Second, Miller and Soden break down the creation account according to its historical and cultural context by comparing and distinguishing both the Egyptian and Mesopotamian settings. Finally, they explore common objections to help readers understand the significance that the creation account has for theology today. Christians need not look any further than Genesis 1 to find clues to its meaning. Both irenic and bathed in Scripture, In the Beginning ... We Misunderstood will equip every believer to navigate the creation wars, armed with biblically sound explanations.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREDeer Camp: Last Light In The Northeast Kingdomby Miller, John M.Honorable Mention, 1992 Golden Light Book Awards sponsored by the Maine Photographic Workshops.Neither advocacy nor indictment of deer hunting, Deer Camp documents the rituals and traditions of hunting season in Vermont's fabled Northeast Kingdom, a landscape increasingly threatened by development and changing social values. John Miller's text and photographs capture the culture of hunting and its place in country life. The cabins, the hunters and their families, and hunting artifacts and memorabilia are evocatively chronicled.The sixty black-and-white photographs record with unsentimental honesty the multigenerational ritual of deer camp, showing the camps themselves (ranging from converted school buses with stovepipes sticking out the roofs to comfortable second homes in the woods), the pickups and jalopies, hand-drawn maps and hand-carved furniture, polished snowshoes, inlaid rifles, smoking camp stoves, and snowy woodpiles.Miller's text details - among much else - the methodology of the hunt, woods lore and recipes, and the basics of camp life and ritual. Especially moving are the oral histories he includes along with the narrative which reveal the complicated richness of the hunter's world: its hardness, its camaraderie, its passion, and its underlying respect and reverence for the woods and the deer.Copublished with the Vermont Folklife CenterGeneralCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

About

In the early 1970s, celebrated artist John M. Miller abandoned figurative painting and stripped art down to its essence, which, for him, took the form of angled, colored bars repeated across the picture plane. He has been painting these bars—in shades of white, black, blue, violet, red, yellow, and green acrylic on unprimed canvases, ranging in scale from intimate to encompassing—for more than 40 years. Meticulous and meditative, his compositions have been variously categorized as Op Art and Geometric Abstraction, and compared to the works of Agnes Martin and Brice Marden. Miller’s works require and reward viewers’ slow attention, which allows the eye to perceive a sense of rhythmic movement in the interplay of the bars, and the mind to open to their various associations—to weaving, stitching, or a freshly raked Zen rock garden.

About

In the early 1970s, celebrated artist John M. Miller abandoned figurative painting and stripped art down to its essence, which, for him, took the form of angled, colored bars repeated across the picture plane. He has been painting these bars—in shades of white, black, blue, violet, red, yellow, and green acrylic on unprimed canvases, ranging in scale from intimate to encompassing—for more than 40 years. Meticulous and meditative, his compositions have been variously categorized as Op Art and Geometric Abstraction, and compared to the works of Agnes Martin and Brice Marden. Miller’s works require and reward viewers’ slow attention, which allows the eye to perceive a sense of rhythmic movement in the interplay of the bars, and the mind to open to their various associations—to weaving, stitching, or a freshly raked Zen rock garden.
