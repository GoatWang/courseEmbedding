                    Toledo is a city in and the county seat of Lucas County, Ohio, United States. Toledo is in northwest Ohio, at the western end of Lake Erie bordering the state of Michigan. The city was founded by United States citizens in 1833 on the west bank of the Maumee River, and originally incorporated as part of Monroe County, Michigan Territory. It was re-founded in 1837, after conclusion of the Toledo War, when it was incorporated in Ohio. Toledo continued to expand in population and industry into the early 20th century. Because of its dependence on manufacturing, the city was hit hard by the Great Depression. Many large-scale WPA projects were constructed to reemploy citizens in the 1930s. Some of these include the amphitheater and aquarium at the Toledo Zoo and a major expansion to the Toledo Museum of Art.

                     Welcome to the City of Medina.  Our community, offers government services, economic development, and parks and recreational opportunities. Medina hosts many activities throughout the year for all to enjoy. Come see all that Medina has to offer.

Medina is only 33 miles south of Cleveland and 23 miles west of Akron. This convenient location makes for easy access to airports, sporting events, entertainment, shopping, colleges, and universities. We have a low crime rate, low sales taxes, and great schools. In the past Medina has been rated #40 on the list of CNN Money Magazine's top 100 best places to live in the United States.

When describing Medina it's best to start from its historic square. This picturesque square is the place of summer concerts, farmers markets, restaurants, and stores. Our square is the hub of Medina's historic district. Tree lined streets with Victorian homes extend out from the square continuing the historic character of this story book community.

Some of our local businesses have been a part of Medina since the 1800's. While Medina has an obvious appreciation of its history it is far from a community stuck in the past. Medina can boast a wealth of highly educated residents that make up the workforce driving modern and progressive businesses. With a business community made up of high tech industry, advanced polymer products, green industry, and a robust Medical sector, Medina has its roots in the past but its eyes on the future. Our ever growing business community displays a spirit of creativity and innovation. There is a lot of support for businesses here; the City of Medina is always willing to work with local businesses to help them realize their vision.

Medina is a great place to live, a great place to do business, and a great place to visit. Please join us in enjoying all that Medina has to offer!
