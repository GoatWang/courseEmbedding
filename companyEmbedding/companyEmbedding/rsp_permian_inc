RSP Permian, Inc. Announces Potential Midland Basin Acquisition and Production Update

						 from   RSP Permian, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


DALLAS, Oct. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- RSP Permian, Inc. ("RSP" or the "Company") (NYSE:   RSPP) today announced it has signed a letter of intent to acquire undeveloped acreage and oil and natural gas producing properties located in the core of the Midland Basin for an approximate aggregate purchase price of $137.0 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.  In addition, the Company provided a production update for the third quarter of 2015.  
Acquisition Highlights:

Privately negotiated transaction between RSP and Wolfberry Partners Resources LLC, an entity owned in part by affiliates of the Company 
Approximately 4,100 net surface acres and 15,000 net effective horizontal acres 
86 net horizontal drilling locations in 5 zones, 21 in the Middle Spraberry, 34 in the Lower Spraberry, 10 in the Wolfcamp A, 10 in the Wolfcamp B and 11 in the Wolfcamp D 
100% RSP operated upon closing, with average lateral length of inventory of approximately 8,100' 
Net production averaged approximately 1.9 MBoe/d in August. Acquiring 25 producing wells, 4 horizontal wells (1 Middle Spraberry, 1 Lower Spraberry, 1 Wolfcamp A and 1 Wolfcamp B) and 21 vertical wells 
Largely contiguous acreage allowing for drilling of longer laterals and conducive for efficient infrastructure development
"The potential acquisition shows our commitment to grow our existing, high-return horizontal inventory. If the potential acquisition closes, we will have meaningfully enhanced our acreage footprint and increased our horizontal development inventory in the core of the Midland Basin by over 25% in the past few months.  These assets, which are in close proximity to our existing operations, are in the heart of the Midland Basin where we have drilled some of our best wells.  Based on our analysis of the geological and other technical data related to these properties, the results of the initial four horizontal wells (targeting four different horizontal zones) and vertical wells drilled, and nearby offset horizontal results by other operators, we expect these assets will generate returns that rival any asset that we currently own and we intend to begin drilling on these properties soon after we close on them," stated Steve Gray, Chief Executive Officer of RSP.  
If a definitive purchase and sale agreement is ultimately reached, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of the fourth quarter.  RSP would have to fund $60.0 million at closing and the remainder of the approximate $137.0 million purchase price would be payable within nine months thereafter and would bear interest at the greater of 2.1% per annum or LIBOR plus 1.5%. At RSP's sole discretion, such payable may be prepaid without any penalty.  
The acquisition is subject to the completion of customary due diligence, negotiation of a definitive purchase and sale agreement, approval of the Company's board, the receipt of a fairness opinion from an investment banking advisory firm, closing conditions and purchase price adjustments.  There can be no assurance that the Company will reach a definitive purchase agreement on the terms described herein or at all or close on the acquisition.  
Production Update:
For the third quarter of 2015, RSP's net daily production is expected to average between 23,500 – 24,000 Boe/d (approximately 75% oil), a 110% - 114% increase over our average net daily production for the third quarter of 2014 and an 18% - 21% sequential quarterly growth rate over our average net daily production for the second quarter of 2015.  Based on continued strong well performance and successful spacing pilots, RSP is increasing its internal estimates for type curves and estimated ultimate recovery ("EURs") for wells drilled in the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp A zones above those reviewed by its independent reserve engineers at December 31, 2014.

Strengths - RSP Permian






















































Strengths




The Permian Basin is an attractive operating area due to its multiple horizontal and vertical target horizons, favorable operating environment, high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, substantial existing infrastructure, well-developed network of oilfield service providers, long-lived reserves with consistent reservoir quality and historically high drilling success rates. We believe that the following strengths will help us drive shareholder value:








Attractively positioned in the oil-rich core of the Midland Basin.








All of our leasehold acreage is located in the Permian Basin in West Texas, and substantially all of our current properties are well-positioned in what we believe to be the core of the northern Midland Basin where horizontal drilling activity has increased by 300% since January 2012. Based on industry data, we believe the Permian Basin offers some of the most attractive returns among our nation’s producing oil and natural gas plays.









Contiguous acreage position with high degree of operational control.








The vast majority of our acreage is located on contiguous blocks in the core of the Northern Midland Basin. We believe this large, contiguous acreage position allows us to optimize our horizontal and vertical development programs to maximize our resource recovery on a per section basis, and thus our returns. In particular, our contiguous acreage blocks allow us the flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion techniques, primarily the length of our horizontal laterals, in order to optimize our well results, drilling costs and returns. As the operator of approximately 95% of our net acreage, we retain the ability to adjust our development program, including the selection of specific drilling locations, the timing of the development and the drilling and completion techniques used to efficiently develop our significant resource base. This operating control also enables us to exchange data with other offset operators, which we believe contributes to reducing the risks associated with drilling the multiple horizontal zones of our acreage.









Significant horizontal drilling experience in multiple pay zones in the Midland Basin.








Our horizontal drilling experience targeting multiple pay zones in the Midland Basin provides us a competitive advantage in these areas. Our initial horizontal focus was on the Wolfcamp B formation in Midland County. We were among the first operators in the core of the Midland Basin to successfully drill and complete a horizontal well in the Wolfcamp B formation. In addition, we believe we were the first operator to successfully drill and complete a horizontal well targeting the Lower Spraberry shale in the Permian Basin. We are currently drilling what we believe will be the first horizontal well targeting the Middle Spraberry and the first operator to successfully drill and complete the first horizontal well in the Middle Sprayberry shale. We recently completed several wells in the Wolfcamp A Formation on our properties and early well results have been among the best wells we have completed on our properties. Additionally, our technical team has been drilling horizontal wells in North America since the early 1990s and applies this decades-long experience when drilling our target zones in the Midland Basin.









Multi-year horizontal drilling inventory.








We have identified a multi-year inventory of horizontal drilling locations that we believe provide attractive growth and return opportunities. Based on our initial horizontal drilling results and those of other operators in our area to date, combined with our interpretation of various geologic and engineering data, as of May 2015, we had identified over 1,300 net horizontal drilling locations on our acreage based on five wells per 640 acres for short laterals and five wells per 960 acres for long laterals. These locations exist across most of our acreage blocks and in multiple target zones. We also believe that as we execute our horizontal drilling program, we will identify additional horizontal drilling locations. Additionally, we believe our acreage could be prospective for horizontal drilling of the Clearfork, Jo Mill, Dean, Strawn, Atoka, Mississippian and Devonian formations.









Experienced, incentivized and proven management team.








We believe that the experience of our management and technical teams in horizontal drilling and completions will help reduce the execution risk associated with unconventional drilling. We believe the significant collective experience of our management and technical teams has enabled us to recognize the potential in the core of the Midland Basin and to assemble a portfolio of assets that has been, and we believe will continue to be, highly productive. Further, our executive team has extensive experience in identifying acquisition targets and evaluating resource potential through its involvement in successfully building and selling several companies that executed acquisitions and divestitures as part of their growth strategy. We believe this significant experience identifying and closing acquisitions and divestitures will help us identify additional attractive acquisition opportunities in the future. Our management team has a meaningful economic interest in us, which we believe will provide significant incentives to grow the value of our business for the benefit of all stockholders.

Style Scores:



F Value | B Growth | F Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
