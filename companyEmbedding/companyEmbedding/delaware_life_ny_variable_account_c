Some people take advantage of annuities to grow savings, while others use them to generate guaranteed “paychecks” for life. Regardless of what you use them for, annuities enable people to enter retirement with confidence—especially when they’re backed by the financial strength of New York Life. Explore our top options, and let us help find the right annuity for you.




Try Tax-Deferred Growth in the Market
Variable annuities can help you make tax-deferred investments in the market. You can also purchase protection and create a legacy.*





See How to Steadily Grow Your Savings
Fixed annuities provide a guaranteed interest rate to help your savings grow safely, no matter what happens in the market.*





Convert Your Savings into Secure Income, for Life
With Guaranteed Income Annuities, you can have regular “paychecks” after you stop working. So you receive income for life, no matter what.*  










You work hard to save for retirement. An annuity can make your savings work just as hard for you.










Good news: People are living longer than ever before. So your retirement savings need to last longer than ever before. Also keep in mind that traditional sources of retirement income like Social Security are often inadequate. So putting plans in place for now and later is essential, and annuities can be a powerful tool. With greater security, an annuity can help make your savings last longer than they otherwise could.



Annuities are a way to pay yourself forward.
Typically, when you purchase an annuity contract, you make a payment in exchange for a future stream of income. If you’re still saving for retirement, know that the earlier you save the more retirement income you’ll likely have to enjoy in the future. If you’re already retired and want to start receiving income immediately, you could make a one-time payment to fund the annuity. Or you can have the flexibility to make payments over time, which will be based on the amount you wish to receive in retirement. 
Your income is up to you: what, when, and how.
Some annuities provide income right away. Others set you up to receive income in the future. Buying an annuity now lets you secure your income when you need it, whether that’s today or years away. (Typically, the longer you wait, the more your savings will work for you and the more monthly income you’ll receive.)
The risk you want and the results you need.
A Guaranteed Income Annuity lets you convert your savings into a secure source of income that’s guaranteed to last the rest of your lifetime—so you can be sure you’ll never run out of money in retirement. 
A Fixed Annuity offers tax-deferred growth based on a guaranteed fixed interest rate, while a Variable Annuity allows you to pursue greater growth potential by investing in the market. Some variable annuities offer certain guarantees*, for an extra fee, to help ensure your investment is more protected from the market’s possible downside. 
What if you need to cancel?
Most fixed and variable annuities have a provision that allows you to cancel or surrender your policy. Surrender charges do apply on many products, typically between one and nine years, but they generally decrease every year during the surrender-charge period. Each annuity contract we offer is different, so make sure to read the terms carefully and work with a financial professional who understands the specifics of these products.
How could an annuity work for you? 
Contact expert and let us help you determine your best options.
 
New York Life annuities are issued by New York Life Insurance Company and New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC) (a Delaware corporation) a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company. Available in jurisdictions where approved.

ITEM 28.  PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH THE DEPOSITOR OR THE REGISTRANT
No person is directly or indirectly controlled by the Registrant.  The Registrant is a separate account of Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Company of New York, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life of Canada (U.S.) Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada - U.S. Operations Holdings, Inc., which is in turn a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada.
The organization chart of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada is filed as Exhibit 13 to the Registration Statement on Form N-4 of Keyport Variable Account A, File Nos. 333-114126, 811-07543, filed April 1, 2004.
None of the companies listed in such Exhibit 13 is a subsidiary of the Registrant; therefore, the only financial statements being filed are those of Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Company of New York.

ITEM 29.  INDEMNIFICATION
Article 5, Section 5.6 of the by-laws of Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Company of New York, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit A(6)(b) to the Registration Statement of Sun Life (N.Y.) Variable Account C on Form N-8B-2 (File No. 811-4440), provides for indemnification of directors, officers and employees of Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Company of New York.
Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Company of New York pursuant to the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, or otherwise, Sun Life (N.Y.) has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by Sun Life (N.Y.) of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, controlling person of Sun Life (N.Y.) in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, Sun Life (N.Y.) will, unless in the opinion of their counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court
of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by them is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
ITEM 30.  PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITERS
<R>
Clarendon Insurance Agency, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.), acts as general distributor for the Registrant, Sun Life of Canada (U.S.) Variable Accounts C, D, E, G, H and I, Keyport Variable Account A, KMA Variable Account, Keyport Variable Account I, KBL Variable Account A, KBL Variable Annuity Account, Sun Life (N.Y.)

held for the election of directors at such date, time and place, either within  
or without the State of New York, as may be designated by the Charter or by     
resolution of the Board of Directors from time to time. Any other proper

Section 1.3 Notice of Meetings. Written notice of annual or special 
meetings stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a 
special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall  
be given not less than ten nor more than fifty days before the date of the      
meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.                   

   Section 1.4 Adjournments. Any annual or special meeting of stockholders
may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and 
notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place    
thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. Any     
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting may be        
transacted at the adjourned meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty 
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned  
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at the meeting.                                         

     Section 1.5 Quorum. Except where otherwise provided by law or the Charter
or these by-laws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled

to time in the

     Section 1.6 Organization. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over
by the Chairman, or in his or her absence by the Vice Chairman, or in his or her

  Section 1.7 Voting; Proxies; Vote Required by Action. Unless otherwise
provided in the Charter, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of    
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote upon the matter in question for each 
share of stock having voting power held by such stockholder. Each stockholder   
entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent  
to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or
persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted  
or acted upon after eleven months from its date unless the proxy provides for a 
longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it (1) states that 

14

P-->EX-619th Page of 40TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 19th
it is irrevocable and (2) is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to      
support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not   
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the 
Secretary an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed  
proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by   
written ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors unless the holders of a  
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon present in person or
by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. At all meetings of stockholders for
the election of directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to 
elect. All other elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law
or the Charter or these by-laws, be decided by the vote of the holders of a     
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting.                                            

   Section 1.8 Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of 
or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to     
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or to receive 
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or to 
exercise any

rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the     
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, 
a record date, which shall not be more than fifty nor less than ten days before 
the date of such meeting, nor more than fifty days prior to the taking of any   
other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining   
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall
be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is
given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day on which the
meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to   
express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior 
action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the    
first written consent is expressed; and (3) the record date for determining     
stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day 
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A       
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a   
meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

  Section 1.9 List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The Secretary shall
prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a     
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in  
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number  
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to
the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,     
during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the  
meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,     
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so      
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be 
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time    
thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Upon the willful
neglect or refusal of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for   
the election of directors, such directors shall be ineligible for election to   
any office at such meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to   
stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or  
the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders.

taken, shall be signed by the holders of all outstanding stock.

this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or         
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which

Statements



A New Account Statement for Your Delaware Life Annuity
In October, Delaware Life introduced a new service support model for our annuity business. This change included moving account records to a new administrative system. As a result, the look and content of your quarterly variable annuity account statements will be changing, beginning with the year-end 2015 statement that will be mailed to you in January 2016. The new statement has been streamlined and includes what we believe is the essential information for understanding and managing your annuity.
To help you become familiar with your new statement and how to find more information online, please use these tools:








A Guide to Your New Delaware Life Annuity Statement



Frequently Asked Questions
I just received my quarterly statement. Why does it look different?
As you may know, Delaware Life recently introduced a new administrative support model for our annuity business. This new model included changes to our contact information, as well as our Account Access website and outgoing correspondence to our customers. Along with those changes, you will now see your Quarterly Statement information presented in a new format.

Will this be the way my statement looks in the future?
Although there is no time frame on the enhancements, we are actively working on building more content into our future variable annuity statements to enhance the information and details specific to your contract.

I used to be able to see my living benefit and death benefit details on my quarterly statement. Why is that no longer available?
We are actively working on building more content into our future statements. However, at this time, living benefit and death benefit information is not available on the statement.
Your living benefit and death benefit information is available on our Account Access site. If you have not already done so, please register on the Delaware Life Account Access site to view your account details. For immediate questions regarding your living benefit or death benefit, or for information you cannot locate on the Account Access site, please call one of our Customer Service representatives and they will be happy to assist you.

My statement used to list my beneficiary details. Where can I find this information?
You may log onto our Account Access website to access your beneficiary details. On the Account Access site, within the “People” tab, you will find all Primary and Contingent beneficiary information and percentages.

I used to get my rate of return on my statement. Why is it gone and how do I get that now?
As part of the new administrative support model for our annuity business, the personal rate of return is no longer available. Although we are unable to provide your personal rate of return, you may access your fund performance details on our Account Access website.

My year-end statement used to tell me what my Required Minimum Distribution value was, as well as my next year’s RMD amount. Where can I find that information?
As a result of changes to outgoing correspondence, this information will now be sent through a separate mailing that outlines your Required Minimum Distribution basis value and your current year’s RMD amount. This letter will be postmarked no later than January 31, 2016.

My previous statement provided me with my cost basis. Why can I not get it on this one?
Going forward we will not be displaying a breakdown of your cost basis on your quarterly statements. However, one of our Customer Service representatives will be happy to provide you with the cost basis for your non-qualified contract.

My transactions used to be broken out by subaccount, and now it is only showing the total transaction. Why?
By logging-on to the Delaware Life Account Access site, you will be able to view transaction detail at the sub account level by dollar amount. If you require additional information regarding a specific transaction, such as units purchased and sold, please call our Customer Service team.

I used to receive e-delivery of my statements. How do I re-establish e-delivery of my account statement?
E-Delivery will be offered and available to clients by the end of 2015, but you will have to re-elect this service once you’ve registered on the Account Access site. Until you do so, you will continue to receive mailed documents.
Financial Advisors must register for account access to receive their client statements.
You can log onto the Delaware Life Account Access site or we will be happy to assist you with registering your account today if you call our Customer Service team.

I rebalance my portfolio each quarter, why does the transaction history look different?
The values displayed are the net result of all money/units moved between all funds in order to rebalance to the original percentages you have allocated. In order to view each of the funds, and the corresponding dollar amounts moved between each, please log onto the Delaware Life Account Access site.

Your Annuity Contract is Secure and Unchanged
The terms, guarantees and values of your annuity contract remain unaffected, as does our commitment to you. Your contract is backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Delaware Life Insurance Company, a leading U.S. provider of annuity and life insurance products. The Delaware Life group of companies is a financially strong, well-capitalized organization committed to serving our clients as prudent financial stewards, with more than 340,000 in-force annuity and life insurance policies representing approximately $36 billion in assets under management.1

Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index AnnuityAmericans are living longer than ever thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles. This is great news, but longer lifespans mean extra years in retirement. You may even spend more years in retirement than you have at work. You may need to plan for more financial resources to have the retirement lifestyle you envision.
 
Assured Income 7SM Fixed Index Annuity is a flexible and straightforward solution built to provide you with guaranteed lifetime income. Your annuity gives you the choice of simple crediting options to grow your money and competitive guaranteed income you can depend upon and plan around. Assured Income 7SM offers an excellent balance of predictable guaranteed income and competitive accumulation.
 
Key Benefits
Assured Income 7SM gives you sought-after guaranteed lifetime income and simple, attractive crediting options to grow your money.
 
Guaranteed Principal to Protect Your Retirement MoneyUnlike other retirement products, a fixed index annuity is not an investment in individual securities. So when the markets do poorly, your account is guaranteed to not drop in value. Both your investment and any interest it earns are protected from principal loss, by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company.1
 

1If you withdraw your assets, your principal may be reduced by withdrawal and surrender charges, rider fees and a market value adjustment.


Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suite Your NeedsStraightforward options to grow your savings:
 

S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time.
 
For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.
 

The Standard and Poor’s 500® (“S&P 500®”) is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC or its affiliates (“SPDJI”) and has been licensed for use by Delaware Life Insurance Company (“Delaware Life”). Standard & Poor’s® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”); Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”); and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and sublicensed for certain purposes by Delaware Life. Assured Income 7SM is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by SPDJI, Dow Jones, S&P, their respective affiliates and none of such parties make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in such product(s) nor do they have any liability for any errors, omissions, or interruptions of the S&P 500®.


Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit with Fee Refund Feature
Assured Income 7SM comes with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit that provides income for the owner and spouse (if elected), even if the account (cash) value should go to zero. The benefit base will grow by a guaranteed 9% per year (roll-up bonus credit) for 10 years (roll-up bonus period) for an annual cost. The benefit base is the amount on which your lifetime income is calculated. The benefit base is not a cash or surrender value or death benefit and is not available as a lump sum. This feature means you’ll know what your lifetime income will be, so you can make plans with real information.
 
Fee Refund Feature
 
The guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit also includes a unique fee refund feature. After 10 years (or less if the annuity’s owner dies) 100% of rider fees paid (within the last 10 contract years) are eligible for a refund if:
 

Lifetime income is never started, and 
No withdrawals of any kind (including RMDs) are taken. 


Bailout Endorsement
Assured Income 7SM comes with a “bailout” provision, that provides full or partial withdrawals from the contract without a surrender charge or market value adjustment if, the renewal cap for the S&P 500® 1-year point-to-point strategy is below the bailout cap rate. A cap is the maximum interest your FIA can earn in a year. No allocation to the Index account is required to receive this bailout protection. This benefit is provided to the owner at no cost. See the disclosure statement for more details.

  
Delaware Life Insurance Company is authorized to transact business in all states except New York, as well as in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  

For more information about Assured Income 7SM,   contact us  or download our Product Brochure or Product Profile (Download Adobe Acrobat Reader). Product availability and marketing material may vary by state. Ask your financial professional to help you get started.

Retirement Stages 7® Fixed Index AnnuityA long retirement could afford you the time to do the things you never had the chance to do while you were working, raising a family and paying a mortgage. You know that you’ll need the means to realize that goal, so you’re looking for the opportunity to continuously grow your savings while protecting it from market losses.
 
The unique features of Delaware Life’s Retirement Stages 7® Fixed Index Annuity give you conservative income potential, including optional riders that provide guaranteed lifetime income and a return of your premium payments free of surrender charges.1 You have a choice of index options available only from Delaware Life.

Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suit Your NeedsChoose from an unusual, well thought-out selection of investment options and crediting methods designed to meet your evolving needs and goals:
 

CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure between the CROCI Sectors Index, which invests in the 10 most undervalued stocks from each of the three most undervalued global industry sectors, and a cash component, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure across equities, gold, interest rates and cash based on their trailing nine month performance, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

 
You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time. For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.
 

This Product (the “Product”) is not sponsored, endorsed, managed, sold or promoted by Deutsche Bank AG (DB AG) or any subsidiary or affiliate of DB AG.  The Deutsche Bank Indices are the exclusive property of DB AG.  “Deutsche Bank” and “CROCI” are proprietary marks of DB AG and its affiliates that have been licensed for certain uses and purposes to Delaware Life Insurance Company (DLIC).  Neither DB AG, CROCI, nor any affiliate of DB AG, nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Deutsche Bank Indices: (1) is acting in a fiduciary or product management capacity or providing any endorsement of the Product or investment advice of any kind; (2) has any obligation to take the needs of DLIC, the sponsor of the Product, or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Deutsche Bank Indices; (3) is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Product; (4) WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK INDICES OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN OR THE ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF THE PRODUCT.  The CROCI Indices have been built on the premise that the CROCI Economic P/E is an effective indicator of inherent value. This premise may not be correct, and prospective investors must form their own view of the CROCI methodology and evaluate whether CROCI is appropriate for them. Please see the Disclosure Statement and Annuity Illustration for more information about the Deutsche Bank Indices and the Product.
Obligations to make payments under the Product are solely the obligation of Delaware Life Insurance Company and are not the responsibility of DB AG.  The selection of one or more of the Deutsche Bank Indices as a crediting option under the Product does not obligate Delaware Life Insurance Company or DB AG to invest annuity payments in the components of any of the Deutsche Bank Indices.
The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee.
While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

 

There are risks associated with the CROCI methodology, the CROCI Sectors III Index and the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control (“CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC”) Index:

No assurance can be given that the CROCI methodology will be successful at identifying undervalued companies;
There is no assurance that (i) the three industry sectors chosen will outperform the other industry sectors or (ii) the 30 chosen stocks will outperform the remaining stocks in the component indices;
Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level;
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.


 

There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.


 

The Standard and Poor’s 500® (“S&P 500®”) is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC or its affiliates (“SPDJI”) and has been licensed for use by Delaware Life Insurance Company (“Delaware Life”). Standard & Poor’s® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”); Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”); and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and sublicensed for certain purposes by Delaware Life. Retirement Stages 7® is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by SPDJI, Dow Jones, S&P, their respective affiliates and none of such parties make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in such product(s) nor do they have any liability for any errors, omissions, or interruptions of the S&P 500®.


Options for Lifetime IncomeTake your retirement income as you choose:
 

Free withdrawal amounts
Periodic withdrawals
Annuity payments
Guaranteed withdrawals with an optional, affordable Stacked Accumulation Income Rider® (STAIR®) provides guaranteed lifetime income for you and your spouse, even if your Account Value should go to zero.


Return of Premium RiderThe optional Return of Premium Rider is available for an additional fee. You may surrender at any time prior to the Annuity Date – without surrender charges – and receive at least 100% of the premiums you paid (minus applicable prior withdrawals).
Access to Indexes Sponsored By a Global LeaderAccess the indexes sponsored by a leading global provider of financial services when you choose the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index and Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index. Founded in 1870 and headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Deutsche Bank is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in the world. As of December 31, 2014, the firm manages $2.1 trillion in assets and has more than 90,000 global employees, operating in 71 countries around the world. The company also offers the sales, trading and structuring of a wide range of financial markets’ products including index-based swaps, notes and certificates.
 

“Deutsche Bank” means Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliated companies, as context requires. Deutsche Bank does not render legal or tax advice and information in this communication should not be regarded as such.


Bailout EndorsementRetirement Stages 7® comes with a “bailout” provision, which provides full or partial withdrawals from the contract without a surrender charge or market value adjustment if the renewal cap for the S&P 500® 1-year point-to-point strategy is below the bailout cap rate. A cap is the maximum interest your FIA can earn in a year. No allocation to the Index account is required to receive this bailout protection. This benefit is provided to the owner at no cost.

Both your investment and any interest it earns are protected from principal loss, by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company.1
 

1If you withdraw your assets, your principal may be reduced by withdrawal and surrender charges, rider fees and a market value adjustment.


Choice of Indexes and Crediting Methods to Suit Your NeedsChoose from an unusual, well thought-out selection of investment options and crediting methods designed to meet your evolving needs and goals:
 

CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure between the CROCI Sectors Index, which invests in the 10 most undervalued stocks from each of the three most undervalued global industry sectors, and a cash component, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index – Sponsored by Deutsche Bank and dynamically allocates exposure across equities, gold, interest rates and cash based on their trailing nine month performance, using a volatility control mechanism to help limit overall volatility.
S&P 500® Index – Widely regarded as a premier benchmark for the domestic stock market.
Fixed Account – Credited with an interest rate that is current on the date the investment is effective.

You may elect more than one strategy and on each contract anniversary, you may reallocate your account value among the options available at that time. For more detailed information on the index options and the crediting methods available, please see our Product Brochure.
 


This  Product (the “Product”) is not sponsored, endorsed, managed, sold or promoted by Deutsche Bank AG (DB AG) or any subsidiary or affiliate of DB AG.  The Deutsche Bank Indices are the exclusive property of DB AG.  “Deutsche Bank” and “CROCI” are proprietary marks of DB AG and its affiliates that have been licensed for certain uses and purposes to Delaware Life Insurance Company (DLIC).  Neither DB AG, CROCI, nor any affiliate of DB AG, nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the Deutsche Bank Indices: (1) is acting in a fiduciary or product management capacity or providing any endorsement of the Product or investment advice of any kind; (2) has any obligation to take the needs of DLIC, the sponsor of the Product, or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the Deutsche Bank Indices; (3) is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Product; (4) WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE DEUTSCHE BANK INDICES OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN OR THE ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING OR TRADING OF THE PRODUCT.  The CROCI Indices have been built on the premise that the CROCI Economic P/E is an effective indicator of inherent value. This premise may not be correct, and prospective investors must form their own view of the CROCI methodology and evaluate whether CROCI is appropriate for them. Please see the Disclosure Statement and Annuity Illustration for more information about the Deutsche Bank Indices and the Product.
Obligations to make payments under the Product are solely the obligation of Delaware Life Insurance Company and are not the responsibility of DB AG.  The selection of one or more of the Deutsche Bank Indices as a crediting option under the Product does not obligate Delaware Life Insurance Company or DB AG to invest annuity payments in the components of any of the Deutsche Bank Indices.
The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee.
While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

 

There are risks associated with the CROCI methodology, the CROCI Sectors III Index and the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control (“CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC”) Index:

No assurance can be given that the CROCI methodology will be successful at identifying undervalued companies;
There is no assurance that (i) the three industry sectors chosen will outperform the other industry sectors or (ii) the 30 chosen stocks will outperform the remaining stocks in the component indices;
Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level; 
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.



There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.

A cap is the maximum interest your FIA can earn in a year. No allocation to the Index account is required to receive this bailout protection. This benefit is provided to the owner at no cost.

While volatility controls may result in less fluctuation in rates of return as compared to indices without volatility controls, they may also reduce the overall rate of return as compared to products not subject to volatility controls.

 

There are risks associated with the CROCI methodology, the CROCI Sectors III Index and the CROCI Sectors III USD 5.5% Volatility Control (“CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC”) Index:

No assurance can be given that the CROCI methodology will be successful at identifying undervalued companies;
There is no assurance that (i) the three industry sectors chosen will outperform the other industry sectors or (ii) the 30 chosen stocks will outperform the remaining stocks in the component indices;
Even if the strategy of the CROCI Sectors III Index is successful and it outperforms the component indices, the level of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may decline;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to a maximum notional exposure of 100% to the CROCI Sectors III Index and will not adjust its exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index by more than 10% on any day, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may not be able to maintain a fixed target volatility level of 5.5%;
If the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors III Index is less than 5.5%, the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC may have a 100% exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index, but a target volatility level less than 5.5%;
Because the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC’s exposure to the CROCI Sectors III Index on each day is calculated based on the historical realized volatility the CROCI Sectors III Index, the realized volatility of the CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC could differ significantly from the target volatility level; 
The CROCI Sectors 5.5% VC is subject to currency exchange rate risk; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, may adjust the Index and/or its components in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.



There are risks associated with the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index (the “Index”) and the Deutsche Bank Momentum Asset Allocator Index (the “Momentum Index”):

The Momentum Asset Allocator 5.5% Volatility Control Index is calculated on an excess return basis reflecting the weighted performance of the Index constituents in excess of the performance of the Deutsche Bank Momentum Money Market Index. In addition, the Index also reflects the daily deduction of a 0.25% per annum fee;
On any day, the actual realized volatility of the Index could be significantly higher or lower than the target volatility of 5.5%;
There is no assurance that the strategy of the Momentum Index will be successful, and it may decline in value even if successful. Past performance of the Index is not indicative of future results; and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the sponsor and calculation agent of the Index, the Momentum Index and the Momentum Index’s underlying indices, may adjust such indices in a way that affects their respective levels and may have conflicts of interest.
