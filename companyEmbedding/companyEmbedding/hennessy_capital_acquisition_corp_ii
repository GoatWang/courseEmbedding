Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. Announces Agreement To Acquire Blue Bird


NASDAQ‐Listed Public Company to be Re‐Named Blue Bird Corporation and Managed by Blue Bird’s Existing Management Team
HOUSTON, TEXAS AND FORT VALLEY, GEORGIA – September 22, 2014 – Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: HCAC, HCACU, HCACW) (“HCAC”) today announced it has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of School Bus Holdings Inc., an indirect parent company of Blue Bird Corporation (“Blue Bird” or the “Company”), from The Traxis Group B.V. (“Traxis”), which is majority owned by funds affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (“Cerberus”).
Blue Bird is the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses, with more than 550,000 buses sold since its formation in 1927 and nearly 200,000 buses in operation today. In addition,
Blue Bird is the fastest‐growing major school bus manufacturer in North America, with market share increasing in each of the past four years, and is the market leader in alternative‐fuel applications with its propane‐powered and compressed natural gas‐powered school buses.
“HCAC is extremely pleased to partner with Blue Bird’s management and Cerberus to introduce Blue Bird to the public markets,” said Daniel J. Hennessy, Chairman and CEO of HCAC. “We are acquiring an iconic American brand with an 87‐year history of innovation and product leadership led by a superb management team at a very attractive price. We believe Blue Bird fits squarely into our stated investment criteria, and that as a public company, Blue Bird will have the capital structure, ownership support, operating flexibility and enhanced public image to achieve its maximum potential.”
Chan Galbato, CEO of Cerberus Operations and Advisory Company, LLC, and non‐executive Chairman of Blue Bird, stated, “Blue Bird is a terrific, well‐run company with great people and products and we are thrilled to continue our longstanding relationship with them, as Cerberus will retain a significant ownership interest in the company. We look forward to sharing in the significant value‐creation opportunity that Blue Bird offers, in partnership with HCAC, Blue Bird’s management and our new stockholders.”
The Company will continue to be led by current Blue Bird President and CEO Phil Horlock, who added, “We are very excited for Blue Bird to become a public company by partnering with HCAC and delighted that Cerberus will remain a major stockholder. Under Cerberus’ stewardship, our Blue Bird team has transformed the business through launching exciting new products and features, improving quality and cost structure, and growing sales and market share. We believe this transaction will enable us to maintain our growth momentum with our exceptional workforce building the world’s finest school bus.”
Transaction Details
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the aggregate equity purchase price payable at the closing of the proposed transaction will be $255 million comprised of cash and shares of HCAC common stock. In addition, HCAC will assume approximately $235 million of Blue Bird’s existing indebtedness. The purchase price consists of (i) an estimated $140 million in cash (assuming no HCAC stockholder redemptions) and (ii) the issuance of 11.5 million shares of HCAC common stock (subject to increase if the cash paid to Traxis is lower than $140 million). The cash component is expected to be funded by the cash in HCAC’s trust account established in connection with its initial public offering (the “IPO”) and the issuance of $40 million of convertible preferred stock to certain investors in a private placement. Additionally, HCAC has received a commitment from an investor to purchase up to $10 million of HCAC common stock through (i) open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties, (ii) a private placement with consummation to occur concurrently with the closing of the transaction, or (iii) a combination thereof, in order to ensure sufficient funds to finance the cash component of the purchase price.
The purchase agreement contemplates that the new board of directors of the combined company will consist of six members of Blue Bird’s existing board of directors (including Chan Galbato, who will serve as Chairman of the Board, Phil Horlock, who will continue to serve as CEO, and Dev Kapadia, a Cerberus Managing Director), two current members of HCAC’s board of directors (Daniel J. Hennessy, who will serve as Vice Chairman of the Board, and Kevin Charlton) and one newly designated individual.
At the closing of the proposed transaction, 12,125,000 of the 23,625,000 currently outstanding HCAC warrants will be exchanged for a total of 1,212,500 shares of HCAC common stock, through a combination of (i) a negotiated exchange with HCAC’s sponsor and (ii) an exchange offer by HCAC to exchange up to 50% of the outstanding HCAC warrants issued to public stockholders in the IPO for shares of HCAC common stock. The terms of the sponsor warrant exchange and public warrant exchange offer will be described in HCAC’s proxy statement relating to the proposed transaction, which HCAC will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). HCAC’s exchange offer for its public warrants will be made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including an offer to exchange and related materials) that HCAC intends to file with the SEC.
The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals, and is expected to close promptly following HCAC’s special stockholders’ meeting to approve the transaction. Upon consummation of the transaction, it is anticipated that Traxis will be the combined company’s principal stockholder, owning approximately 42.4% of HCAC’s outstanding common stock, and HCAC’s existing stockholders will retain an ownership interest of approximately 57.6% (assuming no HCAC stockholder redemptions). It is expected that the combined company’s securities will continue to be listed on NASDAQ.
HCAC was advised on the transaction by BMO Capital Markets Corp., Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Incorporated and XMS Capital Partners, LLC as financial advisors with Sidley Austin LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP as legal counsel. Cerberus, Traxis and Blue Bird were advised by Evercore as financial advisor with Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP as legal counsel.
The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive agreement relating to the transaction, a copy of which will be filed by HCAC with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8‐K.

HOUSTON and ADDISON, Texas, Dec. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. II (NASDAQ:   HCAC, HCACU, HCACW) ("HCAC") and Daseke, Inc. ("Daseke") today announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement. This proposed transaction will allow Daseke to become a Nasdaq-listed public company. 








Daseke is a leading consolidator of the open deck freight market in North America. Since being founded in 2009, Daseke has grown revenue both organically and through mergers from $30 million to $679 million in 2015, representing a compound annual growth rate of 68%. Daseke's family of companies has become what it believes to be the largest owner of open deck equipment and the second largest open deck transportation and logistics solutions company in North America. Being a public company will allow Daseke to 1) add more outstanding companies to the Daseke family, building what it believes to be the premier open-deck trucking company in North America, 2) provide stock ownership plans for all employees and 3) support organic growth and to ensure one of the most modern, efficient and safest fleets in the industry.
"HCAC is extremely pleased to partner with Daseke's management team to oversee the continued growth of the company through access to the capital markets," said Daniel J. Hennessy, Chairman and CEO of HCAC. "Daseke is an ideal target for our investment vehicle, which is focused exclusively on best-in-class, industrial growth companies.  We believe our business combination with the Daseke Team of Teams will benefit all shareholders and enable the company to accelerate its consolidation of the open deck freight sector." 
Daseke will continue to be led by current Chairman, President and CEO Don Daseke, who stated, "We are excited to have HCAC join our Daseke family as we become a Nasdaq-listed public company. HCAC shares our philosophy of investing in people. We believe this formidable combination will enable us to continue to add more outstanding open deck companies to the Daseke family. We are the largest owner and operator focused on this very fragmented, $133 billion a year, open deck transportation market, of which we believe we have less than 1% of the market share. We believe Daseke has the most experienced management team in the open deck and specialized transportation industry, and we are excited for what we see as an amazing opportunity to continue our growth through working daily to achieve operational excellence and by adding quality carriers to our family."
Transaction Details
HCAC will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Daseke in an all-stock merger transaction.  The proposed transaction will introduce Daseke as a publicly traded company, with an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $702 million. In connection with the merger, HCAC will change its name to Daseke, Inc. and apply to continue to list its common stock and warrants on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbols "DSKE" and "DSKEW," respectively. 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, the aggregate consideration payable upon closing will be $626 million, consisting entirely of newly issued shares of HCAC common stock at a value of $10.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments for Daseke's cash, indebtedness, unpaid income taxes and unpaid transaction expenses and the repurchase of shares held by certain existing Daseke stockholders.   The merger agreement also contains an earn-out provision through which HCAC may issue up to 15 million additional shares of HCAC common stock to existing Daseke stockholders for the achievement of specified Adjusted EBITDA targets and share price thresholds for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019.
HCAC has secured all the required financing to complete the proposed transaction and related refinancing, including fully committed debt and equity financings as follows:

$350.0 million in new term loan credit facilities committed by Credit Suisse and UBS Investment Bank; 
$70.0 million in new asset-based revolving (ABL) credit facility committed by PNC Bank, National Association; 
$65.0 million of HCAC convertible preferred stock committed to be sold in a private placement with certain investors; and 
$35.0 million of HCAC common stock backstop commitments from certain investors to purchase (to the extent requested by HCAC) up to $35.0 million of shares of HCAC common stock, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, in order to backstop potential redemptions by HCAC's public stockholders. 

Additional information about the proposed transaction and related financing transactions will be described in HCAC's preliminary proxy statement relating to the merger, which HCAC will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
Upon completion of the proposed transaction, HCAC Chairman and CEO Daniel J. Hennessy and President, COO and director Kevin Charlton will join the Daseke board of directors, which will consist of seven members, including Daseke Chairman and CEO Don Daseke and Executive Vice President and CFO Scott Wheeler, as well as three additional independent directors who serve on the Daseke board.
The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder approvals and the receipt of proceeds from the proposed debt and equity financing activities, and is expected to close promptly following HCAC's special meeting of stockholders to approve the proposed transaction. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, it is anticipated that Daseke management will own approximately 50% of the combined company common stock (assuming redemptions of approximately 67%).  The parties expect the merger will be completed in the first quarter of 2017.
HCAC was advised on the transaction by Stifel, UBS Investment Bank, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., BMO Capital Markets and XMS Capital Partners, LLC, with Sidley Austin LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP as legal counsel.  Daseke was advised by Cowen and Company with Vinson & Elkins LLP as legal counsel.  
The description of the proposed transaction is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, a copy of which will be filed by HCAC with the SEC as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8‐K.
Conference Call Tomorrow, December 23, 2016 at 7:30 a.m. Central time, the management of HCAC and Daseke will host an investor conference call to discuss the proposed transaction.  Interested investors may participate in the call by dialing (844) 358-9181 and refer to audience passcode 44991725.

USI is a leading provider of installation, construction and distribution services to the residential and commercial construction markets in the United States, with a national platform consisting of 43 locations serving customers in 13 states. USI believes it is the third largest insulation installer in the U.S. based on revenue and maintains the first or second market position in more than 50% of its local markets based on estimated permits issued.  USI benefits by having a national scale, long-standing vendor relationships and a diverse customer base that includes production and custom homebuilders, multi-family and commercial contractors and homeowners. “HCAC is extremely pleased to introduce USI to the public markets,” said Daniel J. Hennessy, Chairman and CEO of HCAC. “USI is a truly differentiated building products company with an industry-leading platform led by an exceptional management team.  We believe that the USI’s established presence in high-growth construction markets when combined with strategic acquisitions will lead to sustained revenue growth and profitability for our stockholders.” The combined company will be led by current USI President and CEO, Bill Varner, who added, “Today is an exciting day for USI.  As a public company, we will be better positioned to grow our product and service offerings, make accretive acquisitions and open branches in new markets.  We are thrilled to have Dan and HCAC as partners.” Transaction Details Under the terms of the merger agreement dated as of April 1, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), the aggregate merger consideration is $348.5 million, subject to certain adjustments.  HCAC will pay the total merger consideration with a combination of cash and newly issued shares of common stock.  The cash consideration will be funded through a combination of (i) cash held in HCAC’s trust account after any redemptions of HCAC common stock, (ii) cash raised in an anticipated $100.0 million debt financing, and (iii) the net proceeds, if any, received by HCAC from a potential private placement (at HCAC’s option) of up to $35 million of HCAC’s convertible preferred stock to one or more institutional investors.  The stock consideration will equal approximately 7.1 million shares of HCAC common stock, which will result in USI’s stockholders owning approximately 22% of the combined company (assuming no redemptions of HCAC common stock or purchase price adjustments). The Merger Agreement contemplates that the Board of Directors of the combined company will consist of seven members: HCAC’s CEO and Chairman Daniel J. Hennessy, who will serve as Chairman of the Board; Bill Varner, USI’s CEO; current HCAC directors Richard Burns, Kevin Charlton, and Peter Shea; Michael Kestner, the former CFO of BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:STCK); and an additional USI designee.  The transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if applicable) of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and HCAC stockholder approvals and the receipt of proceeds from HCAC’s anticipated debt financing, and is expected to close promptly following HCAC’s special stockholders’ meeting to approve the transaction.  The parties expect the transaction will be completed in the third quarter of 2016. HCAC was advised on the transaction by UBS Investment Bank, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., BMO Capital Markets and XMS Capital Partners, LLC, as financial advisors, Sidley Austin LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, as legal counsel, and with Grant Thornton LLP providing financial due diligence services.  USI was advised by RBC Capital Markets, as financial advisor and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, as legal counsel. The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which will be filed by HCAC with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. Conference Call and Investor Presentation HCAC and USI Management will hold a joint conference call tomorrow, April 5, 2016, to discuss the transaction at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).  The conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-877-407-9039, or for international callers, 1-201-689-8470, and requesting to be joined to the Hennessy Capital-USI conference call.  A replay will be available starting at 7:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on April 5, 2016 and can be accessed by dialing 1-877-870-5176, or for international callers, 1-858-384-5517.  The passcode for the replay is 13634449.  The replay will be available until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on April 19, 2016.

The skinny
Houston’s Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. II (Nasdaq: HCAC, HCACU, HCACW), a so-called “blank check company,” will acquire Addison, Texas-based logistics company Daseke Inc. The deal comes a few months after Hennessy and another company called off a similar deal.

The details
Hennessy will issue new stock at $10 per share to acquire Daseke in a deal valued at approximately $626 million. Hennessy also may issue up to 15 million additional shares to existing Daseke stockholders if certain targets are met for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.
When the deal closes, Hennessy will change its name to Daseke Inc. and apply to continue listing its common stock and warrants on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbols “DSKE” and “DSKEW,” respectively. After the merger, Daseke is expected to be valued at about $702 million. Management is expected to own roughly half of the company, and executives said they will develop a stock-ownership program for their employees.
The future




Daseke’s current leadership team will continue to manage the publicly traded company. The company’s seven-member board will consist of:
Daniel Hennessy, chairman and CEO of Hennessy; Kevin Charlton, president, COO and a director of Hennessy; Don Daseke, chairman, president and CEO of Daseke; Scott Wheeler, executive vice president and CFO of Daseke; and three of Daseke’s independent directors.
The deal will allow Daseke to grow and acquire a larger share of the open deck freight sector. Open-deck trucking firms haul freight that can be seen on flat-beds, and fewer than 30 such companies operate at least 1,000 haulers, the Dallas Business Journal reports. The industry “is open to consolidation,” and Daseke has a pipeline of 24 possible companies to buy after the merger, Wheeler said on a conference call.
The back story
Hennessy is a special purpose acquisition company, also called an SPAC or a blank check company, founded by Daniel Hennessy with the intent of creating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or business combination. In the summer of 2015, Hennessy’s initial public offering raised more than $200 million, including overallotments. Earlier this year, Hennessy and Minnesota-based USI Senior Holdings Inc. called off a similar $348.5 million deal. A reason for the termination was not provided, but the decision was mutual, according to a press release.





 


The back, back story
Hennessy was one of a handful of blank check companies to make headlines last year. Most recently, Gary Hanna’s Houston-based KLR Energy Acquisition Corp. announced in December it would combine with Houston-based Tema Oil and Gas Co., a subsidiary of Baltimore-based Rosemore Inc., to form Rosehill Resources Inc. and take it public. The new company is expected to have an enterprise value of about $445 million.
The players
Stifel, UBS Investment Bank, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., BMO Capital Markets and XMS Capital Partners LLC advised Hennessy, with Sidley Austin LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP as legal counsel. Daseke was advised by Cowen and Co., with Vinson & Elkins LLP as legal counsel.

Closer Look: Daseke Inc.
HQ: Addison, Texas
Founded: 2008
Revenue: $678.8 million in 2015, up 25 percent from $542.7 million in 2014
Top exec: Don Daseke, chairman, president and CEO
What it does: Largest owner of flatbed, open-deck and specialized trucking capacity in North America; offers daily trucking services in 49 U.S. States, Canada and Mexico
Family of companies: Smokey Point, E.W. Wylie, J. Grady Randolph, Central Oregon Truck Co., Lone Star Transportation, Bulldog Hiway Express, Hornady Transportation and The Boyd Cos. — including Boyd Bros. Transportation, WTI Transport and Mid Seven Transportation

HENNESSY CAPITAL ACQUISITION CORP. II AND USI ANNOUNCE MERGER AGREEMENT

April 04 2016 | USI Editor | Company News 


NASDAQ-Listed Public Company to be Re-Named USI Holdings, Inc. and Managed by USI’s Existing Management Team
HOUSTON, TEXAS AND ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA – April 4, 2016 /GlobeNewswire/ – Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. II (NASDAQ: HCAC, HCACU, HCACW) (“HCAC”) and United Subcontractors, Inc. (“USI”) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which HCAC will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of USI Senior Holdings, Inc., the indirect parent company of USI. In connection with the merger, HCAC will change its name to USI Holdings, Inc. and continue to list its common stock and warrants on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the tickers “USI” and “USIW,” respectively.
USI is a leading provider of installation, construction and distribution services to the residential and commercial construction markets in the United States, with a national platform consisting of 43 locations serving customers in 13 states. USI believes it is the third largest insulation installer in the U.S. based on revenue and maintains the first or second market position in more than 50% of its local markets based on estimated permits issued. USI benefits by having a national scale, long-standing vendor relationships and a diverse customer base that includes production and custom homebuilders, multi-family and commercial contractors and homeowners.
“HCAC is extremely pleased to introduce USI to the public markets,” said Daniel J. Hennessy, Chairman and CEO of HCAC. “USI is a truly differentiated building products company with an industry-leading platform led by an exceptional management team. We believe that USI’s established presence in high-growth construction markets when combined with strategic acquisitions will lead to sustained revenue growth and profitability for our stockholders.”
The combined company will be led by current USI President and CEO, Bill Varner, who added, “Today is an exciting day for USI. As a public company, we will be better positioned to grow our product and service offerings, make accretive acquisitions and open branches in new markets. We are thrilled to have Dan and HCAC as partners.”
Transaction Details
Under the terms of the merger agreement dated as of April 1, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), the aggregate merger consideration is $348.5 million, subject to certain adjustments. HCAC will pay the total merger consideration with a combination of cash and newly issued shares of common stock. The cash consideration will be funded through a combination of (i) cash held in HCAC’s trust account after any redemptions of HCAC common stock, (ii) cash raised in an anticipated $100.0 million debt financing, and (iii) the net proceeds, if any, received by HCAC from a potential private placement (at HCAC’s option) of up to $35 million of HCAC’s convertible preferred stock to one or more institutional investors. The stock consideration will equal approximately 7.1 million shares of HCAC common stock, which will result in USI’s stockholders owning approximately 22% of the combined company (assuming no redemptions of HCAC common stock or purchase price adjustments).
The Merger Agreement contemplates that the Board of Directors of the combined company will consist of seven members: HCAC’s CEO and Chairman Daniel J. Hennessy, who will serve as Chairman of the Board; Bill Varner, USI’s CEO; current HCAC directors Richard Burns, Kevin Charlton, and Peter Shea; Michael Kestner, the former CFO of BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: STCK); and an additional USI designee. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if applicable) of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and HCAC stockholder approvals and the receipt of proceeds from HCAC’s anticipated debt financing, and is expected to close promptly following HCAC’s special stockholders’ meeting to approve the transaction. The parties expect the transaction will be completed in the third quarter of 2016.
HCAC was advised on the transaction by UBS Investment Bank, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., BMO Capital Markets and XMS Capital Partners, LLC, as financial advisors, Sidley Austin LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, as legal counsel, and with Grant Thornton LLP providing financial due diligence services. USI was advised by RBC Capital Markets, as financial advisor, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, as legal counsel.
The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which will be filed by HCAC with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Conference Call and Investor Presentation
HCAC and USI Management will hold a joint conference call tomorrow, April 5, 2016, to discuss the transaction at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time). The conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-877-407-9039, or for international callers, 1-201-689-8470, and requesting to be joined to the Hennessy Capital-USI conference call.

 Investment Thesis








Hennessy Capital Industrial Infrastructure and Industrial Growth Investment Thesis
We believe an industrial renaissance is underway in the United States, and that now is the time to invest in the growing trend. The renaissance is fueled by several unquestionable market realities:

Cheap and abundant natural gas and crude oil – This has and will continue to benefit a wide range of U.S. industries across the value chain, from abundant feedstock and affordable energy, to finished goods
The U.S. labor market is stable, skilled, educated, and is increasingly competitive with developing exporter nations, giving the U.S. an advantage over other economies
The U.S. is increasingly competitive on a total landed cost basis when global market logistics, transportation costs and the risks of operating extended global supply chains are calculated

Hennessy Capital’s most recent SPAC investment vehicle is Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp III, (NYSE American: HCAC U) taken public on June 22, 2017, ultimately raising more than $256 million.  For more information on this portfolio company, visit the Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp III page on this site.

A Demonstrable National Infrastructure Deficit
