Testimonials
















JSW has taken a great initiative by adding slag in cement, this gives the product great quality and maximum strength. I prefer every other construction should be using JSW PSC Cement














We are using JSW cement since last 12 months for our site at JBF Petrochemicals Limited, Mangalore. We found the quality of cement supplied is good and we are getting required strength out of it
 














We are using JSW PSC from past three years and are happy with the Quality and strength. Since it is PSC, Heat of Hydration is less.














JSW Cement is very good and in fact has been showing excellent properties. We have been using them for RCC, Foundation, Plastering as well as for all types of applications. For esteemed projects like Green Acres & Harmony we have exclusively used JSW Cement.














All my projects will be built By JSW PSC cement. Our engineers and technicians are happy and fully satisfied with the properties of cement. Especially after 28 days, it kept on gaining strength and reached more than what was expected.














Happy with quality of cement. It reached our required parameters & JSW Cement offers best services in supply.














The team at JSW is very friendly, understanding, and transparent. They support our business objectives and mentor us during tough times. As one of the top performers for JSW Cement, we are quite happy with our journey together and look forward to a long-term relationship.
