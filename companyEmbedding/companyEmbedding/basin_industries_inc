What We Do

Basin Industries Inc. is more than just a 'scrap yard'. We now provide two locations; one in Price, Utah and the other in Vernal, Utah

Many People are unaware that Basin Industries Inc. offers demolition and clean-up services on location. We will do demolition work on oilfield tanks, pipelines, buildings, mines, farms, power plants, etc.

Our Dumpster Service is an efficient way for you to dispose of your scrap metal. We have five hook trucks, two transport trucks, 2 rollback and over 300 roll-off dumpsters that are easily loaded and unloaded. We offer a variety of dumpster sizes to better suit your individual needs.

We have licensed commercial truck scales at both locations, with easy access to weigh any size truck. We also own several small, digital, non ferrous scales.

Basin Industries Inc. is open year round to serve your needs. We buy anything that is metal and we purchase them from you at a current and honest market value. Basin Industries is one of Utah's largest scrap metal recycling and brokers.

Basin Industries has recently moved its location in Vernal, to a 15 acre yard and facility.  It has easy in and out access.

Why We Do It

As a young boy, Scott Bingham (owner), earned a small income by salvaging items that had been thrown away by other people.  He would sell these items, often as scrap, and pocket the cash.  Before long, he realized a second benefit from these salvaging activities: the area from which he took the items was cleaner, nicer, and healthier.  This desire for a neat and healthy planet let him to start his own metal recycling business.
 
In 1993, The company motto stated their purpose:  "Recycling Metal for a Better Community to Build a Better Nation."  This motto is based on Scott Bingham's main philosophy: 'the planet isn't getting any bigger.' Once a piece of metal goes into a landfill, its life is over.  If we can recycle it, it has a new life.  What comes in during one day is processed and sent to the mills.  It is realistic that within three days it's new metal again, instead of using tax dollars to pay for a landfill funeral.'   
 
In 2012, Basin Industries expanded and now has a recycling center in Price, Uah.

Company IntroServicesKey ContactsAbout CompanyBasin Industries Inc. is more than just a 'scrap yard'. We now provide two locations; one in Price, Utah and the other in Vernal, UtahMany People are unaware that Basin Industries Inc. offers demolition and clean-up services on location. We will do demolition work on oilfield tanks, pipelines, buildings, mines, farms, power plants, etc.Our Dumpster Service is an efficient way for you to dispose of your scrap metal. We have five hook trucks, two transport trucks, 2 rollback and over 260 roll-off dumpsters that are easily loaded and unloaded. We offer a variety of dumpster sizes to better suit your individual needs.We have licensed commercial truck scales at both locations, with easy access to weigh any size truck. We also own several small, digital, non ferrous scales.Basin Industries Inc. is open year round to serve your needs. We buy anything that is metal and we purchase them from you at a current and honest market value. Basin Industries is one of Utah's largest scrap metal recycling and brokers.Basin Industries has recently moved its location in Vernal to a 15 acre yard and facility. It has easy in and out access.(In 1993)... "The company motto states their purpose: "Recycling Metal for a Better Community to Build a Better Nation." This motto is based on Scott Bingham's main philosophy: ’the planet isn't getting any bigger... Once a piece of metal goes into a landfill, its life is over. If we can recycle it, it has a new life. What comes in during one day is processed and sent to the mills. It is realistic that within three days it's new metal again... instead of using tax dollars to pay for a landfill funeral." In 2012 Basin Industries expanded and now has a recycling center in Price, UT.ServicesWe recycle the following with competitive pricing: * Stainless Steel  * Steel * Iron * Copper * Aluminum * Insulated Wire * Tin * Brass * Soda Cans * Monel * Precious Metals * Radiators * Vehicles * Tungsten * BatteriesIn order to provide the best quality and most efficient service for our customers, Basin Industries Inc. strives to stay current on technological advances in the scrap metal recycling world. There are several ways that we accomplish this; for example, we maintain good communications with other scrap metal purchasers in order to find what scrap refining processes work best for them, the current prices paid for scrap, which machinery is the most efficient in breaking down specific metals, etc. At present, Basin Industries has 10 excavators with magnets, grapples, or shears; aluminum balers, non-ferrous shears, wire strippers, Niton metal identifiers, cutting torches, and several dedicated, and well trained employees.Company NameBasin Industries IncBusiness CategoryScrap Metal RecyclingAddress1120 E 1500 SVernalUtahUnited StatesZIP: 84078PresidentNAYear EstablishedNAEmployeesNAMembershipsNAHours of OperationMon - Fri 8:00am - 5:00pm; Sat 8:00am-12:00pmCompany ServicesScrap Metal RecyclingDemolition And Clean-up Services

What We Do

Basin Industries Inc. is more than just a 'scrap yard'. We now provide two locations; one in Price, Utah and the other in Vernal, Utah

Many People are unaware that Basin Industries Inc. offers demolition and clean-up services on location. We will do demolition work on oilfield tanks, pipelines, buildings, mines, farms, power plants, etc.

Our Dumpster Service is an efficient way for you to dispose of your scrap metal. We have five hook trucks, two transport trucks, 2 rollback and over 300 roll-off dumpsters that are easily loaded and unloaded. We offer a variety of dumpster sizes to better suit your individual needs.

We have licensed commercial truck scales at both locations, with easy access to weigh any size truck. We also own several small, digital, non ferrous scales.

Basin Industries Inc. is open year round to serve your needs. We buy anything that is metal and we purchase them from you at a current and honest market value. Basin Industries is one of Utah's largest scrap metal recycling and brokers.

Basin Industries has recently moved its location in Vernal, to a 15 acre yard and facility.  It has easy in and out access.
