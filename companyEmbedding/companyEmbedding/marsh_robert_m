					Does anybody know where the nickname of  "Marsh Robert" came from for Robert E. Lee.  Also, I just started reading "Killing Lincoln" by Bill O'Reilly and find it a good read but I'm wondering what others thought of it..

					I believe that would be Marse Robert, slang for Master.

					The connotation seems self-evident enough: men referred to him the way a faithful body servant would, who'd been raised with his master, to point out in a gently humorous way their devotion and loyalty to him, as well as the fact that they were subservient to him in the army. But I do wonder if anyone has traced it to a particular time or regiment or how it became popularized and spread, since it seems unique to Lee. There was no similar popularity of Marse Davis, Marse Jackson, etc., for example.

I thought it was a nice quick read. It was roundly criticized by some in academia, but to me the flaws were less troublesome as a whole.

I found the following flaws:

Referring to the Confederate battle flag as the Stars and Bars.
Stating that Lewis Powell had an Alabama accent, even after they mention that he was a Floridian.
Mixing up the roles in the Dan Sickles/Philip Barton Key incident.
Not mentioning A.P. Hill getting killed trying to rally his troops on April 1.
The most egregious; trying to implicate Stanton and LaFayette Baker in the assassination plot. They had no more to do with it than Lee and Davis. If they wanted to re-introduce that as a plotline, put it in an appendix and explain why they believe it to be true.

As an east Tennessean, I'll have to give Andrew Johnson credit for trying to put the country back together  somewhat the way Lincoln wanted. In " Killing Lincoln " the authors I believe have that backward. They seem to suggest it was the radical Republican Congress that kept Johnson from punishing the south more than they were. It was actually the other way around. The book's a good read though. Believe you'll enjoy it.

Interesting points you've made-well at least it didn't turn into an Oliver Stone movie! I haven't really even studied the assasination plot and the what happened afterwards but I find it fascinating just like just about everything else about the civil war.

Yes ,ell the people that were born and raised in a section of the country tend to know their history a lot better than others-I think I read that Tennessee was a key state during the Civil War in terms of it's location and the products it produced-is that right?

The book is fascinating. I understand that the Scott brothers are making the movie.

Oh yes I think I did hear about that.  O'Reilly is very articulate, so he writes pretty good books. (don't want to forget his co-author though, Martin Dugard.

Looking forward to his Kennedy book. I have some distant connections with that one, and would like to see how they portray them.

BTW, whereabouts in San Diego are you from?

					Have not read the book. I usually don't like O'Reilly stuff. Is he fair to General Lee and the ANV.

I have heard that he criticized Lee for continuing to go to church in Petersurg. Which is a mistake only a person that did not understand Lee could make.

I thought he was fair to Lee and the ANV. He gets some of his stuff though from Longstreet's book. As much as I like Longstreet, I think he should have used Alexander's book. I don't remember that criticism, but it has been a while since I read it.

While Tennessee was part of the Confederacy, there was very strong Union sentiment in my native east Tennessee. The railroads between Tennessee & Virginia, Georgia, and the lower south were vital to the war effort of both sides.

BTW, I meant to ask you, is the Down Home Picking Parlor still in Johnson City? I think it was owned by a guy named Tank Leach. Also, is the Parson's Table still in Jonesborough? Great food.

I'm taking an extended road trip to either Tennessee or New Orleans next week-I'm assuming Tennessee has more civil war history-any really good museums? I read about one at Fort Donelson that sounded pretty cool.

I used to live in La Jolla for a short while, then in PB. When in PB, I lived in the Oakwood Apartments on on 3000-something Ingraham Street. When in La Jolla, I worked at The Spot Restaurant on Prospect.

I think I stayed near you. When vacationing, I stayed in various hotels on Hotel Circle, off of I-8.

No Kidding-my brother had his wedding reception at the Oakwood Apts.  La Jolla has some of the best food in the city as you probably know-when did you leave?  Very expensive to live out here.  I'm getting real tired of it although San Diego is still very beautiful.
