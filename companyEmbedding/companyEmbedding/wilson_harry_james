101112Arthur Bea Wilson(Harry Potter raised by deadpool) vs. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres(Harry Potter raised by a brilliant scientist) (self.whowouldwin)submitted 3 years ago by [deleted]For those unfamiliar, Arthur is what you'd expect - insane, rather creative and fairly intelligent. Generally unserious and playful in about everything. Incredibly powerful in magically ability, but only knows a handful of actual spells because he doesn't care to study. Capable of transforming into an allosaurus, although not at will. Talented with weapons, espionage, explosives and martial arts.
Harry James is a first class scientific and magical prodigy. Creative - although perhaps less so than Arthur, knows a large arsenal of spells and abilities, and quite capable of killing, especially if pushed. Excellent fighting instinct and reactions, and is quite capable of using his genius to devastating result in the middle of fights. 
Round 1: Arthur one hours prep, James with none.
Round 2: James with one hours Prep.
Round 3: Both one one hour of prep time. 
Round 4: No prep time on either side.
Round 5: One months prep time, allowed to gain others aid by any means. Essentially, who could build the best army in that time?

What is this?


permalinkembedsave[–]whatswiththesefrogs 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago* (9 children)Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres in 1-4 I just don't see what advantage Arthur has over him except slightly better magical potential (which doesn't help).
Round 5 depends on what universe this is taking place in, and what universe each version of Harry occupies.
EDIT: Grammar

permalinkembedsaveparent[–]whatswiththesefrogs 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (7 children)Insanity is more of a disadvantage than anything. I suppose being physically superior would help him but only so much, especially since this is a magical duel/prep battle. 
I was not aware he had killed people before, that wasn't in the description. That being said, the description does state that Harry James is "quite capable of killing" so again, not a huge advantage.

permalinkembedsaveparent[–]whatswiththesefrogs 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (5 children)I don't think things like reflexes are dependent on who raises you, it's more a combination of genetics and training. Granted, Deadpool might have given him more/better training I'm just going at this based on the assumption both have thorough physical training.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago* (4 children)[deleted]


What is this?


permalinkembedsaveparent[–]Thasvaddef 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (0 children)Wizards in HJPEV's world seem to have pretty quick reflexes since that is often what determines the winner in a duel (especially an ambush), but I don't think he's been in the wizarding world long enough to have trained his reflexes much yet. he's still quicker than average from the battles though.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]whatswiththesefrogs 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (2 children)I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. I know people who have fathers that are very physically fit but they themselves are not. Physical fitness, reaction speed etc. doesn't magically transfer from father to son. There is a genetic component to it but we are talking about a son who was adopted so that doesn't factor in.
Who raised him is irrelevant- if Deadpool let him sit on a couch and gorge on chimichangas all day (as DP does himself at times) he won't be in good shape. Conversely he could be raised by the fattest most out of shape nerd in the world but if he trains all day every day he would still be in amazing shape.
I never said being raised by a scientist gives you an automatic victory that wouldn't make sense. I'm not sure where you're getting that from.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–][deleted] 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago* (1 child)[deleted]


What is this?


permalinkembedsaveparent[–]whatswiththesefrogs 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (0 children)I get that, I'm just saying that being raised by someone with fast reflexes doesn't automatically give you their reflexes, especially considering Deadpool's reflexes come more from the Weapon X experiments than training. Granted he COULD have faster reflexes as DP's son but only if he was trained better.  Given that he's gotten martial arts training I would assume that he does have good reflexes but you also wrote Harry James has "Excellent fighting instinct and reactions" so I assumed that his reflexes were at least as good if not better. Which would make sense if his father trained him that way. 
You don't have to be Deadpool to give someone good training, look at the way Professor X has trained the X-Men in combat and he's crippled. Furthermore it takes a lot of patience and discipline to be a good instructor, two things Deadpool lacks.

permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold[–]Thasvaddef 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (0 children)I don't know anything about Arthur but I'll point out that if HJPEV knew he would definitely lose, he could force a draw by transfiguring something into a nice big piece of antimatter.

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]Thasvaddef 0 points1 point2 points 3 years ago (0 children)Does HJPEV have the invisiblity cloak and time-turner? And his broomstick or rock?
