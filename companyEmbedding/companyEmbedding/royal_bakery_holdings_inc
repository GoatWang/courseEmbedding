(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  Royal Bakery Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 7, 2011. Royal Bakery is currently located in Belmont, California, and is a holding company with its core business as a bakery and bistro and is also a franchisor.  Royal Bakery Holdings, Inc. has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Royal Bakery Sourcing and Trading Corp. ("RBSTC"), which was incorporated on August 20, 2013 under the laws of the State of California. RBSTC is an operating arm to purchase the bakery and bistro products from suppliers and resell the bakery and bistro products to the food retailers and franchisees. Currently, the principal supplier is Majestic Production of Peninsula, LLC ("Majestic Production"), the operator of Royal Bakery's acting central kitchen and which is 100% owned by Egg Tart Cafe United Holdings, LLC ("Egg Tart Cafe") with whom Royal Bakery has a sub-franchisor agreement, and which beneficially owns about 18% of our common stock.  RECENT ACTIVITIES  Our franchisee, Ovo Cafe, Inc. sold its food truck on December 31, 2014 and its restaurant at 171 Second Street, San Francisco on February 1, 2015.  The Hongrykong food truck and the Ovo Cafe restaurant order their food and drink products through our subsidiary Royal Bakery Sourcing and Trading, Inc. Therefore, we still placed orders to Majestic Production of Peninsula to support the food truck and Ovo Cafe through November 2, 2015 at which time we ceased sales activity. However, we are still working with Egg Tart Cafe United Holdings to identify other opportunities for food distribution.  We are considering initiating another food distribution operation to utilize our existing central kitchen. We presently plan that the prospective distribution could go through mobile units and or through online ordering services.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.  Principles of Consolidation  The books and records of the parent company Royal Bakery Holdings, Inc. have been consolidated with the records of the wholly-owned subsidiary, Royal Bakery Sourcing and Trading Corp. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. All of the inter-company transactions have been eliminated, upon consolidation.  Franchise and License Operations  The Company executes franchise or license agreements for each unit operated by other parties which set out the terms of our arrangement with the franchisee or licensee. The franchise and license agreements typically require the franchisee or licensee to pay an initial, non-refundable fee and continuing fees based upon a percentage of sales. Subject to the Company's approval and franchisee's payment of renewal fee, a franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration.  Revenue Recognition  Income from the franchisees includes initial fees, continuing fees and renewal fees. The Company recognizes initial fees received from a franchisee as revenue when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement, which is generally upon the opening of a restaurant. The Company recognizes continuing fees based upon a percentage of franchisee sales. The Company recognizes renewal fees when a renewal agreement with a franchisee becomes effective. Revenue from product sales are recognized when the food, beverage products, and packaging supplies are sold.  Inventory  Inventories consist of finished goods (packaging supplies) and are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management's analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts. At December 31, 2015, the company wrote off $15,541 of obsolete and slow moving inventory. There was no provision recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014. Shipping costs are included in the cost of products purchased.  Amortization  Intangible assets are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.  Impairment of Long-Lived Asset  We review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the future use and disposal of the related assets or group of assets to their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value based on market value (when available) or discounted cash flows of those assets, and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. These tests were performed for the year ended December 31, 2014 and it was determined that the carrying value of the asset was impaired. Accordingly, an impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 amounting to $15,187 was recognized.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated revenues of $157,464. The revenues are derived from wholesale revenues of $157,062 and royalty revenues of $402. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we generated revenues of $255,855, and such revenues were derived from wholesale revenues of $197,843, franchise revenues of $50,000, and royalty revenues of $8,012.  For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our costs of wholesale revenues amounted to $164,606 and $189,998, respectively resulting in a gross loss of $7,142 and a gross profit of $ $65,857 for the years then ended.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred expenses of $127,792, consisting of legal and professional of $75,562, rent of $6,000, and general and administrative expenses of $46,230. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred expenses of $241,121, consisting of legal and professional of $148,941, rent of $22,500, general and administrative expenses of $54,593 and impairment of intangible asset of $15,187.  We incurred net losses of $134,762 and $174,797 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.   December 31 Balance Sheet Data 2015 2014 Cash $ 15,773 $ 5,780 Total Assets $ 18,089 $ 142,002 Total Liabilities $ 45,351 $ 39,192 Shareholders' Equity (deficiency) $ (27,262 ) $ 102,810  GOING CONCERN  Royal Bakery Holdings Inc. is a development stage company and currently has limited operations. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for Royal Bakery which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our cash balance at December 31, 2015 was $15,773, our total current assets were $18,089 and our total current liabilities were $45,351 resulting in a working capital deficit of $27,262. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are expected to be approximately $230,000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to generating revenues from operations we may utilize funds from our director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating costs, however they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us. Management believes our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months.  PLAN OF OPERATION  Our plan of operations over the 12-month period consists of creating a new brand and reselling bakery and food products to wholesalers and retailers. We are planning to get into the online catering businesses since we have contracted the central kitchen in Belmont, California.  In connection with our business of reselling bakery and food products, we will monitor the quality of the products we purchase, a substantial portion of which are produced by Majestic Production, which is owned by Egg Tart Cafe. If necessary, we will assist Majestic Production in refining the menu and providing technical assistance to improve its productivity. Although we are not required to do so, we believe that it is in our best interest to coordinate closely with Majestic Production and share our expertise if it can improve the quality of the food offered to our customers.  On a timing level, we anticipate that we will take the following actions over the following periods:  ? In the 180days from December 31, 2015, we will work with Egg Tart Cafe to find a brand to develop our franchise operation. We expect to develop a smaller operation then a full services restaurant, such as a deli and cafe type of food business. We have developed the website and will be ready for online catering operation.  ? In the 270 days, we hope we can establish another brand for our catering operation, and review the performance of this online catering business.  ? In the 360 days, management hopes to evaluate the result of our planning operation and assist Egg Tart Cafe to fine tune this business model, particular the online catering operation.  We plan to develop an online food delivery service and a line of grocery items. We plan to bottle our sauces, such as curry sauce, cream sauce, tomato sauce and black pepper sauce as grocery items. We believe that these products will help maintain operations. We plan to work with a mobile grocery truck operator to sell the sauces and our existing frozen food items. We currently provide food and grocery products to this mobile grocery operator and use online ordering to pre-arranged pick up locations for the customers.  We believe the above mentioned programs have the potential to help Royal Bakery to generate income to maintain operations.  Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further financing, the successful development of our planned Food services, a successful marketing and promotion program, and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.  OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS  We have had no off balance sheet transactions.

highly competitive. Our restaurants will compete with a large number of other
fast food restaurants in the areas in which they operate. Many of these
restaurants are owned and operated by regional and national restaurant chains,

name recognition and marketing capability. Furthermore, most of our competitors
in the fast-food business operate more restaurants, have been established
longer, and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do.
There is also active competition for management personnel, as well as for
attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants.


Company Description
Royal Bakery Holdings, Inc. is a bakery and café franchisor and wholesaler of 
bakery and bistro products.

Our franchisor business focuses on franchising bakeries and cafes serving Hong
Kong style cuisine under the OVO brand. Since Royal Bakery was incorporated in
2011, we have spent $32,325 on


 applying for and obtaining a franchise
registration in California. On October 3, 2012, we signed a sub-franchisor
agreement with Egg Tart Café United Holdings, LLC (“Egg Tart Café”), a Delaware
limited liability company that beneficially owns about 18% of our common stock.
The Sub-Franchisor Agreement, which has a term of ten years, grants Egg Tart
Café an exclusive license to franchise bakeries and cafes under the OVO brand in
North America and South America in exchange for payments totaling $50,000, a
monthly royalty equal to thirty percent of all royalty proceeds Sub-franchisor
receives from its unit franchises and one-time sub-franchise sign up fees
ranging from $5,000 to $14,500, depending on the type of OVO brand business
sub-franchised. We do not receive any sub-franchisee sign up fees until the
aggregate of such fees exceeds the $50,000 sub-franchisor fee received from Egg
Tart Café. In January 2014, the first OVO branded food truck was opened as an
Egg Tart Café’s sub-franchisee. In February 2014, the first OVO branded
restaurant was opened as the Egg Tart Café’s sub-franchisee. As a result of
these two openings, the $20,000 franchise fee that had been received from Egg
Tart Café in connection with the sub-franchise agreement and that we had
previously deemed to be “unearned income” is now deemed to be earned income as
well as the $30,000 which is to be received over the next two years, for a total
of $50,000 to be recorded as income in January 2014.
                                        
We have spent $55,333 to bring experienced Hong Kong Style cuisine chefs from
Hong Kong to advise and share their recipes with Egg Tart Café, our
sub-franchisor and the parent company of our food supplier, so that Egg Tart
Cafe can develop and provide Hong Kong style cuisine food to our brand
specifications.
                                        
We also generate revenues through the resale of the bakery and bistro products
through RBSTC. We buy these products from Majestic Productions of Peninsula LLC,
(“Majestic Production”), a food producer located in Belmont, California.
Majestic Production is wholly-owned by Egg Tart Café. Majestic Production
produces the food products under the direct supervision of Egg Tart Café. On
September 1, 2013, we entered into a non-binding agreement with Majestic
Production under which we agree to buy and Majestic Production agrees to sell us
products at a 5% discount off the regular sales price at which Majestic
Production would sell to other third parties. In the year ended December 31,
2013, we generated $21,811 of revenue through the resale of the bakery and
bistro products, the cost of which was $23,229, of which $20,786 was purchased
from Majestic Production. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we
generated $111,276 of revenue through the resale of the bakery and bistro
products. We purchased these products from our affiliate Majestic Production at
a cost $88,396 and from other unaffiliated vendors at a cost of $15,213.
---

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 7, 2011. We incorporated
a wholly owned California subsidiary corporation, Royal Bakery Sourcing and 
Trading Corp. (“RBSTC”), on August 20, 2013, as the operating company. Both 
Royal Bakery and RBSTC are currently located and operated at 405 Old County 
Road, Belmont, California 94002. Our telephone number: (650) 530-0368.
