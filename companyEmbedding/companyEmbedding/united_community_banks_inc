Team will be Part of Newly Renamed Commercial Banking Solutions

BLAIRSVILLE, Ga., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Community Banks, Inc. (NASDAQ:UCBI) today announced the addition of Clayton Summers who joins United's lending team to focus on the renewable energy sector. Summers has more than 18 years of banking industry experience and deep expertise in renewable energy finance.
"We are pleased to welcome Clayton and his expertise to our team" said Rich Bradshaw, President of United's newly renamed Commercial Banking Solutions area. "Renewable energy offers an exciting opportunity for us and we look forward to being able to fulfill the financing needs of this important growing energy segment."
Summers joins United after a lengthy and successful career in commercial and investment banking. Most recently, he served as a relationship manager with financial institutions in Charlotte, N.C. and developed a focus on assisting the renewable energy industry, including solar developers and energy tech companies. Summers has a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in business administration from Wake Forest University.
"The Renewable Energy lending team will be part of Commercial Banking Solutions, formerly known as Specialized Lending," said Lynn Harton, President and Chief Operating Officer of United. "When this group was created in 2014, we knew that adding specialized commercial lending expertise to our best-in-class community banking would be a success. With Rich Bradshaw's leadership, the group has continually met expectations and is now a significant contributor to United's profitability and growth. Given that the group contains a diversified set of commercial services bringing ‘large bank' lending expertise to our clients, we believe that ‘Commercial Banking Solutions' gives better clarity to its purpose."
In addition to Renewable Energy, Commercial Banking Solutions will continue to include the traditional commercial lending areas of Middle Market, Asset Based, Income Property, Senior Care, SBA and Builder Finance. As Commercial Banking Solutions president, Bradshaw will continue to lead and oversee the development of these business lines while continuing to assess potential new services as well.

Expands franchise footprint into the attractive Raleigh, NC MSA
Partnership with 105-year-old community bank with significant operations in North Carolina's fastest-growing MSA; consistent with United growth strategy
Strategically and financially attractive combination

BLAIRSVILLE, Ga. and FOUR OAKS, N.C., June  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Community Banks, Inc. (NASDAQ:UCBI) ("United") and Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. (OTCQX:FOFN) ("Four Oaks") announced today a definitive agreement for United to acquire Four Oaks and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company ("Four Oaks Bank"), in a stock and cash transaction. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each company and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Four Oaks Bank operates 14 banking offices, 12 of which are located in the Raleigh, North Carolina metropolitan statistical area, including loan production offices in Raleigh and Apex. Two additional banking offices are located in the eastern North Carolina locations of Dunn and Wallace. The merger will expand United's presence in these fast-growing markets and allow it to offer its expanded product line to Four Oaks Bank's customers.
Under the terms of the agreement, Four Oaks shareholders will receive merger consideration consisting of approximately 90 percent stock, with a fixed exchange ratio of .6178 shares of United common stock and 10 percent cash or $1.90 for each share of Four Oaks. The transaction is currently valued at approximately $124 million based on United's closing price of $26.48 per share on June 23, 2017. The transaction is expected to be less than 1 percent dilutive to United's tangible book value per share, including one-time transaction costs; and 2 percent - or $.04 per share - accretive to United's fully diluted earnings per share for 2018, excluding one-time transaction costs. 
"This transaction is yet another example of our growth strategy into new, fast-growing markets," said Jimmy Tallent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of United. "Four Oaks provides a strong customer base and an excellent springboard for additional growth in metropolitan Raleigh. It will also greatly assist us in attracting strong, in-market bankers to grow in this new market area for United. With a number of merger transactions taking place across North Carolina, and in the Raleigh MSA in particular, we are confident in the opportunities such market disruption will offer. Our intent is to further expand our presence in Raleigh-area communities while creating value for shareholders and customers of both organizations."
Tallent continued, "We are especially pleased to join forces with a 105-year-old, highly respected community bank with a tremendous core deposit and customer base. Four Oaks' commitment to outstanding customer and community service is well aligned with our own, making this a great cultural fit. The combined franchise will be well positioned for growth and success and we will be focused on investing in additional lending resources to take advantage of this great opportunity."
"We are very excited to join the United Community Bank team," said Chief Executive Officer David Rupp. "Four Oaks shareholders will be rewarded through the superior financial performance of United and Four Oaks customers will find that they share our focus on outstanding personalized service. Together, we will leverage the new resources and products available through United Community Bank to expand relationships and continue to grow in North Carolina."
Four Oaks Bank will merge into United's bank subsidiary and will operate under the United Community Bank brand. At March 31, 2017, Four Oaks Bank had $737 million in assets, including $513 million in loans, and $560 million in deposits, of which nearly two-thirds are considered core deposits.
"The transaction with Four Oaks is a success for customers, employees and shareholders of both organizations and ultimately our combined company," said United President and Chief Operating Officer Lynn Harton. "I am originally from North Carolina and spent a good part of my early career in eastern NC and Raleigh. We are excited to have this opportunity to build upon the Four Oaks team and their legacy of community focus and excellent customer service."
Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the approval of Four Oaks' shareholders.
Banks Street Partners, LLC acted as financial advisor to United, and Troutman Sanders LLP served as its legal advisor. Sandler O'Neill + Partners, LP served as Four Oaks' financial advisor, and Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jernigan, LLP served as its legal advisor.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

United Community Banks, Inc. and Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. Announce Merger Agreement
BY GlobeNewswire— 6:00 AM ET 06/27/2017


Expands franchise footprint into the attractive Raleigh, NC MSAPartnership with 105-year-old community bank with significant operations in North Carolina’s fastest-growing MSA; consistent with United growth strategyStrategically and financially attractive combination BLAIRSVILLE, Ga. and FOUR OAKS, N.C., June  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Community Banks, Inc. (UCBI) (“United”) and Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. (FOFN) (“Four Oaks”) announced today a definitive agreement for United to acquire Four Oaks and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company (“Four Oaks Bank”), in a stock and cash transaction. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each company and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Four Oaks Bank operates 14 banking offices, 12 of which are located in the Raleigh, North Carolina metropolitan statistical area, including loan production offices in Raleigh and Apex. Two additional banking offices are located in the eastern North Carolina locations of Dunn and Wallace. The merger will expand United’s presence in these fast-growing markets and allow it to offer its expanded product line to Four Oaks Bank’s customers. Under the terms of the agreement, Four Oaks shareholders will receive merger consideration consisting of approximately 90 percent stock, with a fixed exchange ratio of .6178 shares of United common stock and 10 percent cash or $1.90 for each share of Four Oaks. The transaction is currently valued at approximately $124 million based on United’s closing price of $26.48 per share on June 23, 2017. The transaction is expected to be less than 1 percent dilutive to United’s tangible book value per share, including one-time transaction costs; and 2 percent – or $.04 per share – accretive to United’s fully diluted earnings per share for 2018, excluding one-time transaction costs.  “This transaction is yet another example of our growth strategy into new, fast-growing markets,” said Jimmy Tallent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of United. “Four Oaks provides a strong customer base and an excellent springboard for additional growth in metropolitan Raleigh. It will also greatly assist us in attracting strong, in-market bankers to grow in this new market area for United. With a number of merger transactions taking place across North Carolina, and in the Raleigh MSA in particular, we are confident in the opportunities such market disruption will offer. Our intent is to further expand our presence in Raleigh-area communities while creating value for shareholders and customers of both organizations.” Tallent continued, “We are especially pleased to join forces with a 105-year-old, highly respected community bank with a tremendous core deposit and customer base. Four Oaks’ commitment to outstanding customer and community service is well aligned with our own, making this a great cultural fit. The combined franchise will be well positioned for growth and success and we will be focused on investing in additional lending resources to take advantage of this great opportunity.” “We are very excited to join the United Community Bank team,” said Chief Executive Officer David Rupp. “Four Oaks shareholders will be rewarded through the superior financial performance of United and Four Oaks customers will find that they share our focus on outstanding personalized service. Together, we will leverage the new resources and products available through United Community Bank to expand relationships and continue to grow in North Carolina.” Four Oaks Bank will merge into United’s bank subsidiary and will operate under the United Community Bank brand. At March 31, 2017, Four Oaks Bank had $737 million in assets, including $513 million in loans, and $560 million in deposits, of which nearly two-thirds are considered core deposits. “The transaction with Four Oaks is a success for customers, employees and shareholders of both organizations and ultimately our combined company,” said United President and Chief Operating Officer Lynn Harton. “I am originally from North Carolina and spent a good part of my early career in eastern NC and Raleigh. We are excited to have this opportunity to build upon the Four Oaks team and their legacy of community focus and excellent customer service.” Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the approval of Four Oaks’ shareholders. Banks Street Partners, LLC acted as financial advisor to United, and Troutman Sanders LLP served as its legal advisor. Sandler O’Neill + Partners, LP served as Four Oaks’ financial advisor, and Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jernigan, LLP served as its legal advisor.  About United Community Banks, Inc.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

A Secure Access Code (SAC) is a security feature that allows you to register the computer you are using for "one-time" or "future" use. Registering your computer is another layer of security to help prevent your online banking account from being accessed by an unregistered computer-even if your Login ID and Password are accidentally or unintentionally compromised.
 
Why do I need a Secure Access Code?
Registering your computer is another layer of security to ensure your Online Banking account cannot be accessed by an unregistered computer – even if your Login ID and Password are accidentally or unintentionally compromised.



When you log in from an unrecognized computer or mobile device, we will send you a single-use Secure Access Code. The code will be delivered to you using secure contact information that we have on file for your accounts. You can choose to have your Secure Access Code delivered via text message, phone call or e-mail, depending on what contact information we have on file for you. Once you receive the temporary Secure Access Code from United Community Bank, enter it in the space provided within login.
 
When you use a private device that you will frequently use to access Online Banking, you can “register the device”, which will allow us to recognize the device and browser you’re using.  Once you have registered your device, you will not be prompted for a Secure Access Code with future logins.  However, if the computer you use is public or one which you do not regularly use, we recommend for your security that you “do not register” the device.
 
I didn’t receive my Secure Access Code or my contact information is outdated.
Please call us at 1-800-822-2651 during business hours so we may assist you.
 
I have registered my device, but Online Banking prompts for another Secure Access Code.  Why?
There are several reasons this may happen.  Most commonly this occurs when your browser settings are setup to delete cookies, or your browser cookie for Online Banking has been deleted since your last login.  This can also happen if you are logging in with a different browser on the same registered device. You may have a program on your device that automatically deletes the cookie and that feature would need to be turned off or configured to accept and retain cookies from United Community Bank.
 
How do I remove the registration from a device?
You can remove the registration of a device or browser by deleting your cookies, or only the cookie related to Online Banking.
 Your security is our top priority. But we need your help. 
To ensure that your financial information is secure whenever you use the Internet, we’re asking you to take a few minutes right now to make sure you’re using the most current version of your Web browser. That’s because the browser—the software application that lets you surf the Web—also plays a huge role in protecting you and the data you choose to share when you’re online. The most common browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer®, Mozilla Firefox®, Google Chrome™ and Safari®.
As online fraud and theft evolves, browsers must become more secure with each new version. That’s why companies that provide Web browsers continually release patches to stay one step ahead of fraudsters. So it’s vital that individual users, like you, routinely apply the upgrades to stay protected-on your smartphone, tablet and computer.
Always using a current Web browser is vital to keeping the information you share and the sites you visit secure. This includes the financial information you view and exchange while using Online Banking. Knowing you’re using the most current version is one of the best ways to give yourself peace of mind.
There are many versions in use today that provide adequate protection. If you’re using any of these you’re in great shape:
Microsoft Internet Explorer® 10.0 or higher
Mozilla Firefox® 24 or higher
Google Chrome™ 27.0 or higher
Safari® 6 or higher
If you’re unsure which version you’re using, please take a moment to check with the browser provider to make sure it’s current. To do this, simply visit the website of your preferred provider and navigate to their updates/patches. Or, you may also click on the link above that’s associated with your browser to download the latest version. If you have questions or need assistance updating your browser, please contact us during business hours at 1-800-822-2651 or onlinebanking@ucbi.com.

Announce Merger AgreementGlobeNewswire•June 27, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareExpands franchise footprint into the attractive Raleigh, NC MSAPartnership with 105-year-old community bank with significant operations in North Carolina’s fastest-growing MSA; consistent with United growth strategyStrategically and financially attractive combinationBLAIRSVILLE, Ga. and FOUR OAKS, N.C., June 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- United Community Banks, Inc. (UCBI) (“United”) and Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. (FOFN) (“Four Oaks”) announced today a definitive agreement for United to acquire Four Oaks and its wholly owned bank subsidiary, Four Oaks Bank & Trust Company (“Four Oaks Bank”), in a stock and cash transaction. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each company and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.Four Oaks Bank operates 14 banking offices, 12 of which are located in the Raleigh, North Carolina metropolitan statistical area, including loan production offices in Raleigh and Apex. Two additional banking offices are located in the eastern North Carolina locations of Dunn and Wallace. The merger will expand United’s presence in these fast-growing markets and allow it to offer its expanded product line to Four Oaks Bank’s customers.Under the terms of the agreement, Four Oaks shareholders will receive merger consideration consisting of approximately 90 percent stock, with a fixed exchange ratio of .6178 shares of United common stock and 10 percent cash or $1.90 for each share of Four Oaks. The transaction is currently valued at approximately $124 million based on United’s closing price of $26.48 per share on June 23, 2017. The transaction is expected to be less than 1 percent dilutive to United’s tangible book value per share, including one-time transaction costs; and 2 percent – or $.04 per share – accretive to United’s fully diluted earnings per share for 2018, excluding one-time transaction costs. “This transaction is yet another example of our growth strategy into new, fast-growing markets,” said Jimmy Tallent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of United. “Four Oaks provides a strong customer base and an excellent springboard for additional growth in metropolitan Raleigh. It will also greatly assist us in attracting strong, in-market bankers to grow in this new market area for United. With a number of merger transactions taking place across North Carolina, and in the Raleigh MSA in particular, we are confident in the opportunities such market disruption will offer. Our intent is to further expand our presence in Raleigh-area communities while creating value for shareholders and customers of both organizations.”Tallent continued, “We are especially pleased to join forces with a 105-year-old, highly respected community bank with a tremendous core deposit and customer base. Four Oaks’ commitment to outstanding customer and community service is well aligned with our own, making this a great cultural fit. The combined franchise will be well positioned for growth and success and we will be focused on investing in additional lending resources to take advantage of this great opportunity.”“We are very excited to join the United Community Bank team,” said Chief Executive Officer David Rupp. “Four Oaks shareholders will be rewarded through the superior financial performance of United and Four Oaks customers will find that they share our focus on outstanding personalized service. Together, we will leverage the new resources and products available through United Community Bank to expand relationships and continue to grow in North Carolina.”Four Oaks Bank will merge into United’s bank subsidiary and will operate under the United Community Bank brand. At March 31, 2017, Four Oaks Bank had $737 million in assets, including $513 million in loans, and $560 million in deposits, of which nearly two-thirds are considered core deposits.“The transaction with Four Oaks is a success for customers, employees and shareholders of both organizations and ultimately our combined company,” said United President and Chief Operating Officer Lynn Harton. “I am originally from North Carolina and spent a good part of my early career in eastern NC and Raleigh. We are excited to have this opportunity to build upon the Four Oaks team and their legacy of community focus and excellent customer service.”Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the approval of Four Oaks’ shareholders.Banks Street Partners, LLC acted as financial advisor to United, and Troutman Sanders LLP served as its legal advisor. Sandler O’Neill + Partners, LP served as Four Oaks’ financial advisor, and Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jernigan, LLP served as its legal advisor. Read MoreAbout United Community Banks, Inc.United Community Banks, Inc.

Most recently, he served as a relationship manager with financial institutions in Charlotte, N.C. and developed a focus on assisting the renewable energy industry, including solar developers and energy tech companies.

Getting Ready For United'sNew Online Banking Upgrades
In just a few weeks, your Online Banking experience will be upgraded. To ensure a smooth transition to the new system, there are a few small steps you should take to get ready:







Confirm your browser is current. An updated browser is the gateway to a better and more secure online financial experience. It's vital that you use the most current version of your preferred browser, adjust your settings (if using Internet Explorer®) and consider “registering your device” when logging in for the first time. Get started.







Verify your email address. A current email address is crucial to our ability to communicate with you about the planned upgrade and send you the new Secure Access Code you will need to sign in to United’s new Online Banking system. To update your email, you will log in to Online Banking as you normally do and select "Options" from the menu bar. The current email address on file will display in the "E-Mail" box. Select "Edit" to make changes.







Update financial software. If you utilize financial software such as Quicken® or QuickBooks™, there will be some additional steps to take to ensure you are able to continue to successfully download transactions from the new Online Banking system. Find out more.

Reminder: United's New OnlineBanking Experience Is Almost Here
In just a few days, your Online Banking experience will be upgraded. Upon logging in to the new Online Banking system, you will choose where you would like us to deliver your Secure Access Code. 







A Secure Access Code (SAC) is a temporary, one-time code that will help us identify you and your device. It will allow you to log in to Online Banking and “register your device.” The SAC is only valid for a limited period of time.

What is a Secure Access Code?
A Secure Access Code (SAC) is a security feature that allows you to register the computer you are using for "one-time" or "future" use. 
 
Why do I need a Secure Access Code?
Registering your computer is another layer of security to ensure your Business Online Banking account cannot be accessed by an unregistered computer – even if your Login ID and Password are accidentally or unintentionally compromised.


Why do I need a Secure Access Code?
When you log in from an unrecognized computer or mobile device, we will send you a single-use Secure Access Code. The code will be delivered to you using secure contact information that we have on file for your accounts. You can choose to have your Secure Access Code delivered via text message, phone call or e-mail, depending on what contact information we have on file for you. Once you receive the temporary Secure Access Code from United Community Bank, enter it in the space provided within login.
 
When you use a private device that you will frequently use to access Business Online Banking, you can “register the device”, which will allow us to recognize the device and browser you’re using.  Once you have registered your device, you will not be prompted for a Secure Access Code with future logins.  However, if the computer you use is public or one which you do not regularly use, we recommend for your security that you “do not register” the device.
 
I didn’t receive my Secure Access Code or my contact information is outdated.
Please call us at 1-800-822-2651 during business hours so we may assist you.
 
I have registered my device, but Business Online Banking prompts for another Secure Access Code.  Why?
There are several reasons this may happen.  Most commonly this occurs when your browser settings are setup to delete cookies, or your browser cookie for Business Online Banking has been deleted since your last login.  This can also happen if you are logging in with a different browser on the same registered device. You may have a program on your device that automatically deletes the cookie and that feature would need to be turned off or configured to accept and retain cookies from United Community Bank.
 
How do I remove the registration from a device?
You can remove the registration of a device or browser by deleting your cookies, or only the cookie related to Business Online Banking.
 Your security is our top priority. But we need your help. 
To ensure that your financial information is secure whenever you use the Internet, we’re asking you to take a few minutes right now to make sure you’re using the most current version of your Web browser. That’s because the browser—the software application that lets you surf the Web—also plays a huge role in protecting you and the data you choose to share when you’re online. The most common browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer®, Mozilla Firefox®, Google Chrome™ and Safari®.
As online fraud and theft evolves, browsers must become more secure with each new version. That’s why companies that provide Web browsers continually release patches to stay one step ahead of fraudsters. So it’s vital that individual users, like you, routinely apply the upgrades to stay protected-on your smartphone, tablet and computer.
Always using a current Web browser is vital to keeping the information you share and the sites you visit secure. This includes the financial information you view and exchange while using Business Online Banking. Knowing you’re using the most current version is one of the best ways to give yourself peace of mind.
There are many versions in use today that provide adequate protection. If you’re using any of these you’re in great shape:
Microsoft Internet Explorer® 10.0 or higher
Mozilla Firefox® 24 or higher
Google Chrome™ 27.0 or higher
Safari® 6 or higher
If you’re unsure which version you’re using, please take a moment to check with the browser provider to make sure it’s current. To do this, simply visit the website of your preferred provider and navigate to their updates/patches. Or, you may also click on the link above that’s associated with your browser to download the latest version. If you have questions or need assistance updating your browser, please contact us during business hours at 1-800-822-2651 or onlinebanking@ucbi.com.

Getting Ready For United's New Business Online Banking Upgrades
In just a few weeks, your Business Online Banking experience will be upgraded. To ensure a smooth transition to the new system, there are a few small steps you should take to get ready:







Confirm your browser is current. An updated browser is the gateway to a better and more secure online financial experience. It's vital that you use the most current version of your preferred browser, adjust your settings (if using Internet Explorer®) and consider “registering your device” when logging in for the first time.  Get started.







Update financial software. If you utilize financial software such as Quicken® or QuickBooks™, there will be some additional steps to take to ensure you are able to continue to successfully download transactions from the new Business Online Banking system. Find out more.

Reminder: Your New Business Online Banking Experience Is Almost Here




In just a few days, your Business Online Banking experience will be upgraded. Upon logging in to the new Business Online Banking system, you will choose where you would like us to deliver your Secure Access Code. 
A Secure Access Code (SAC) is a temporary, one-time code that will help us identify you and your device. It will allow you to log in to Business Online Banking and “register your device.” The SAC is only valid for a limited period of time.
Registering your computer is another layer of security to help prevent your Business Online Banking account from being accessed by an unregistered computer – even if your Login ID and Password are accidentally or unintentionally compromised.
