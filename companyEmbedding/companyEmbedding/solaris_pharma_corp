BRIDGEWATER, NJ - The partnership of Advance Realty and CrossHarbor Capital Partners, LLC, announced, according to a release, that Solaris Pharma Corporation has expanded at the New Jersey Center of Excellence in Bridgewater.
Solaris signed an 18,072-square-foot-lease and is increasing its footprint by more than 13,000 square feet. The company, the release said, is engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products, with focuses on topical and transdermal products.
The company, the release said, is among many that have signed for significant expansions, including Avantor Performance Materials, Vertice Pharma, Matinas BioPharma and Clinical Genomics.Sign Up for E-News
Solaris, the release said, will be in the entire third floor of Building G.
“With modern R&D infrastructure that is second to none, and a location at the center of the Boston-to-D.C. corridor, the New Jersey Center of Excellence has proven to be the perfect fit for our company since we initially moved into the campus in 2015,” Lakshmi Raghavan, founder and president of Solaris, said in the release. “Our products have a relatively high barrier to entry due to manufacturing complexities and high-end clinical patient study demands, and our expanded space at NJCOE will enable us to create efficiencies that will help us thrive.”
