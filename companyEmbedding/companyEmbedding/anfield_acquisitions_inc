Exhibit 99.a

 


SUBSCRIPTION ESCROW
AGREEMENT

 


 

THIS ESCROW
AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of April
5,   2016, by and among Anfield Acquisitions,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company'' or "Client"), and
BRANCH BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY, a North Carolina banking
corporation (the "Escrow Agent"). This Agreement shall be effective
as provided in Paragraph 1 below.

 

WHEREAS, the
Company proposes to offer and sell, on a best-efforts basis through
its sole officer and director, Jacob Southworth (the "Placement
Agent") between 1,000,000 and 4,000,000 shares of common stock in
the Company at a purchase price of $0.10 per share (the "Shares")
to investors pursuant to the Company's Rule 419 S-l; and

 

WHEREAS, the
Company desires to establish an escrow in which funds received from
investors, and certificates will be deposited (the "Consideration")
until termination of escrow as defined below. The Escrow Agent is
willing to serve as Escrow Agent upon the terms and conditions
herein set forth; and

 

WHEREAS, in
order to subscribe for Shares, a Subscriber must deliver the full
amount of its subscription: (i) by check in U.S. dollars, (ii) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars, or
(iii) as otherwise agreed to by the Company (collectively, the
"Payment") (collectively, the "Offering Proceeds" or "Deposited
Proceeds").

 

NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged by the parties, the parties covenant and agree as
follows:

 

1.  Establishment of Escrow
Account

 

The parties
have established an escrow account with the Escrow Agent. Company
shall sell its shares only at the price of $0.10 per share during
this offering.

 


 

2.   Appointment of Escrow Agent;
Deposits of Cash and Securities

 

(a) The Client
hereby appoints the Escrow Agent as its agent and custodian to hold
and disburse the Payments deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant
to the terms of this Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) Following
the execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Client will cause to be
delivered to the Escrow Agent from time to time any and all
Payments in its possession or received from the Subscribers upon
the execution and delivery of the Subscription Agreement (the
"Escrow Funds").
 
3.   Rule 419

 

Rule 419 of the
Securities Act of 1933 requires that the net offering proceeds,
after deduction for underwriting compensation and offering costs,
and all securities to be issued (including those sold by a selling
shareholder) be deposited into an escrow or trust account (the
"Deposited Funds" and "Deposited Securities," respectively)
governed by an agreement which contains certain terms and
provisions specified by the rule. Under Rule 419, the Deposited
Funds (minus up to 10% which may be released to the Company upon
the meeting of the minimum offering) and Deposited Securities will
be released to the Company and to investors, respectively, only
after the Company has met the following three conditions: First,
the Company must execute an agreement for an acquisition(s) meeting
certain prescribed criteria; second, the Company must successfully
complete a reconfirmation offering which includes certain
prescribed terms and conditions; and third, the acquisition(s)
meeting the prescribed criteria must be consummated.

 

4.   Deposit and Investment of
Proceeds.

 

i. All offering
proceeds shall be deposited promptly into the escrow
account.
 


 



 





 



 

ii. 
Deposited proceeds shall be in the form of checks, drafts, or money
orders payable to the order of the escrow agent.

 

iii. Deposited
proceeds and interest or dividends thereon, if any, shall be held
for the sole benefit of the purchasers of the
securities.

 

iv. 
Deposited proceeds shall be invested in one of the
following:

 

A.            
An obligation that constitutes a "deposit," as that term is defined
in section 3(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;

 

B.            
Securities of any open-end investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 that holds itself out as a money
market fund meeting the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3),
and (c)(4) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act;
or

 

C.            
Securities that are direct obligations of, or obligations
guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United
States.

 

Absent written
investment direction, the Escrow Agent will invest the Escrow Funds
in the BB&T Business Investment Deposit Account type
169.

 

v.  No
interest or dividends shall be payable on the funds held in the
escrow account until the funds are released in accordance with the
provisions of this section.

 

vi. The Company
may receive up to 10 percent of the proceeds remaining after
payment of underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses and
dealer allowances permitted by Rule 419(b)(2)(i) of the Securities
Act exclusive of interest or dividends, only after such time as the
minimum offering has been fully completed and upon written request
of the Company.
 
5.   Deposit of
Securities

 

i.  All
securities issued, sold or to be sold in connection with the
offering, whether or not for cash consideration, and any other
securities issued with respect to such securities, including
securities issued with respect to stock splits, stock dividends, or
similar rights, shall be deposited directly into the escrow account
prior to commencement of the offering if already issued, or as soon
as they are sold and issued thereafter. The identity of the
purchaser of the securities shall be included on the stock
certificates or other documents evidencing such
securities.

 

ii. 
Securities held in the escrow account are to remain as issued and
deposited and shall be held for the sole benefit of the purchasers,
who shall have voting rights, if any, with respect to securities
held in their names, as provided by applicable state law. No
transfer or other disposition of securities held in the escrow or
trust account shall be permitted other than by will or the laws of
descent and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic
relations order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as
amended (26 U.S.C. I et seq.), or Title 1 of the Employees
Retirement Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), or the
rules thereunder.

 

iii. 
Warrants, convertible securities or other derivative securities
relating to securities held in the escrow account may be exercised
or converted in accordance with their terms; provided, however,
that securities received upon exercise or conversion, together with
any cash or other consideration paid in connection with the
exercise or conversion, are promptly deposited into the escrow
account.

 

6.   Post-Effective
Amendment

 

Once the
agreement(s) governing the acquisition(s) of a business(es) meeting
the above criteria has (have) been executed, Rule 419 requires the
Company to update the registration statement of which the
prospectus relative to the acquisition registration is a part with
a post-effective amendment. The post-effective amendment must
contain information about: the proposed acquisition candidate(s)
and its business(es), including audited financial statements; the
results of this offering: and the use of the funds to be disbursed
from the escrow account. The post-effective amendment must also
include the terms of the reconfirmation offer mandated by Rule 419.
The offer must include certain prescribed conditions (80% of the
investors must reconfirm the offering) which must be satisfied
before the Deposited Funds and Deposited Securities can be released
from escrow.
 


 



 





 



 

7.   Reconfirmation
Offering

 

The
reconfirmation offer must commence within five (5) business days
after the effective date of the post-effective amendment to the
registration statement. Pursuant to Rule 419, the terms or the
reconfirmation offer must include the following
conditions:

 

i.  The
prospectus contained in the post-effective amendment and any
amendment or supplement thereto will be sent to each investor whose
securities are held in the escrow account within five business days
after the effective date of the post-effective
amendment;

 

ii. Each
investor will have no fewer than twenty (20), and no more than
forty-five (45), business days from the effective date of the
post-effective amendment to notify the Company in writing that the
investor elects to remain an investor;

 

iii. If the
Company does not receive written notification from any investor
within 45 business days following the effective date of the
post-effective amendment, the pro rata portion of the Deposited
Funds (and any related interest or dividends) held in the escrow
account on such investor's behalf will be returned to the investor
within five business days by first class mail or other equally
prompt means. The Company will send written disbursement
instruction to the Escrow Agent including the amount of pro-rata
interest owed to the investor.

 

iv.  The
acquisition(s) will be consummated only if investors having
contributed 80% or more of the maximum offering proceeds elect to
reconfirm their investments; and

 

v. 
 If a consummated acquisition(s) has not occurred within
eighteen (18) months from the effective date of the registration
statement, the Deposited Funds held in the escrow account shall be
returned to all investors on a pro rata basis within five business
days by first class mail or other equally prompt means. The Company
will send written disbursement instruction to the Escrow Agent
including the amount of pro-rata interest owed to the investor if
any.

Anfield aims to be a supply contributor once the uranium price picks up








	Uranium focused Anfield Resources Inc (CVE:ARY) has raised $3mln via a private placing for project acquisition and development, and general working capital.

	The company will issue 50mln units at six cents each, it said in a brief statement.

	Each unit consists of one share and  a share purchase warrant, exercisable at 10 cents for a five years.

	Corey Dias, Anfield's chief executive, said the group was excited to have closed the financing.

	"These funds will allow us to both meet obligations related to Anfield's current projects and seek out further acquisition opportunities.

	"We remain very optimistic about the uranium market.

	"With Kazatomprom establishing a marketing arm in Europe in order to position itself as a swing uranium seller, we would expect to see less pressure on the spot price going forward.

	"In addition, the reduction in the number of tons of uranium to be sold per year by the U.S. [Department of Energy] should also have a positive effect on the uranium spot price.

	"Finally, we believe that the continued pace in the building of nuclear reactors in places such as China, India and the (United Arab Emirates) will spur a continuing rally in uranium prices, and entice both current and new producers to either maintain or expand their production efforts.

	"Anfield aims to be a supply contributor once the uranium price reflects this reality."
