Judge Chews Out Ex-CIFC Worker's Atty In Bias Suit



        By Max Stendahl



					Law360, New York (February 28, 2014,  3:28 PM EST) -- A New York federal judge on Friday upbraided a former CIFC Corp. employee's attorney in a discrimination and securities fraud suit against the company for persistently raising discovery issues, telling him at a hearing: "This is not a barroom or your office where you get to run the show.

Have been acquainted with Peter through several other transactions and find him to be both professional and knowledgeable about the transactions and super knowledgeable about the area.  Peter is a very nice, fun, and honest person. He has assisted me with other real estate questions or transactions that did not earn him a commission. I have and will continue to recommend him to friends and family.

Peter Glesyteen had previously been my broker / advisor on two previous real estate sales.  He was an enormeous asset in this last one as there were a number of issues pertinent to lot line ajustments and land use changes.  I would not hesitate to reccommend Peter to others as a competent and helpfull broker.  Thanks Peter!

We have nothing but positive feedback. We are really happy with the time and work Peter put in. He became like family.Peter helped navigate us through the complicated process of searching and purchasing real-estate. We would have otherwise been lost and frustrated. We plan on always working with him in future real-estate transactions. We would also, highly recommend him to others. Peter is THE BEST!!!

My Realtor, Peter Gleysteen, was very professional yet friendly.  He treated my property as a very important sale.  He went the extra mile in paying my repair contractors, required by my Mobile Park, upfront.  I would highly recommend the man if I had property to buy or to sell.This mobile home sold for full ask after repairs that were required by Westlake Village Mobile Park.  Smoothly handled by my Realtor Peter.

To whom it may concern,If you're looking for a real estate professional, Peter Gleysteen, is a great choice. Peter represented us in four transactions; two each as buyers and sellers. Whether you're buying or selling, the end result is much anticipated, but the process of getting there can be quite stressful. In every instance in our experience, Peter made the process as painless as possible.  His knowledge, advice and attention to detail were superb. Our last transation was accomplished after we had moved out of state. Peter arranged inspections, provided sage advice at every step, kept us posted on the progress along the way, and allowed us to complete the sale totally by "remote control!"  And in addition to his professional talents, we'd just like to say that it was an highly enjoyable association largely due to his engaging personality and witty sense of humor.  We can't thank Peter enough!Jim and Sharon Pape

We were recommend to use Peter Gleysteen at Century 21 from my in-laws, who'd dealt with Peter previously and thought him to be a very good agent.Peter Gleysteen was incredibly patient, knowledgeable, and efficient in dealing with a very difficult situation. You'd better hang on to Peter.  Honest, hard working and knowledgeable agents aren't that plentiful. I've bought several homes in the past, and Peter stands out as the best we've dealt with.  By dealing with Peter, I'd recommend Century 21 without hesitation.I dealt only with Peter in this transaction, but if I'd call to speak with him and he was out of the office, other agents would always be sure I had a contact number for him.My dealings with Century 21 J.C.Jones American dream was excellent.
