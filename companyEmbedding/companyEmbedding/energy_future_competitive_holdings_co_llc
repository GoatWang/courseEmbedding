The Future of Energy Future Holdings

On Oct. 3, 2016, TCEH Corp. (“TCEH”), including operating businesses Luminant and TXU Energy, emerged from the Chapter 11 financial restructuring process as a standalone company effected through a tax-free spinoff from parent company Energy Future Holdings Corp. (“EFH”). This emergence reflects satisfaction of all closing conditions, including certain regulatory conditions, included in TCEH’s Third Amended Plan of Reorganization, which was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Aug. 26, 2016.
On Nov. 4, 2016, TCEH announced its new name and brand: Vistra Energy.

More information is available at vistraenergy.com.
EFH and Energy Future Intermediate Holdings Corp., which owns an indirect 80 percent equity interest in Oncor, are proceeding toward Chapter 11 emergence on a separate schedule and have not yet emerged from the process. For more information concerning this ongoing process, please visit the case administrator website.
