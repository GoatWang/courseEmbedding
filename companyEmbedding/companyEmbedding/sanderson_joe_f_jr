Sanderson Farms, Inc. Reports Results for Second Quarter of Fiscal 2015

 LAUREL, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Sanderson Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFM) today reported results for its

      second fiscal quarter and six months ended April 30, 2015.

    


      Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 were $716.6 million

      compared with $660.7 million for the same period a year ago. For the

      quarter, net income was $71.2 million, or $3.13 per share, compared with

      net income of $51.0 million, or $2.21 per share, for the second quarter

      of fiscal 2014.

    


      Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2015 were $1,384.0 million

      compared with $1,245.6 million for the same period of fiscal 2014. Net

      income for the first half of the year totaled $137.7 million, or $6.00

      per share, compared with net income of $79.9 million, or

      $3.46 per share, for the first six months of last year.

    


      "The results for our second quarter of fiscal 2015 reflect lower grain

      costs and continued favorable demand for poultry products," said Joe F.

      Sanderson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Sanderson Farms,

      Inc. "Our net sales were 8.5 percent higher compared with the second

      quarter of fiscal 2014, reflecting increased volume offset by slightly

      lower market prices. Demand for chicken remains strong from our retail

      grocery store customers and, for the first time since 2008, we are able

      to say demand at food service has improved. Traffic and same store sales

      at food service establishments has improved across most all segments of

      the industry, aided by lower gasoline prices and improving macroeconomic

      factors.

    


      "Our profitability for the second quarter also benefited from lower feed

      costs," added Sanderson. "Feed costs in flocks processed decreased 11.8

      percent compared with last year's second fiscal quarter. Planting

      progress for 2015 grain crops is ahead of long term averages, and

      optimism for a second consecutive year of favorable production is

      supporting lower grain costs."

    


      According to Sanderson, market prices for poultry products were mixed

      during the second quarter compared with the same period last year.

      Compared with the second fiscal quarter of 2014, the average Georgia

      dock price for whole chickens was approximately 8.1 percent higher,

      boneless breast meat prices were approximately 4.4 percent lower, the

      average market price for bulk leg quarters decreased approximately 20.3

      percent, and jumbo wing prices were higher by 40.3 percent. The

      Company's average feed cost per pound of poultry products processed

      decreased 3.9 cents per pound, or 11.8 percent, compared with the second

      quarter of fiscal 2014, and prices paid for corn and soybean meal, the

      Company's primary feed ingredients, decreased 10.5 percent and 21.1

      percent, respectively, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2014.

    


      "We continue our start-up in Palestine, Texas, and it is going well,"

      added Sanderson. "We also continue the permitting process at the

      hatchery, processing plant and waste water treatment facility in St.

      Pauls, North Carolina, and expect to begin construction in June.

    


      "Looking ahead, we are optimistic as we head into the summer months and

      what is typically the peak demand period for chicken. Total grain costs

      remain below last year's prices, and demand for chicken products remains

      strong. Weekly broiler egg sets continue to run above last year's

      numbers, and breeder placements are higher. However, macroeconomic

      conditions continue to improve, and the market has absorbed the

      increased production well during the first half of our fiscal year.

      Market prices for boneless breast meat sold to our food service

      customers improved through April, and market prices for retail grocery

      store products remain at record levels. Regardless of market conditions,

      however, we will maintain our focus on maximizing our operating

      performance and sales execution," Sanderson concluded.

This press release includes forward-looking statements within the

      meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities

      Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Forward-looking

      statements are based on a number of assumptions about future events and

      are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that may

      cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs,

      projections and estimates expressed in such statements. These risks,

      uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those

      discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form

      10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2015, and the following:



      (1) Changes in the market price for the Company's finished products and

      feed grains, both of which may fluctuate substantially and exhibit

      cyclical characteristics typically associated with commodity markets.

    


      (2) Changes in economic and business conditions, monetary and fiscal

      policies or the amount of growth, stagnation or recession in the global

      or U.S. economies, any of which may affect the value of inventories, the

      collectability of accounts receivable or the financial integrity of

      customers, and the ability of the end user or consumer to afford protein.

    


      (3) Changes in the political or economic climate, trade policies, laws

      and regulations or the domestic poultry industry of countries to which

      the Company or other companies in the poultry industry ship product, and

      other changes that might limit the Company's or the industry's access to

      foreign markets.

    


      (4) Changes in laws, regulations, and other activities in government

      agencies and similar organizations applicable to the Company and the

      poultry industry and changes in laws, regulations and other activities

      in government agencies and similar organizations related to food safety.

    


      (5) Various inventory risks due to changes in market conditions,

      including, but not limited to, the risk that market values of live and

      processed poultry inventories might be lower than the cost of such

      inventories, requiring a downward adjustment to record the value of such

      inventories at the lower of cost or market as required by generally

      accepted accounting principles.

    


      (6) Changes in and effects of competition, which is significant in all

      markets in which the Company competes, and the effectiveness of

      marketing and advertising programs. The Company competes with regional

      and national firms, some of which have greater financial and marketing

      resources than the Company.

    


      (7) Changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily by

      the Company or required to be adopted by accounting principles generally

      accepted in the United States.

    


      (8) Disease outbreaks affecting the production performance and/or

      marketability of the Company's poultry products, or the contamination of

      its products.

    


      (9) Changes in the availability and cost of labor and growers.

    


      (10) The loss of any of the Company's major customers.

    


      (11) Inclement weather that could hurt Company flocks or otherwise

      adversely affect its operations, or changes in global weather patterns

      that could impact the supply of feed grains.

    


      (12) Failure to respond to changing consumer preferences.

    


      (13) Failure to successfully and efficiently start up and run a new

      plant or integrate any business the Company might acquire.

                                Sanderson Farms CEO, Joe Sanderson, Jr., Honored by Southern Miss College of Business                                



ARTICLE | TUE, 08/25/2015 - 10:34AM | BY VAN ARNOLDSay the name “Sanderson Farms” and two things immediately come to mind—chicken and success.  Because of the company’s entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to core values, the University of Southern Mississippi College of Business and its Advisory Council has chosen to honor Sanderson Farms and the company’s CEO, Joe Sanderson, Jr., as the 2015 Boardman Entrepreneur of the Year.The annual Boardman Entrepreneur of the Year is part of the Boardman Forum, which was established by Joseph Boardman of Gulfport, Miss. Those who receive the distinguished award display an innovative spirit, success in business and the integrity of the operation.“As a business person, it is an honor to receive an award recognizing entrepreneurs within the area,” said Sanderson. “Sanderson Farms’ focus on the values on which this company was founded has contributed to our success. This award is a reflection of the daily diligence and devotion of our employees and it is their work that is recognized by the university in choosing Sanderson Farms as the 2015 recipient.”Sanderson Farms’ roots trace back to 1947, when the company founders, D.R. Sanderson and his two sons, started a farm supply business to serve the local and surrounding communities. Today, Sanderson Farms is one of the nation’s leading food corporations, with annual sales of more than $2.77 billion and a weekly processing capacity of 10.625 million chickens.The company’s headquarters are located in Laurel, Miss., making it the only Fortune 1000 company headquartered within the state. In 2014, Forbes named Sanderson Farms as one of the 100 most trustworthy companies in America.“Sanderson Farms defines a clear exemplar for others in the quality of its values and people,” said Dr. Faye Gilbert, dean of the College of Business at Southern Miss. “Sanderson Farms has been entrepreneurial in its growth since the 1950s and the company has fostered numerous independent contractors who supply the company as they meet its standards for quality.”With the support of more than 800 independently contracted growers, 11 processing plants, nine hatcheries, eight feed mills and one prepared foods division, the company supplies poultry products to food retailers, distributors, restaurants and food service operators all across the United States and in more than 40 countries.“This entrepreneurial spirit feeds other entrepreneurs who benefit from this connection, and it is truly an honor to be able to recognize Joe Sanderson, Jr. and the people of Sanderson Farms,” added Dr. Gilbert.Prior recipients of the Boardman Entrepreneur of the Year Award include: Joseph Best, H&F Bread Company; Nancy Duarte, Duarte, Inc.; Sheldon Wolf, Spellex Corporation; Richard “Dick” Farmer, Cintas Corporation; Lucy Buffett, Lulu’s at Homeland Marina; Kathy Freeland, RGIl Technologies, Inc.; Hartly D. and Mary Peavey, Peavey Electronics; Leeland R. Speed, EastGroup Properties, Inc; Ross Perot, Perot Systems Corporation; Ronald “Buddy” McClain, McLain Sonic; Max Draughn, Cypress Pharmaceuticals; Bruce Rossmeyer, Daytona Harley-Davidson; Bill Hudson, Hudson Salvage, Inc.; and David Oreck, Oreck Corporation.
