Compliance Hot Topics for Bank Boards and Tips for Addressing Them
March 1, 2016



By Karen L. Grandstrand & Karla L. Reyerson
The regulatory compliance obligations of banks continue to grow, and with them come increased expectations from regulators regarding the role of bank directors in overseeing how their banks meet those obligations. As a result, board books are getting thicker, board meetings are becoming longer, and the line between the roles of management and the board is becoming increasingly difficult to define. Boards can meet regulatory expectations by staying abreast of compliance trends upon which examiners expect board members to focus and by acting strategically to oversee bank compliance efforts.

Capital Planning and Heightened Expectations – SR 09-4
December 2, 2015



By Karen L. Grandstrand
During the financial crisis, many banking organizations became subject to enforcement actions that required banks and bank holding companies (BHCs) to obtain approval from their regulators to pay dividends and redeem stock. At the same time, the Federal Reserve issued Supervision and Regulation Letter SR 09-4 (February 24, 2009, as revised March 27, 2009). This SR letter places ongoing restrictions on the payment of BHC dividends and the redemption of BHC stock even after enforcement actions are lifted.

Specialties of Grandstrand, Karen L. Attorney:

Attorneys
Banking & Investment Lawyers
Corporate Business Lawyers













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Banking & Investment Lawyers: Despite a changing economy, investment banking and law remain popular career paths for ambitious young people. Both careers offer the chance to make a lot of money right out of school. Moreover, prestige and upward mobility, two additional defining characteristics, attract the best and brightest into both investment banking and law.


Corporate Business Lawyers: A corporate lawyer is also known as In-House Counsel, Staff Attorney, Deputy General Counsel, General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer. Their primary objective is to serve the interests of the corporation, not the owners of the business or the officers who run it. In addition to legal counsel, they may also be called upon to provide business advice. They may practice other areas of law concerning mergers and acquisitions, trademarks, tax law bankruptcy, employment, securities, real estate or international commercial law.
