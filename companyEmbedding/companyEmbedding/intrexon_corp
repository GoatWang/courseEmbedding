                    Synthetic Biology






Synthetic Biology is the engineering of biological systems to enable rational, design-based control of cellular function for a specific purpose.  The programming of DNA and reformatting of genetic circuitry within cell platforms has created a paradigm shift whereby the analysis of biology is being supplanted by its synthesis.  This advancement has the potential to significantly impact approaches relied upon for some time across a variety of industries.

The ability to create and modify 'organic' materials on increasingly larger scales has occurred with a number of breakthroughs in genetic engineering including automated DNA sequencing, DNA synthesis, the advent of computational bioinformatics, and the creation of genetically modified organisms.  Today, Intrexon's expertise in designing DNA and constructing complex gene programs utilizing a modular, scalable approach with an embedded capacity to predict the viability of a biological solution, places it at the leading-edge of this growing synthetic biology discipline.

Can Intrexon Corp's Jaw-Dropping Growth Continue after Tuesday's 20% Jump?
Next-generation biotech Intrexon kept the growth going in 2014. What powered the company ahead? Where is the company headed? 











                Maxx Chatsko
            

                (TMFBlacknGold)



            
            Mar 5, 2015 at 9:12AM

Who said fame only lasts for 15 minutes?
Already on a tear entering 2015, synthetic biology leader Intrexon (NYSE:XON) roared higher after reporting full-year 2014 earnings earlier this week. A little over two months into the year, Intrexon stock is up over 80%.

The company is having no problem finding success by leveraging its technological know-how and making strategic acquisitions and partnerships to further exploit its biologic technologies. The result: amazing growth. While revenue and collaboration count will continue to soar higher in 2015, many investors may still be wondering what the heck is going on. What, exactly, does Intrexon do to deserve an 80% pop to start the year? Was 2014 really that good of a year?
What does Intrexon do?Intrexon leverages its technological know-how in engineering biology to create biotech products with healthcare, energy, food, consumer, and environmental applications for partners. It collects fees to conduct R&D and, if a product is successfully commercialized, collects royalty payments on sales of the product. The company also generates revenue from licensing its biotech tools (such as genetic parts) and services (such as DNA construction software). And although the product lineup isn't very deep today, Intrexon generates product revenue from selling biotech products that it owns outright.





Just the numbersThe year-over-year growth for Intrexon was impressive by all accounts -- even expenses and net loss. Here are the important numbers.

Source: SEC filings
Eight collaborators accounted for 82% of the company's collaboration revenue, which included seven healthcare partnerships. But while Intrexon is often revered for its growing pipeline of healthcare assets, 90% of its product revenue was derived "from the sale of pregnant cows, live calves, and livestock used in production." A further 79% of its service revenue was derived from cattle breeding programs.
Uh, what?





Don't forget, in July 2014 the company acquired Trans Ova Genetics, which is the largest supplier of bovine embryos used to breed livestock in the United States. The resulting cattle provide enhanced dairy and beef production and give farmers more bang for their buck. To be clear, synthetic biology isn't used for the livestock platform just yet, but it's a stark reminder that Intrexon's near-term financial performance will be determined outside of health applications, which typically have long product development cycles.
After zooming out from the year-over-year growth comparison to include longer time scales, the company's growth -- the primary reason for investor optimism -- is similarly impressive.

The company appears to have a handle on successfully growing its business, although the large losses incurred year after year serve as a reminder that Intrexon has a long way to go before breaking even -- let alone turning a profit for shareholders. It's a long-term investment that requires quite a bit of faith that big revenue streams will develop.





Management guidance for 2015Intrexon expects that existing collaborators will have up to 10 novel therapeutic candidates in clinical trials by the end of 2015. While a recent healthcare collaboration with Ziopharm and University of Texas MD Anderson aimed at developing a CAR-T oncology portfolio gets most of the media coverage, there are several other business-building events that will have a more immediate effect on the shareholders.
As mentioned above, Intrexon's acquisition of the nation's leading bovine embryo platform will provide a bulk of product revenue. Management expects food applications to deliver product and sales revenue of at least $100 million. It's important to note that doesn't include major contributions from AquaBounty Salmon (yet to be approved) or the recent acquisition of Okanagan Specialty Fruits (the owners of the now infamous Arctic Apple, which doesn't brown when sliced). Either way, the guidance calls for a giant leap from roughly $22 million generated from food applications in 2014.
What does it mean for investors?I must admit, my attitude about Intrexon is beginning to change for the bullish given the tangible, near-term growth opportunities. However, most of Intrexon stock's gains in 2015 are the result of optimism about the company's healthcare partnerships, which mostly amount to future potential right now. Let's face it: No headline about cattle breeding product and services revenue sent shares higher -- nor will it. Despite the growth opportunities in food applications for 2015 and the continuing string of new acquisitions, the market is out of sync with reality at the moment. For that reason, I would tread carefully around the company's $5 billion market cap.

Intrexon Corporation and Johnson Matthey plc Collaborate on Fermentative Production of Peptide-Based Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients
Jun 13 17
Intrexon Corporation and Johnson Matthey announced they have entered into an exclusive collaboration focused on the development of microbial strains for fermentative production of peptide-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Peptide-based APIs are used as highly effective treatments in numerous therapeutic classes. However due to their structural complexity, peptides often are costly and difficult to produce, requiring specialized equipment and reagents and lengthy synthetic sequences with low chemical yields. Through the collaboration, Intrexon will utilize its proprietary microbial hosts and fermentation processes for expression of peptides with high fidelity and titer. Intrexon will concentrate on the strain generation, initial fermentation and downstream isolation, as well as purification of the target APIs. Following this foundational work, Johnson Matthey (JM) will be responsible for product scale-up, formulation, and commercialization. Under the terms of the agreement, JM will have access to Intrexon's technologies and expertise for microbe-based fermentative production of specific target APIs, and Intrexon will receive a technology access fee and reimbursement for all research and development costs. The agreement also provides for milestone payments to Intrexon, as well as royalties based on net sales of commercialized products.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

					Full Description



Intrexon Corporation (Intrexon), incorporated on May 21, 2014, forms collaborations to create biologically-based products and processes using synthetic biology. The Company's domestic operations are in California, Florida, Maryland, and Virginia, and its primary international operations are in Belgium and Hungary. The Company designs, builds and regulates gene programs, which are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences that consist of genetic components. The Company's synthetic biology capabilities include the ability to control the amount, location and modification of biological molecules to control the function and output of living cells and optimize for desired results at an industrial scale. Its technologies combine the principles of precision engineering, statistical modeling, automation and production at an industrial scale. The Company's technologies include UltraVector gene design and fabrication platform, and its associated library of modular DNA components; Cell Systems Informatics; RheoSwitch inducible gene switch; AttSite Recombinases; Protein Engineering; Laser-Enabled Analysis and Processing (LEAP), and ActoBiotics platform.The Company's UltraVector platform enables design and assembly of gene programs, which facilitate control over the quality, function and performance of living cells. Its RheoSwitch inducible gene switch provides quantitative dose-proportionate regulation of the amount and timing of target protein generated, thereby providing another mechanism to closely control activity of a newly constructed gene program. Its AttSite Recombinases allow for stable, targeted gene integration and expression. Once cells have been engineered for the desired biological output, the LEAP automated platform can be used to identify and purify cells of interest, such as antibody expressing cells and stem cells. Furthermore, its ActoBiotics platform allows for targeted in situ expression of proteins and peptides from engineered microbes. Trans Ova Genetics, L.C. and subsidiaries (Trans Ova), a provider of bovine reproductive technologies and other genetic processes to cattle breeders and producers, is a subsidiary of the Company with primary operations in Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. ViaGen, L.C. (ViaGen), a provider of genetic preservation and cloning technologies, is a subsidiary of Trans Ova.The Company competes with ATUM, Inc., OriGene, Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Gen9, Inc., GenScript USA, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Novartis, University of Pennsylvania, Bluebird Bio, Celgene, Baylor College of Medicine, Five Prime, KitePharma, ViroMed Laboratories, National Cancer Institute, Juno Therapeutics, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Cellectis, Pfizer, Servier, Adaptimmune, GSK, Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Incyte, Merck and Roche.
