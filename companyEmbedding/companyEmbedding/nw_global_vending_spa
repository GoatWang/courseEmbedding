Art of the break.
N&W Global Vending is a world leader in the production of automatic snack and beverage vending machines and is a major international player in both the HoReCa (hotel, restaurant and café) and the Office Coffee Services sectors. 



A presence in 100 countries.
By combining the advantages of global presence with top-quality local knowledge, no company is as well placed as N&W when it comes to predicting international trends and it is by sharing this expertise with our customers that we're able to exploit new opportunities to our mutual advantage.
N&W has its headquarters and manufacturing sites in Italy, two partnerships in China, subsidiaries and branch offices in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, UK, USA, Brazil, Argentina, China, Singapore and Australia. Necta, Wittenborg and SGL branded products are used in more than 100 countries.
In countries where N&W has no direct presence, the company operates via a network of carefully selected agencies and distributors, all of whom benefit from rigorous, continuous training, a policy that guarantees efficient and consistent service. Thanks to its global presence, an extensive product range and a widespread sales network, N&W is a business model to which our competitors can only aspire.

Strong and enduring business relationships.
N&W's success is built on the bedrock of long standing relationships with a wide range of customers with whom we have enjoyed mutually beneficial relationships over many years.
As a result of our loyalty to each other, N&W has been able to structure and refine its production processes in order to provide customers with customised and bespoke products, both in terms of external design and internal configuration.
Such enduring relationships are the direct results of the dedication of our sales force,which consists of staff members who possess an intimate knowledge of individual customers and their particular requirements; staff members able to anticipate customer demands. Through our sales force, we proactively seek feedback from 'the front line', and it's this feedback that informs our R&D strategy.

BlueRed:
            getting EVA-DTS data from your vending machine has never been so quick and easy.
More
















01 / what is it


The BlueRed kit simplifies the recovery of EVA-DTS data from your vending machines and payment systems, using your smartphone, tablet or handheld device.


BlueRed BlueRed is an innovative system designed to ensure compliance with legal requirements
          for payment traceability simply and affordably.
          To meet the
          regulatory requirement and expand the possibilities for VM management, N&W
          Global Vending has developed an app that is capable of interfacing with ZiP and
          MiZiP payment systems and NECTA and WITTENBORG vending machines - or those of
          other manufacturers. 


Through a simple Bluetooth or IrDA connection, it is now possible
          to download all the data in EVA-DTS format straight to your mobile, tablet or
          handheld device and to share it from there - making it immediately available on
          your PC. A flexible and intuitive solution, BlueRed is available in "Fixed" and
          "Portable" versions, to suit your needs.









N&W Vending Machines
Other vending machines






BlueRed is an innovative system that facilitates the collection of statistical data in EVA-DTS format from ZiP and MiZiP payment systems - as well as from all NECTA and WITTENBORGvending machines - using a Bluetooth or IrDA. All you need to do to obtain all the data needed for legal compliance is pair your machine with the APP, which can be downloaded free from Play Store. Using a smartphone or tablet it’s also possible to access the advanced features of MiZiP: Programmer, set-up parameters and Maxi Box events. It’s a single solution that meets multiple needs and leads to substantial time savings.





In its “Portable”, BlueRed can also be used as
                  a bridge for connection between your smartphone, tablet or handheld device and
                  vending machines made by other manufacturers. All you need to do is enable the
                  IrDA communication protocol and pair the app and the BlueRed kit. It's a quick
                  and easy solution that allows you to monitor the accounting status of your
                  entire machine inventory efficiently - without incurring additional cost. 














02 / models


Fixed or portable? Choose the BlueRed kit that suits you best.


BlueRed is available in "Fixed" and ‘Portable’ versions in order to address all
          requirements: from the management of a small machine inventory, to situations
          involving wide geographical coverage.





Fixed

Easy to install and suitable for all NECTA and WITTENBORG
          vending machines, as well as ZiP and MiZiP payment systems, the Fixed version of BlueRed permits individual machines to be paired with your choice of mobile device: smartphone, tablet or handheld device.

Description:

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a U.S. Nationalization of PCT International Application No. PCT/EP2010/054071 filed 29 Mar. 2010, entitled “PRODUCT VENDING MACHINE,” which claims priority to Italian Patent Application No. TO2009A000241 filed 30 Mar. 2009, the contents of both of the foregoing applications are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by this reference.TECHNICAL FIELDEmbodiments of the present invention relate to a product vending machine.More specifically, embodiments of the present invention relate to a product vending machine of the type comprising a cabinet defining a space; and a number of movable parts comprising a front door for closing the space, and a number of trays arranged inside the space and for supporting respective numbers of products; each movable part being movable between a respective first and a respective second operating position.BACKGROUND ARTThe trays in vending machines of the above type are normally moved from a normal stowed position inside the space, to an extracted loading position, after first opening the door, for easy product loading by an operator.The relatively heavy weight of the trays when loaded poses the problem of enabling movement of one tray at a time, when loading the products, to prevent the machine from toppling over.In normal, i.e. closed-door, operating conditions, vending machines of the above type also pose the problem of securing the trays in their respective stowed positions, so that, in the event of violent shaking of the machine, e.g. by vandals, the trays are prevented from working loose and crashing into the door, thus damaging both the door and the trays, and possibly also toppling the machine.SUMMARYOne or more embodiments of the present invention provide a product vending machine designed to provide a straightforward, low-cost solution to both the above problems.According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a product vending machine. The product vending machine includes a locking device, and a column of rollers fitted along a guide with sufficient play to roll along the guide. The column is selectively engaged by one of a number of wedge members to eliminate the play and move the rollers into a compact configuration preventing insertion of the other wedge members. Each wedge member is movable with a relative movable part (e.g. a tray or a door) of the machine.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSA non-limiting embodiment of the present invention will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:FIG. 1 shows a view in perspective of a preferred embodiment of the vending machine according to the present invention;FIG. 2 shows a larger-scale detail of FIG. 1;FIGS. 3 and 4 show side views of a FIG. 1 detail in respective operating configurations;FIG. 5 shows a larger-scale view, with parts removed for clarity, of a detail in FIG. 4;FIG. 6 shows a section along line VI-VI in FIG. 5.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONNumber 1 in FIG. 1 indicates as a whole a product vending machine comprising a cabinet 2, which defines an internal space 3, and has two lateral walls 4, and a front door partly defined by a panel of transparent material. A hatch 6 in a bottom portion of door 5 closes a take-out bin (not shown) connected to the inner side of door 5, and can be opened from the outside to allow the user to remove a product selected on a pushbutton panel 7 on door 5, alongside the panel of transparent material.Inside space 3, machine 1 houses a number of product-supporting trays 8, which are positioned facing door 5, are arranged one over the other and spaced apart vertically, and extend between lateral walls 4, in respective substantially horizontal planes crosswise to lateral walls 4 and door 5. As shown in FIG. 1 and more clearly in FIG. 3, in the normal vending position, trays 8 occupy a rear portion of space 3, so as to define, between door 5 and the respective front ends of the trays facing door 5, a drop shaft 9 communicating with the take-out bin (not shown) underneath.With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, each tray 8 comprises a frame defined by a base 10 lying in a substantially horizontal plane; by two sides 11, each facing a respective lateral wall 4 of cabinet 2; and by a number of partitions 12 perpendicular to base 10 and door 5, and which divide tray 8 into a number of channels, which may be of different widths, extend perpendicular to door 5, and each house a number of products arranged in one or more columns, depending on the width of the channel.Each channel has powered conveying means, which are activated selectively, in use, to feed a relative column of products along the channel in a travelling direction D perpendicular to door 5, and feed the products one at a time into drop shaft 9.Each channel of the top tray 8 in FIG. 2, for example, has, for each column of products, a spiral conveyor 13 for feeding the relative products in direction D to drop shaft 9; and each channel of the bottom tray 8 in FIG. 2 has, for each column of products, a belt conveyor 14 for feeding the relative products in direction D to drop shaft 9 via a respective selective product release device 15. Both spiral conveyor 13 and belt conveyor 14 and relative release device 15 are known and commonly used in the product vending machine industry, and therefore not described in detail.To enable the operator to load the products easily onto trays 8, each tray 8 is mounted between lateral walls 4, so that, when door 5 is opened, the tray can be moved in direction D from the normal vending position (top tray in FIG. 4) to a loading position (bottom tray in FIG. 4), in which tray 8 projects partly from space 3, across drop shaft 9.To permit this movement, the frame of each tray 8 comprises two lateral guides (not shown), each of which is integral with an edge of the frame facing a corresponding lateral wall 4, is engaged in sliding manner by base 10, and removably engages at least two fastening cavities 16, which are coplanar with each other and with the cavities 16 engaged by the other lateral guide, and lie in a horizontal plane perpendicular to door 5. More specifically, the cavities 16 in each lateral wall 4 are arranged in at least two parallel vertical columns (only one shown in FIG. 2), in each of which, cavities 16 are equally spaced with a given centre distance P, so the height of each tray 8 can be adjusted, in use, by the operator simply moving tray 8 to a different level, as required.As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 5, machine 1 also comprises a locking device 17, which, when door 5 is closed, locks all the trays 8 in their respective vending positions, and, when door 5 is open and one tray 8 is in the loading position, locks all the other trays 8 in their respective vending positions, i.e. only allows one tray 8 at a time to be extracted.Locking device 17 comprises a rolling member retainer defined by a tubular guide 18 connected rigidly to a lateral wall 4 and extending vertically between trays 8 and drop shaft 9; and a column of rollers 19 fitted in transversely rolling manner to guide 18.More specifically, as shown in FIG. 5 and in more detail in FIG. 6, guide 18 is defined by a tubular C-section profile defining an internal cavity 20, which is coaxial with a vertical axis 21, is open outwards through a longitudinal slit 22 on the side facing the opposite lateral wall 4 to the one supporting guide 18, and is closed at its axial ends by two stops 23 (only the top one of which is shown in the drawings) defining respective stops of guide 18.Each roller 19 has an axis 24 perpendicular to axis 21, and comprises two end portions 25, 26 of the same diameter, and of which portion 25 is housed in transversely rolling manner inside cavity 20; and a smaller-diameter centre portion 27, which connects portions 25 and 26, and engages slit 22 in transversely rolling manner to guide roller 19 along guide 18.When locking device 17 is idle (not shown), the column of rollers 19 is seated loosely in guide 18, with an amount A of play, along axis 21, equal to roughly the diameter of a roller 19. Being free to roll along slit 22, rollers 19 therefore rest by gravity one on top of the other and on top of the bottom stop 23 (not shown), and a gap of size A, equal to the amount of play, is formed between the top stop 23 and the top roller 19 in the column.Locking device 17 also comprises wedging means designed to selectively fit between rollers 19 to eliminate the play between rollers 19 and so move the column of rollers 19 into a compact operating configuration, in which the column of rollers 19 forms a barrier in front of trays 8, to prevent trays 8 in the vending position from moving into the loading position.As stated, when door 5 is open, the wedging means are activated, by moving a tray 8 into the loading position, to lock all the other trays 8 in the vending position, or are activated by closing door 5, to lock all of trays 8 in the vending position.To achieve the first of the above locking modes, the wedging means comprise, for each tray 8, a rod 28, which is connected rigidly to the side of tray 8 facing the lateral wall 4 supporting guide 18, extends in a horizontal direction parallel to said lateral wall 4, and has a sharp end 29, which is positioned with its tip facing guide 18, lies in the tangency plane of two rollers 19, and is aligned with the contact line of the two rollers 19. Consequently, when one of trays 8 is moved, together with respective rod 28, from the vending to the loading position (FIG. 4), rod 28 is inserted between the two rollers 19 aligned horizontally with it, so as to raise the column of rollers 19 above tray 8. Each rod 28 is of a thickness substantially equal to the amount A of play, so that, when rod 28 is inserted between two rollers 19 aligned with it, the top roller 19 in the column is pushed against the top stop 23, and rollers 19 assume the compact configuration preventing insertion of another rod 28.As shown in FIG. 2, depending on the type of tray 8 and the space available on it, rod 28 may be located on a top edge of the side 11 facing guide 18 (as in the case of tray 8 with belt conveyor 14), or on the outside of side 11, on a lateral edge of base 10 (as in the case of tray 8 with spiral conveyor 13).Regardless of where rod 28 is located on tray 8, it is important that end 29 be substantially aligned horizontally with the contact line of two rollers 19, so that rod 28 fits smoothly between the two rollers 19 when tray 8 is moved into the loading position.Accordingly, and since, as stated, trays 8 can be positioned at different heights inside space 3 by means of cavities 16, the centre distance of rollers 19 equals the centre distance of cavities 16. Once the correct position of rod 28 on tray 8 is established, the above alignment is therefore achieved for each height of tray 8 inside space 3.To lock all of trays 8 when door 5 is closed, the wedging means comprise a wedge member 30 located between door 5 and guide 18, close to the top stop 23, and defined by a substantially rectangular plate. This has a projection 31 on the side facing guide 18, and is hinged to wall 4 to oscillate, about a pin 32 parallel to axes 24, between a rest position (FIGS. 4, 5), assumed when door 5 is open and in which wedge member 30 does not interfere with guide 18 or the column of rollers 19, and a work position (FIG. 3) assumed when door 5 is closed and trays 8 are all in the vending position, and in which wedge member 30 is pushed against guide 18 by a fixed push member 33 integral with door 5, so that projection 31 completely fills the gap between top stop 23 and the top roller 19 in the column, thus eliminating the play between guide 18 and rollers 19, which therefore assume the compact configuration, so that, when door 5 is closed, none of trays 8 can move out of the vending position.Operation of machine 1 is clear from the above description, with no further explanation required.To conclude, it should be pointed out that, in a version not shown, as opposed to being located along drop shaft 9, guide 18 may be located in the rear of space 3, alongside trays 8. In which case, transmission members are interposed between each tray 8 and respective rod 28, and between push member 33 and wedge member 30, so that movement of tray 8 moves rod 28, and movement of push member 33 moves wedge member 30, as described above.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Thank you for visiting Vending World on the web. Many other sites sell only new mechanical machines. This is because new 'commercial' grade vending machines are very expensive. We only sell refurbished 'commercial' grade vending machines. We do this  because most locations do not need new machines. Our rebuilt machines sell for 20% to 50% the cost of new vending machines. Are you thinking about buying 'low cost combo machines or bulk vending'? Please see our new users pages before you buy. Compare our commercial grade equipment for the vending machine business.

Most of our rebuilt equipment is listed on our website. Many other sellers of used or new vending equipment make you call them for prices. All of our machines can be bought with online ordering. Why buy used vending machines? You can buy our refurbished vending equipment for about the same price as used. You can see prices clearly marked and you can see pictures of the actual models. Many items we have built in small quantities due to limited space in our showroom area. What's on sale this month? Please visit our sale page to view our current specials. click here to view our on sale items



Our large warehouse-showroom 'usually' has over 100 finished machines in stock, the largest inventory of finished machines on the west coast. We are only about 3 miles from Ontario International Airport. If you are in the Southern California area please visit our facility and showroom. We have just moved to a 'State of the Art' building and have a huge inventory of machines and parts for the vending business. Anyone can sell used vending equipment on the internet, whether they stock them or not. We have been selling vending machines since 1968, so we have a lot of experience in  the vending business. "Taking Vending to a Higher Level"


Thank you for making us the largest seller of refurbished and used vending equipment in California 19 years on the internet 1998-2017.


We sell vending machines and parts from the following fine manufactures on this site: Automatic Products, Coinco, Conlux, Crane Dixie Narco, Crane National, Mars Electronics, National Vendors, Rowe, USI, Vendo Sanden. We sell parts including coin mechs, dollar validators and more. Vending World does not provide any tech support for machines bought from other suppliers. Customers have asked us how we can provide the quality of refurbishment that we do at such low pricing. Some have even asked if our machines have a warranty, the answer is yes we do provide a warranty but it is a 'limited parts warranty'. Many problems that occur during the warranty period happen right away due to the shipping process. A part might get shaken or knocked loose causing it to fail. Should that occur we simply send you a replacement part, that is easy to install and you are back working again. Many times customers call when they first receive our machines as well due to not understanding how to price the machines etc. Please be sure to read the programming books that we include with each machines prior to calling for tech support as we have found that over 92% of calls are user error or the customer not having an understanding of how to operate the machine.


We carry bottle drink, cold food and glass front candy and snack vending machines. We also sell coin mechs, dollar bill validators and other parts for the vending business. Why buy new? You can buy refurbished for 20% to 50% of the price of new. No one on our staff speaks SPANISH or any language except English, please remember that if you need to call us for information or technical support.


Vending machines are a great way to make a very nice second income. That is why so many small businesses opt to own a machine of their own, as it can quickly pull in residual income. There is no real hard work that is required once the machine is in place, and all you really have to do is make sure that it stays stocked and collect the money. There will be those very rare occasions where your machine may require a little bit of maintenance, but it’s not difficult to find an affordable professional in your area who can quickly take care of any issues that might arise. Owning a vending machine is not strictly limited to those who own a small business, but if you don’t, then you are going to have to find a location in which to place it. That is where VendingWorld can help, as we used to operate vending routes so we have quite a bit of experience in this field - we put together a list of vending machine locators and we will generally be able to give you pointers and advice as you start building your routes. Snack and soda machines are the most popular, as well as being the easiest to use. There is a definite familiarity that consumers have with these types of machines, and when they are in the right location, they can turn into a money making machine very quickly. Everyone experiences bouts of thirst or hunger throughout the course of the day, and having a vending machine nearby will help them make a decision to purchase a snack or a soda. Some people like to start out a little smaller, and if that is the case then you should take a look at our monthly specials as well as our grade B used vending machines. We are committed to making sure that your foray into the vending machine business is a successful one, which is why we are always available to answer any questions or concerns that you may have.

Our large warehouse-showroom 'usually' has over 100 finished machines in stock, the largest inventory of finished machines on the west coast. We are only about 3 miles from Ontario International Airport. If you are in the Southern California area please visit our facility and showroom. We have just moved to a 'State of the Art' building and have a huge inventory of machines and parts for the vending business. Anyone can sell used vending equipment on the internet, whether they stock them or not. We have been selling vending machines since 1968, so we have a lot of experience in  the vending business. "Taking Vending to a Higher Level"


Thank you for making us the largest seller of refurbished and used vending equipment in California 19 years on the internet 1998-2017.


We sell vending machines and parts from the following fine manufactures on this site: Automatic Products, Coinco, Conlux, Crane Dixie Narco, Crane National, Mars Electronics, National Vendors, Rowe, USI, Vendo Sanden. We sell parts including coin mechs, dollar validators and more. Vending World does not provide any tech support for machines bought from other suppliers. Customers have asked us how we can provide the quality of refurbishment that we do at such low pricing. Some have even asked if our machines have a warranty, the answer is yes we do provide a warranty but it is a 'limited parts warranty'. Many problems that occur during the warranty period happen right away due to the shipping process. A part might get shaken or knocked loose causing it to fail. Should that occur we simply send you a replacement part, that is easy to install and you are back working again. Many times customers call when they first receive our machines as well due to not understanding how to price the machines etc. Please be sure to read the programming books that we include with each machines prior to calling for tech support as we have found that over 92% of calls are user error or the customer not having an understanding of how to operate the machine.


We carry bottle drink, cold food and glass front candy and snack vending machines. We also sell coin mechs, dollar bill validators and other parts for the vending business. Why buy new? You can buy refurbished for 20% to 50% of the price of new. No one on our staff speaks SPANISH or any language except English, please remember that if you need to call us for information or technical support.


Vending machines are a great way to make a very nice second income. That is why so many small businesses opt to own a machine of their own, as it can quickly pull in residual income. There is no real hard work that is required once the machine is in place, and all you really have to do is make sure that it stays stocked and collect the money. There will be those very rare occasions where your machine may require a little bit of maintenance, but it’s not difficult to find an affordable professional in your area who can quickly take care of any issues that might arise. Owning a vending machine is not strictly limited to those who own a small business, but if you don’t, then you are going to have to find a location in which to place it. That is where VendingWorld can help, as we used to operate vending routes so we have quite a bit of experience in this field - we put together a list of vending machine locators and we will generally be able to give you pointers and advice as you start building your routes. Snack and soda machines are the most popular, as well as being the easiest to use. There is a definite familiarity that consumers have with these types of machines, and when they are in the right location, they can turn into a money making machine very quickly. Everyone experiences bouts of thirst or hunger throughout the course of the day, and having a vending machine nearby will help them make a decision to purchase a snack or a soda. Some people like to start out a little smaller, and if that is the case then you should take a look at our monthly specials as well as our grade B used vending machines. We are committed to making sure that your foray into the vending machine business is a successful one, which is why we are always available to answer any questions or concerns that you may have.

Thank you for visiting Vending World on the web. Many other sites sell only new mechanical machines. This is because new 'commercial' grade vending machines are very expensive. We only sell refurbished 'commercial' grade vending machines. We do this  because most locations do not need new machines. Our rebuilt machines sell for 20% to 50% the cost of new vending machines. Are you thinking about buying 'low cost combo machines or bulk vending'? Please see our new users pages before you buy. Compare our commercial grade equipment for the vending machine business.

Most of our rebuilt equipment is listed on our website. Many other sellers of used or new vending equipment make you call them for prices. All of our machines can be bought with online ordering. Why buy used vending machines? You can buy our refurbished vending equipment for about the same price as used. You can see prices clearly marked and you can see pictures of the actual models. Many items we have built in small quantities due to limited space in our showroom area. What's on sale this month?
