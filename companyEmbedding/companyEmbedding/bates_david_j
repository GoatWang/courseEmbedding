 Educational Background



 
Class of 1984 


University of Pennsylvania - The Wharton School

                  The Wharton School is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wharton was the world’s first collegiate business school and the first business school in the United States. It was established in 1881 through a donation of Joseph Wharton.                




 


The George Washington University

                  The George Washington University actively engages Washington, D.C., and the world. Their location in the heart of Washington places them at the core of U.S. government, policy and law. They sit where the worlds of science, technology, media and the arts converge. Their students and faculty have the unparalleled opportunity to study and work alongside leaders and practitioners in every discipline, to take part in the interchanges that shape our community and the world.
The George Washington University was created in 1821 through an Act of Congress, fulfilling George Washington’s vision of an institution in the nation’s capital dedicated to educating and preparing future leaders.
Today, GW is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia. They have more than 20,000 students—from all 50 states, the District and more than 130 countries—studying a rich range of disciplines: from forensic science and creative writing to international affairs and computer engineering, as well as medicine, public health, the law and public policy.
GW comprises three campuses—Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon in Washington, D.C., and the GW Virginia Science and Technology Campus in Ashburn, Va.—as well as several graduate education centers in the metropolitan area and Hampton Roads, Va.

Overview



When author David J. Bates left the active duty military at age twenty-two in 1998, he had no idea what he was going to do with the rest of his life. A fortuitous meeting on the interstate led him to Dallas, Texas, where he was tasked to establish a Leadership Cadet Corps at the middle-school level to boost student performance. In Narrow It Down, Bates details the insight he gained during the establishment and facilitating of that program using his experience gained during his military service. Through the eyes of an educator, this combination of educational guide and memoir discusses the lessons he learned in this educational setting and touches on specific priorities that enable educators to focus on what's important in the classroom and in life. Bates shares ideas that could create a better educational system-one that encourages pro-active thinking to solve problems. Praise for Narrow It Down "Narrow It Down is a book about making a difference in the things you can control and focuses on raising the bar when it comes to the educational system. ... Programs like Coach Bates' can significantly help in keeping young North Texans-the future of our great state and nation-in school, and I applaud him on his efforts to build this program." -Congressman Pete Sessions

                                Just read this book and what great timing, I will explain. I live in New Jersey and was flooded out of my home by huricane Sandy, I losted this book in the flood. While at my daughters house last week I saw her copy so I spent the afternoon reading it. It just so happens that I was going to run a support group for the 1st time that night. I was so inspired after reading this book and had a new perspective on the influence I was going to have on the group. It is a great read and makes you think about your world and the part you play in it. I would give it 5 stars and highly recommand it.
