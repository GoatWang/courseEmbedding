			Matthew T. McClane retired in 2002 as President and Chief Executive Officer of Kearny Bank after serving in that position since 1994 and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Kearny Financial after serving in those positions since 2001. After graduating from St. Peter's College and serving in the U.S. Army Reserves, he began his career with Kearny Bank in December of 1967. His many years of service included a wide range of responsibility for operations and human resources at Kearny Bank, which together with his past duties as Chief Executive Officer of Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank bring a special insight and knowledge of personnel challenges along with financial, economic and regulatory challenges we face. This acute insight and knowledge makes him well suited to educating the Board on these matters. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of Kearny Bank and Kearny Financial and remains active in the community as a member, past President and current Secretary of the Optimist Club of Kearny, New Jersey.

Matthew T. McClane

            Smashwords Interview
        



                        What is the greatest joy of writing for you?                    

                        I enjoy the journey that writing  provides.  Weather non-fiction or fiction you never know what you will learn or where you'll end up in the end.                    



                        What inspires you to get out of bed each day?                    

                        My family is my main drive; my desire to support and provide for them is why I have embarked on this new journey.

You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.

Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks.

On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
