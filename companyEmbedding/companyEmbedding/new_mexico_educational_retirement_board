Straight talk on educational retirement plan--Santa Fe New Mexican
Both of my parents are retired educators, so my family  understands the importance of secure retirement benefits for educational  employees. The New Mexico Educational Retirement Board (NMERB) plays an  important role in the lives of our 46,000 retirees and 60,000 active members.  They and the Legislature have entrusted NMERB with providing secure retirement  benefits to all of New Mexico’s public educational employees and their  beneficiaries.
I consider this a sacred trust. The NMERB Board of  Trustees and I have consistently taken a proactive position to ensure that  future retirees have the benefits they deserve, have earned and substantially  contributed toward. Earlier assumptions for the plan never anticipated the  increasing life spans of our retirees nor the stagnating number of educational  employees to pay into the plan (the number of employees paying was virtually  the same in mid-2000 and mid-2016).

NMERB Investors Spot Opportunity--posted 07/12/17
From "Chief Investment Officer" Asset Allocation July 10,1017
Capital relief trades allow banks to meet their burdens for capital 
          buffers without selling off loans or cutting back on lending. Instead, 
          other investors take on the credit risk for some potential loan losses 
          through contracts. As the broader market for so-called synthetic 
          collateralizations booms after a much-needed healing following the 
        financial crisis, some investors see compelling opportunities.
“It’s
          like selling insurance on bank portfolios,” says Bob Jacksha, CIO of 
          the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, which manages approximately
          $12 billion. “They are looking at more than just the economic return of
          the profile, and they might be willing to take our insurance at better 
          rates than they otherwise would for those considerations.” Maintaining 
          customer relationships and staying in the good graces of regulators are 
        chief among them, he said. Click here to follow full article.
 
Pension fund  finishes year at all time high 
From “Business Matters” column by  Bruce Krasnow, Santa Fe New Mexican,  Feb. 13, 2017 
With all  the bad news about public pension funds, the New Mexico Educational Retirement  Board fund is reporting an 8.5 percent return for the 2016 calendar year.
The fund  reached assets of $11.7 billion and grew by $939.8 million over the year after  fees. Net returns have been 8.5 percent over the last five years after fees and  9 percent since 1983.
 “The  most important point is that our 8.5 percent return for the year exceeded our  actuarial target of 7.75 percent,” said Bob Jacksha, chief investment officer.
 Educational  Retirement Board chairwoman Mary Lou Cameron said the board has made a  strategic decision to diversify its portfolio, and this has reduced volatility  over time. 
The  educational retirement pension plan covers close to 60,000 active members  currently paying into the system and 46,000 retirees, ranging from public  school teachers, administrators and staff to college faculty and staff.

Your estimated NMERB annual benefit



Your estimated NMERB monthly benefit






                      This calculator only does the simple Formula A  as described on the Retirement Benefits page.   							 If you would like   							 to calculate the "B" and "C" options please sign on to the ERB's Member Access and   							 use your calculator. 




If you have any technical questions or problems, please contact our office at 1-866-691-2345, 1-866-691-2345. 

 Calculator limitations
 The calculator will not:
-  Verify your eligibility for a benefit. 
- Determine your future salary.  (It is up to you to estimate what the average of your highest five consecutive years of salary will be at retirement.  If   the actual final average salary is different than the one you entered,   your benefit estimate will be different than the actual benefit.) 
-  Determine   your projected service credit at retirement. (You must project the   number of years of service credit that you will have at retirement. If   the service credit that you enter is incorrect, your estimate will not   be the same as your actual benefit.)  

Calculator Disclaimer

If   the results of your estimate differ from your official benefit   calculation at retirement, the official calculation based on the ERA,   will be used.  The accuracy of your estimate depends on how closely the variables you enter on the input screens match those at retirement.  The calculator provides unofficial estimates only.  
I have   read and understand this disclaimer and I agree that any estimates   provided by the calculator will be done so under these conditions.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Some faculty and professional employees of New Mexico public universities and community colleges have the option of participating in the Alternative Retirement Plan (ARP), a defined contribution plan. Within the first 90 days of employment in an ARP eligible position at a pubic post-secondary school, you can opt to participate in either the ERB Defined Benefit, or "regular," Plan or the ARP.
In the defined contribution plan, individual accounts are set up for participants, and benefits are based on contributions plus investment earnings. ARP participants direct their own investments, and retirement benefits are tied to the value of the assets in the account at retirement Upon retirement, ARP participants have three options:





a monthly annuity based on the retiree's estimated life span,





payments received over a fixed term on years, or



a lump sum payout.


To see current ERB contribution rates, click here.
The ERB receives 3% from the contributions paid by ERB employers to cover the actuarial impact on the Defined Benefit Plan attributable to employees participating in the ARP.
If you terminate your employment with a New Mexico university or community college, you may roll over the ARP account balance to another qualified retirement plan or withdraw the balance. If the distribution is not transferred directly from your ARP account into another qualified retirement plan, it is subject to federal income tax and a 10% penalty for early withdrawal. Contact your carrier for information on rollovers and distributions.
As a result of legislative changes in 2009, ARP participants now have the opportunity to switch to the ERB Defined Benefit Plan. After you have made contributions to the ARP for seven years, you have a 120-day window to enroll in the Defined Benefit Plan. Eligibility begins on the first day of the month after the date on which you have made seven  years of contributions to the ARP. The seven year mark is the only opportunity you will have to switch to the Defined Benefit Plan. If you make the change, you cannot switch back to the ARP.
If you opt to move to the Defined Benefit Plan, the money in your ARP account will remain there. You must contribute to the Defined Benefit Plan for five years to vest in the plan and be eligible for retirement benefits. You cannot purchase service credit for time in which you were enrolled in the ARP; however, the seven years of participation in the ARP will count toward eligibility requirements to retire under the ERB Defined Benefit Plan.

NM Educational Plan (NMERB)

The NM Educational Retirement Plan is provided by the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board (NMERB).

Eligibility
Employees working more than 10 hours per week (.25 FTE) (excludes graduate assistants and student employees). Eligible employees automatically become a member of the Educational Retirement Board (ERB) plan when they begin employment with any entity covered by the Educational Retirement Act (ERA). Membership in the ERB is a condition of employment. Upon employment, the ERB creates an individual account for the employee. Contributions toward retirement are deducted from the employee’s earnings each pay period automatically. All new hires are required to complete an ERB Beneficiary form and the Employee Data form. NMERB Changes Effective July 1, 2014

Employees earning $20K or less contribute 7.9% of gross salary by payroll deduction and the university contributes 13.9%. [For more information on this, please refer to 2009 House Bill 2, which stated “For purposes of the General Appropriation Act of 2009 and any other act of the first session of the forty-ninth legislature, no employee shall be deemed to have an annual salary greater than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) unless the employee’s full-time-equivalent base annual salary is greater than that amount or unless the employee’s base hourly wage is greater than nine dollars fifty-seven and nine-tenths cents ($9.579).”]
Employees earning more than $20K contribute 10.7% and the university contributes 13.9%.

Individuals who work more than 0.25 of FTE (25% of Full Time Equivalent) for the following entities are covered by the ERB’s retirement programs:

Public schools (including public charter schools, i.e: chartered by the local school board or the New Mexico Secretary of Education)
Universities
Junior or community colleges
Public technical and vocational institutions
New Mexico School for the Deaf
New Mexico School for the Visually Handicapped
Regional educational cooperatives
New Mexico Activities Association


Retirement Eligibility
Employees hired before July 1, 2010 may retire when ONE of the following conditions are met:

age 65 with 5 or more years of service; or
when age plus years of service equal 75 (penalties apply for retirees under age 60); or
any age with 25 years of service.

Employees hired on or after July 1, 2010 may retire when ONE of the following conditions are met:

age 67 with 5 or more years of service; or
when age plus years of service equal 80 (penalties apply for retirees under age 65); or
any age with 30 years of service.

Employees hired on or after July 1, 2013 may retire when ONE of the following conditions are met:

age 67 with 5 or more years of service; or
when age plus years of service equal 80 (penalties apply for retirees under age 65); or
30 years of service; permanent actuarial reduction of benefit if begin receiving benefit before age 55.

Benefits are based on three components – your Final Average Salary (FAS), your years of both earned and allowed service credits, and the 2.35% factor.



FAS  x  service credit  x  .0235 = gross annual benefit



Your final average salary is the higher of:

Your average annual earnings for the last 20 calendar quarters (60  months) prior to retirement, or
Your highest average annual earnings for any 20 consecutive calendar quarters.

As part of the FAS calculation, your average annual earnings are based on quarterly earnings but will be annualized by fiscal year. Request an official estimate of retirement benefits from the NMERB at least 6 months prior to retirement, but no more than 1 year before retirement. The request for estimate form can be found at: http://www.nmerb.org/Downloadable_Forms.html.
Individuals planning for retirement before 55 years of age should consult with their tax advisor as additional penalties may apply.
The plan has special provisions for out-of-state credit and military credit. Please contact the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board for plan details at www.nmerb.org/. For updated ERB News, please visit the newsletter website at http://www.nmerb.org/News_letters.html.

Refund Information 

If you terminate your employment with an ERB-covered entity prior to retirement, you are entitled to request a withdrawal or rollover of your member contributions. If you opt to withdraw or rollover your member contributions, you must take out the entire amount and you will no longer have service credit on account with ERB. For account balance, you can log into your ERB account and click on Statement of Account. You can also contact ERB at 1-866-691-2345 or send and email to ERB-memberhelp@state.nm.us.
 
To refund or rollover your contributions, complete the Request for Refund and/or Rollover form. If you are requesting your funds within 90 days of termination, your employer must certify that you are no longer working. Employer contributions  are not refundable.
 
The lump sum and/or rollover amount of total member contributions include interest. The interest rate is based on the five-year Treasury bill as of March 31 of each year.  The current interest rate  1.73%.  The ERB does not pay interest on  contributions paid into the ERB Fund prior to July 1, 1971. Refunded ERB contributions may be directly rolled over into an IRA or other qualified plan (you must ask your provider if it will receive this type of funds) without penalty. The ERB is required by statute to withhold 20% of the total distribution and forward it to the IRS as a withholding.  The IRS may also have an additional early withdrawal penalty of 10% if you are under age 59.5. You may want to consult with your tax advisor before taking a refund or transferring it to another qualified retirement plan. The ERB cannot offer tax advice and is not liable for the tax effects of a refund or rollover.
 
If a member dies prior to retirement, contributions are refunded to his or her beneficiary with interest.  If your beneficiary is under the age of 18, payment will not be made until the minor has reached age 18 or until the court appoints a guardian of the minor's estate.
 
If you have taken a refund but wish to reinstate credit for your contributions to the Defined Benefit Plan, you may pay the Educational Retirement Board the withdrawn amount plus interest for the period during which the funds were withdrawn.  If you received a refund of your contributions and have no service credit as of July 1, 2010, and decide you want to reinstate credit for your contributions to the Defined Benefit Plan, you will be subject to the new retirement eligibility rules. You may not take a refund if you have already applied for retirement and have completed your final retirement documents. 
 
 For more information please see the ERB Member   Handbook or email ERB-memberhelp@state.nm.us.

Membership 
From The Handbook



You automatically become a member of the Educational Retirement Board (ERB) plan when you begin employment with any entity covered by the Educational Retirement Act (ERA). Links to the ERA and regulations adopted by the ERB can be found at  "Educational Retirement Act."
Upon your employment, the ERB creates an individual account for you. You must complete a Beneficiary Designation form (ERB Form 42) before a notary and return it to the ERB in order to activate your retirement account. Contributions toward your retirement are deducted from your earnings each pay period and credited to your ERB account. 
Membership in the ERB is a condition of employment. Employees covered under the ERB are referred to as "members," and employers are referred to as "local administrative units or LAUs." In the member handbook, they are also referred to as "ERB Employers."
If you are a short-term substitute teacher, and intern or student teacher, or work 25% or less of a full-time equivalent (FTE) position, you are not eligible to participate in the ERB. A short-term substitute teacher is a substitute who works less than six continuous weeks in a single substitute teaching assignment. 
Individuals who work more than 0.25 of FTE (25% of FTE) for the following entities are covered by the ERB's retirement programs:

Public schools (including public charter schools, ie: chartered by the local school board or the New Mexico Secretary of Education)
Universities
Junior and community colleges
Public technical and vocational institutions
New Mexico School for the Deaf
New Mexico School for the Visually Handicapped
Regional educational cooperatives
New Mexico Activities Association
Certain employees at state agencies that provide an educational program (ie: Department of Corrections, Public Education Department, Department of Health, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, Educational Retirement Board). This applies only if the employee filling a position is required to be a certified educator. Other employees at these agencies participate in the Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) plan. 

The ERB Annual Report, click here to see annual report, includes a list of all participating employers. 
Some college and university positions qualify for ERB's Alternative Retirement Plan (ARP). Click here for more information.

NMERB History
Now & Then

Today, the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board (NMERB) is   an organization of approximately 65,000 active members, 49,000 inactive members, and 45,000 retirees.  The NMERB   manages one of the highest-ranking public pension plans in the country   in terms of return on investment.  
The New Mexico Legislature provides the employer’s   portion of the monthly contributions  to a member’s account.  The NMERB is a state agency,   accountable not only to its members and its board, but also to the   Legislature and governor.  It is self-funded, meaning that the operating   budget for the association is provided from the return on investment of   the fund.  The NMERB uses no money from the state’s general fund. Board   members and agency personnel pride themselves on a conservative and   careful approach to investing, and in-house procedures provide economy.   Board members and NMERB personnel who have built the organization take   great pride in NMERB’s sound actuarial management, its efficient   operations and its member-oriented focus. 
Retirement in New Mexico hasn’t always been funded or   structured as it is today.  What we take for granted now didn’t exist   in the early 1920s - in fact, no pension plan whatever existed for any   public servant. 
The first serious efforts to create a pension plan   for New Mexican educators took place in 1925 when Gov. Arthur Hannett   and the Legislature passed landmark legislation establishing the first   pension plan of any kind for public servants. On March 19, House Bill   178, An Act Relating to the Retirement of Faculty Members in State Educational Institutions, and Providing for the Payment of Annuities Thereto,   was passed marking the beginning of an 81-year history that has formed   the present New Mexico educational retirement system.   
 
An informal beginning
Durinng the 1925 landmark session,  legislature John Hall provides insight on the ways the Legislature was   governed:
“The committees of both houses were powerful and at   times highly arbitrary in their conduct. No calendars were kept,   committees met at the call of the chair and no minutes of the   proceedings were preserved. Furthermore, there is nothing in the state   Constitution or in the rules of either house to compel a committee to   consider or report a bill ... “All members of both houses either spoke   or understood English.   However, interpreters were available in the   lower house, the House of Representatives, when a member of Spanish   descent insisted that his argument could be better made in his mother   tongue. Copies of the bills were printed in English and Spanish.” 
Despite these irregularities, the 1925 retirement act   was ground-breaking legislation.  House Bill 178, the state’s first   pension plan for public servants, was created in a small state of   400,000, geographically remote from the centers of policy making at that   time – a remarkable accomplishment.
 
Who thought up this retirement idea anyway?
Millionaire and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie   deserves credit for helping establish a political and social climate   that recognized the value of educators. He was an unusual man.  As his   fortune grew, he came to believe that surplus personal wealth should be   used for service to humanity, in particular for educational purposes,   and to protect and promote democracy.  Carnegie created the Teachers’   Insurance and Annuity Company in 1905 with a donation of $10 million to   provide a means for college professors to receive retirement pensions. 
 His foundation provided “free” pensions;  no   contributions were required from the teacher.  As time went on, it   became clear that no infusion of dollars could provide free pensions for   all college teachers, and in 1918, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity   Association, (TIAA) was formed to provide annuities under a contributory   system.  This company became a model for modern-day pension plans, and   TIAA-CREF still exists today as a provider of annuities to university   educators in America. 
 
A rocky beginning
The first retirement legislation in New Mexico also   applied only to faculty members at the university level.  It was to be   fully funded by the Legislature, with no contribution required from the   employee or university.   Strangely, an important feature of the bill   was language that made it clear that potential retirees had no right to   benefits, and that university boards of regents had the power to grant   or deny an applicant benefits without having to offer a reason for   refusing any petitioner.   Another quirky feature of New Mexico’s first   pension plan was the absence of a legislative appropriation to provide   retirement benefits, even though the legislation stated that funding   would be provided to the operating budgets of universities. This   oversight did not stop universities from retiring some faculty. Boards   of regents had minds of their own when deciding to award pensions. 
In May 1925, Charles E. Hodgin, a University of New   Mexico professor of education for most of his career, was approved for   retirement, thus making him the first educational retiree and the first   educator to receive a state public pension in New Mexico.  Hodgin   happened to be the vice president of the University of New Mexico at the   time of his retirement.  A second retirement under this act was awarded   to a Mary H. Eckles by the Board of Regents of the  New Mexico State   Teacher’s College (now New Mexico Western University.)  Hodgin was the   first person in any public profession to be granted a public   pension in New Mexico, and he and Mary Eckles are the only recorded   retirees in that year.          
Two years later, the Legislature removed the quirks   from the retirement legislation for university faculty, funded it, and   went on to pass a pension plan for firemen in municipalities of more   than 5,000 people.   Public school employees, however, were still   without a pension plan.          
The legislative bodies of 1929 and 1931 did not   consider the subject of retirement (the Legislature met once every two   years at this time in New Mexico history).   In 1933, new legislation   was passed providing a retirement plan for all public school and university teachers. This plan provided for joint   funding from the Legislature and contributions made by teachers in the   following amounts:



Salary
 Contribution


Less than $100 per month
 $ .50


$100 per month 
$1.00


$100-$150 per month
$1.50


More than $150 per month
$ 2.00




However, no one actually retired under this   comprehensive new plan because its requirement for contributions from   teachers conflicted with the 1925 act which provided “free” retirement   for university professors, but that act had never been repealed.  The   state now boasted two retirement plans for educators, with the   provisions of one contradicting those of the other.  
At this point, the Legislature charged the State   Board of Education with implementing the 1933 Act - however, they did   not act.  According to Ken Davis, past director of the ERB, “The state   board minutes for the four years that this law was on the books,   1933-37, do not reveal one single mention of this retirement law.  In   view of the inaction of the state board, it is probable that very few   teachers even knew about the law.”
Senate Bill 45, passed in February 1935, enacted yet another retirement bill for teachers.  But this one was the first really   workable public school retirement plan. Part of it is reproduced below:
An Act Relating to the Retirement of Public School Teachers and Providing an Annuity or Pension Therefore
Senate Bill No. 45:  Approved February 28, 1935.
Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of New Mexico:          
Section 1. The Board of County Commissioners of any   county in this state shall have the power by a majority vote thereof to   retire any public school teacher who shall have taught in the public   schools of the state of New Mexico for a period or periods aggregating   thirty-five years, and who shall, in the opinion of a majority of such   Board, be in needy circumstances; such persons shall thereafter during   the remainder of his or her life, receive an annuity or annual pension,   payable monthly, of not to exceed one-half of the maximum annual salary   received by such person during the five years next preceding his or her   retirement hereunder; provided that such annuity not exceed $1,200 per   annum.
Section 2. The amount of such annuities shall be   included in the annual budget of the county in which the Board of County   Commissioners has retired such persons, and a sufficient levy to pay   the same shall be made annually on the real property in said county by   the Board of County Commissioners.
 
A decades-long ripple effect
The philosophy of the Legislature regarding public   school funding took a dramatic turn in 1935  with the passage of the   Emergency School Tax Act which established that financing the public was   the state’s responsibility rather than primarily a local function. 
In 1937, there was finally just one retirement plan   in effect after the Legislature repealed previous acts relating to   retirement.  The 1937 Retirement Act would govern teachers’ retirement   in the state for the next 20 years. 
There was just one problem.
The 1937 Retirement Act did not require contributions   from members, and this decision by policy makers turned out to have a   significant effect on the long-term actuarial soundness of the fund in   the decades that followed.  (Today, higher employer contributions   approved by the Legislature in 2005 under Senate Bill 181 guarantee the   solvency and actuarial soundness of the NMERB fund.)
Another retirement bill, SB 184, known as the   Seyfreid Bill, had also been introduced during the 1937 session which   provided for member contributions of five percent of salary that would   have been matched by the state.  The benefit paid to a retiree would be   the amount that the employer and employee contributions together with   interest earned.  The Seyfried bill was actuarially sound, and would   have resulted in a stronger retirement system.  However, other factors   came into play that prevented its passage. 
One of those factors was the emergence of the New   Mexico Education Association (NMEA) as a powerful player in the debate   over how to structure retirement in New Mexico.  The only education   association for many years until the arrival of the NM American   Federation of Teachers in the 1970s, the NMEA came out in favor of a   different bill, declaring that the average teacher would be unable to   understand the provisions of the Seyfried bill. In truth, NMEA was far   more likely to support a bill that required no contribution from   teachers than the Seyfried bill, which did, so the 1937 retirement act   remained in effect for the next two decades.
 
The Educational Retirement Board is launched 
The first meeting of the Educational Retirement Board   was held in March 1941.  Although the board, headed by Superintendent   of Public Instruction Grace Corrigan, was not established by law until   the legislative session of 1945, it operated de facto serving the needs   of members during the war years, apparently without problems. Policy   wasn’t set by the board, but retirements were approved. 
The Legislature did not pass any laws affecting   public retirement in 1943 - the first session in 10 years that did not   pass some sort of retirement legislation affecting public schools.    Perhaps in the thick of World War II concerns, members of the   Legislature had other matters on their minds. 
In the postwar years, numerous policy changes were   made in the Educational Retirement Act, primarily in the way the   retirement act was administered by the ERB, and to its amendments. Chief   among these changes was bringing all educational agencies under one   retirement act which was accomplished in 1945. Full credit was given to   returning service men and women for the time they spent in the armed   forces, and the ERB was finally made a legal entity.  By law,   composition of the board was to be; the state superintendent of public   instruction, the state educational budget auditor, the state treasurer,   the president of the New Mexico Education Association and the president   of the Emeritus Employee’s Association of New Mexico.  The board’s   makeup remains essentially the same today with the addition of a member   elected by the American Association of University Professors and two   people appointed by the governor, minus the budget auditor, a position   that no longer exists.  
The NMERB begins investing
The first recorded investment by the New Mexico state   treasurer of the retirement fund, which at that time was $106,434,   was ordered by state school superintendent Georgia Lusk, who also headed   the NMERB, in May of 1944.  Apparently no one had given thought   previously to putting retirement fund dollars to work.  This was fairly   typical of the unsophisticated approach to the retirement business   practiced by the board during these early years.  
The NMERB engaged an actuary to make a report on the   fund’s solvency in 1949, but at the board’s only meeting in 1950, NMERB   Director Floyd Santisteven reported that the study had not been   accomplished because several of the districts were tardy in their   reporting. This easy-come-easy-go attitude seems improbable by today’s   thinking, especially in light of the strict requirements under which the   present-day system functions.   The ERB today requires an actuarial   study each year, a yearly outside audit of the agency, and close   oversight by both the legislative and administrative arms of state   government. Amazing to consider that, in 1949, no records of incoming   or outgoing moneys were recorded at all, nor were any detailed records   kept of the calculations or amounts each pensioner received.
Major changes to the state’s retirement act took   place during the 1950s following an actuarial study that revealed that   funds assets as of June 30, 1950 were $7,941,180, and liabilities were   listed at $55,371,799 - a whopping $47,430,427 deficit. The report   made several strong recommendations to put the program back on track.    Recommendations included increased contributions from the state,   employee contributions and that complete and detailed records of the   system and membership be maintained.  It also stated an annual valuation   should be made to determine the true condition of the system.
The board’s response to these suggestions was that,   “it might try to implement some of them,” and, “The board saw no   immediate necessity to set up a contribution for a special fund for   liquidating the accrued liability….” (Davis & Trimmer 1976).  
In the end
The process of setting the fund on the road to a   sound actuarial basis was begun by an ad hoc state reorganization   committee in 1952. This committee recommended that the state Legislature   create a committee to study state retirement funds.  The study’s   findings were clear:  employee contributions were essential to the   soundness and solvency of the state’s retirement plan for education   employees.  With the support of the NMEA behind it, the New Mexico   Legislature passed the Educational Retirement Act of 1957, a true   retirement plan with policy in place that would put the fund on a firm   actuarial footing for the next several decades. 
In January 2005, the Legislature’s House Education   Committee was told that the ERB projected a $2.4 billion shortfall; its   asset-to-liability ratio was about 75 percent and that, if uncorrected,   the fund faces “severe problems.”  News of the projected shortfall   spread rapidly throughout the state to public school employees,   legislators, and the general public even though the NMERB made clear that   the pension fund is able to pay the current level of benefits, without   contribution changes, for the next 20 to 25 years. 
In response to the   projected shortfall, NMERB moved swiftly to gain the support of the   NM Legislature resulting in the Legislature’s   decision to increase the state’s and member's contribution  thereby adding long term improvement.

Independent Contractors 


 
If you provide services to an ERB employer as an independent   contractor, your earnings will have no impact on your pension. However, it is   critical that both you and the employer follow IRS rules and regulations that   distinguish between employees and independent contractors. ERB retirees must   complete the NMERB   Independent Contractor Determination Application form, and submit it   to ERB for review by the legal department prior to beginning employment.
 
Independent Contractors and the Return to Work (RTW) program
In order to qualify for the RTW program you will still be  required to layout 12 months without working for a Local Administrative Unit (LAU). This includes any  independent contracting work you do for an NMERB affiliate. For example, consider if you  retire in June and then you immediately begin working as an independent  contractor with a school district until August 31. You will have to  layout at least 12 months without working starting September 1 to participate  in the RTW program.   
 
 For more information please see the ERB Member   Handbook or email ERB-memberhelp@state.nm.us.

Service Credit 


 
Earned Service Credit
Employee members of ERB's Defined Benefit Plan receive service credit for each calendar quarter during which they are employed by an ERB employer and make contributions to that plan. Credit is also granted for service prior to July 1, 1957, the Defined Benefit Plan's effective date. 
Members who take a paid sabbatical or leave of absence continue to make contributions and therefore continue to earn service credit. Members who take unpaid sabbaticals or leaves of absence do not earn service credit. 
 
Allowed Service Credit 
The Educational Retirement Act allows certain types of service credit to be purchased and credited to a members account. This "allowed" service credit, limited to a total of five years, will be included in the computation of the retirement benefit and counted toward retirement eligibility based on the Rule of 25. Allowed service credit does not apply towards "air time" if you plan to retire under one of the age and service options however, it will apply when calculating retirement under the age and service options. (See "Retirement Eligibility" on page 10 of the member handbook for additional information.) 
You may purchase up to five years of service credit if you have service in the US military or worked for any of the following institutions: 

NM private schools that are accredited by the Public Education Department (PED)
A public or accredited private school, college or university in any other state or territory of the US
The Federal Educational Service in NM, including Bureau of Indian Affairs schools

Members who can combine military service and any of the other three categories listed above may purchase a maximum of 10 years of service credit (up to five of allowed out of state or private school and up to five of military.) 
In order to purchase service credit, you must file an application with the NMERB, and your former employer must verify your employment. Applications are available on the download forms link on this web page. 
The cost to purchase service credit is based on an actuarial cost that reflects your length of service and current earnings. Please contact the NMERB to get an estimate of what it would cost you to purchase allowed service credit. You have two options for purchasing allowed service credit:

You may make a lump-sum payment to the NMERB
You may roll over or transfer retirement contributions from another retirement plan, including another 401(a) plan, a tax-sheltered annuity 403(b) plan or an IRA, to the NMERB's Defined Benefit Plan to the extent allowed by the Internal REvenue Service (IRS). 

You should roll over or transfer funds from the other retirement plan directly to the NMERB to avoid adverse tax consequences. Please consult with a tax advisor on the possible tax effects of a rollover or other transfer. The NMERB cannot provide tax advice and is not responsible for the adverse tax effects of the rollover or transfer method chosen by an individual. 
Military Service 
Members who previously served in the military or the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service may purchase up to five years of allowed service credit in the Defined Benefit Plan. Service credit for active duty may be purchases after five years of employment by an NMERB-covered entity. The cost to the member is the combined employee and employer contributions at the current rates. To qualify for allowed service credit, you must have received an honorable discharge and provide the NMERB with a copy of your DD-214. 
The NMERB is in full compliance with the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Re-Employment Rights Act (USERRA) which ensures that individuals who service in the Armed Forces, Reserves, National Guard or other "uniformed services" are:

not disadvantaged in their civilian careers because of the service
promptly re-employed in their civilian jobs upon their return from duty
not discriminated against in employment based on past, present, or future military service

If you are in the National Guard or Reserves and are called to active duty while employed by an NMERB-covered entity, your pension rights under the Defined Benefit Plan are preserved under the terms of USERRA. This means that for purposes of service credit, you will be treated as if you had no break in employment with he NMERB-covered entity. while you are on active duty, neither you nor your NMERB employer makes contributions to the plan. This "free" military  
  period relieves you from having to make contributions while you are away from your civilian career.
