Xatmep: Package Insert and Label InformationBy Silvergate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Last revised: 30 April 2017
XATMEP- methotrexate solutionSilvergate Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 WARNING: SEVERE TOXIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY  Methotrexate can cause the following severe or fatal adverse reactions. 
 Monitor closely and modify dose or discontinue methotrexate as appropriate. 
 •  Bone marrow suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]   •  Serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]   •  Renal toxicity and increased toxicity with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]   •  Gastrointestinal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]   •  Hepatic toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]   •  Pulmonary toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]   •  Hypersensitivity and dermatologic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]   •  Methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity, including fetal death.  Use in pJIA is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Consider the benefits and risks of XATMEP and risks to the fetus when prescribing XATMEP to a pregnant patient with a neoplastic disease. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with XATMEP [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].   1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE  1.1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  



XATMEP is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a multi-phase, combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen.
1.2 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  XATMEP is indicated in the management of pediatric patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  2.1 Important Administration Information  XATMEP is intended for oral use only.  Use another formulation of methotrexate for alternative dosing in patients who require dosing via other routes of administration.  Instruct patients and caregivers that the recommended dose should be taken weekly, as directed, and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Overdosage (10)].
It is important that XATMEP be measured with an accurate measuring device [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Patient Counseling Information (17)].  A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device.  A pharmacist can provide an appropriate device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose.
2.2 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  The recommended starting dose of XATMEP, in multi-agent combination chemotherapy maintenance regimens, is 20 mg/m2 given one time weekly.  After initiating XATMEP, continuation of appropriate dosing requires periodic monitoring of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count to assure sufficient drug exposure (that is to maintain ANC at a desirable level) and to adjust for excessive hematological toxicity.
2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  The recommended starting dose of XATMEP is 10 mg/m2 given one time weekly.
Dosages should be tailored to the individual patient and adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal response.  Although there is experience with doses up to 30 mg/m2 /week in pediatric patients, doses greater than 20 mg/m2 /week may result in a significant increase in the incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions, especially bone marrow suppression.  Doses between 20 and 30 mg/m2 /week (0.65 to 1 mg/kg/week) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered by an alternative route using another formulation. 
Therapeutic response usually begins within 3 to 6 weeks and the patient may continue to improve for another 12 weeks or more.  
Certain side effects such as mouth sores may be reduced by folate supplementation with methotrexate in pJIA.
2.4 Evaluations Prior to Starting Methotrexate  Assess hematologic, hepatic, and renal function before beginning, as well as periodically during and before reinstituting, therapy with XATMEP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.7, 5.14)].  Exclude pregnancy in females of reproductive potential before starting XATMEP [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
2.5 Handling Information  XATMEP is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.1 
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS XATMEP is a clear yellow to orange oral solution that contains 2.5 mg of methotrexate per milliliter.
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS XATMEP is contraindicated in the following:
 • Pregnancy in patients with non-malignant diseases.  XATMEP can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. • Patients with severe hypersensitivity to methotrexate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression  XATMEP suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.  
Obtain blood counts at baseline and periodically during treatment.  Monitor patients for possible clinical complications of bone marrow suppression.  Provide supportive care and modify dose or discontinue XATMEP as needed.
5.2 Serious Infections  Patients treated with XATMEP are at increased risk for developing life-threatening or fatal bacterial, fungal, or viral infections including opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, invasive fungal infections, hepatitis B reactivation, tuberculosis primary infection or reactivation, and disseminated Herpes zoster and cytomegalovirus infections.  
Monitor patients for the signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XATMEP and treat promptly.  Consider dose modification or discontinuation of XATMEP in patients who develop serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
5.3 Renal Toxicity and Increased Toxicity with Renal Impairment  XATMEP can cause renal damage including acute renal failure.  Monitor renal function to decrease the risk of renal injury and mitigate renal toxicity.
Consider administration of glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (> 1 micromole per liter) and delayed clearance due to impaired renal function [see glucarpidase Prescribing Information].
5.4 Gastrointestinal Toxicity  XATMEP can cause diarrhea, vomiting, stomatitis, hemorrhagic enteritis, and fatal intestinal perforation.  Patients with peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis are at a greater risk of developing severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 
Interrupt or discontinue XATMEP and institute appropriate supportive care as needed.
Unexpectedly severe and fatal gastrointestinal toxicity can occur with concomitant administration of XATMEP (primarily at high dosage) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
5.5 Hepatic Toxicity  XATMEP can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure.  Avoid use of XATMEP in patients with chronic liver disease.  
Assess liver function prior to initiating XATMEP and monitor liver function tests during treatment.  Interrupt or discontinue XATMEP as appropriate.  Transient asymptomatic acute liver enzyme elevations are common and are not predictive of subsequent hepatic disease.  Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis.
Other risk factors for hepatotoxicity include alcoholism, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, previous significant exposure to liver toxins, history of liver disease, family history of inheritable liver disease, persistent abnormal liver chemistry findings, duration of therapy, and advanced age.
5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity  Methotrexate-induced pulmonary toxicity including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis and irreversible or fatal cases can occur at all dose levels.  Monitor patients for signs of pulmonary toxicity and interrupt or discontinue XATMEP as appropriate.  
5.7 Hypersensitivity and Dermatologic Reactions  Severe, including fatal, dermatologic reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, can occur with methotrexate. Discontinue XATMEP if severe dermatologic reactions occur. 
Anaphylaxis can occur with methotrexate. If anaphylaxis or any other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue methotrexate and institute appropriate therapy.  Methotrexate is contraindicated for use in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity. 
Radiation dermatitis and sunburn may be “recalled” by the use of methotrexate.
5.8 Secondary Malignancies  Secondary malignancies can occur at all dose levels of methotrexate.
There have been instances of lymphoproliferative disease associated with low-dose oral methotrexate which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate without institution of antineoplastic therapy.  Discontinue XATMEP first and institute appropriate treatment if the lymphoma does not regress.
5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  Based on published reports and methotrexate’s mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman. In pregnant women with non-malignant diseases, methotrexate is contraindicated. Consider the benefits and risks of XATMEP and risks to the fetus when prescribing XATMEP to a pregnant patient with a neoplastic disease. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after the final methotrexate dose [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].
5.10 Ineffective Immunization and Risks Associated with Live Vaccines  Immunization may be ineffective when given during XATMEP therapy.  
Immunization with live virus vaccines is not recommended.  There have been reports of disseminated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunization in patients receiving methotrexate therapy.
5.11 Effects on Reproduction  Based on published reports, methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction.  It is not known if the infertility is reversible in affected patients. Discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
5.12 Increased Toxicity Due to ThirdSpace Accumulation  Methotrexate can exit slowly from third‑space accumulations resulting in prolonged terminal plasma half-life and toxicity.  Evacuate significant third-space accumulations prior to methotrexate administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
5.13 Soft Tissue and Bone Toxicity with Radiation Therapy  Concomitant radiation therapy increases the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis associated with methotrexate.
5.14 Laboratory Tests  Closely monitor patients undergoing XATMEP therapy so that toxic effects are detected promptly. In general, monitoring of the following parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.5)].
Increase monitoring frequency during initial dosing, dose changes, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration). 
 Liver Function Tests 
Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy.  Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
 Pulmonary Function Tests 
Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
5.15 Risk of Improper Dosing  Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that the recommended dose is taken one time weekly, as directed, and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Overdosage (10)].
Advise patients to measure XATMEP with an accurate milliliter measuring device.  Inform patients that a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, which can result in serious adverse reactions [see Overdosage (10)].  Advise patients to ask their pharmacist to recommend an appropriate measuring device and for instructions for measuring the correct dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION


WARNING: SEVERE TOXIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY

 See full Prescribing Information for complete boxed warning. 


Methotrexate can cause the following severe or fatal adverse reactions.
Monitor closely and modify dose or discontinue methotrexate as appropriate.
Bone marrow suppression [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]
Renal toxicity and increased toxicity with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Gastrointestinal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Hepatic toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Pulmonary toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
Hypersensitivity and dermatologic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]
Methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity, including fetal death. Use in pJIA is contraindicated
in pregnancy. Consider the benefits and risks of XATMEP and risks to the fetus when prescribing
XATMEP to a pregnant patient with a neoplastic disease. Advise females and males of reproductive
potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with XATMEP [see Contraindications
(4), Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].



INDICATIONS

Xatmep is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor indicated for the:



treatment of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a multi-phase, combination chemotherapy
maintenance regimen
management of pediatric patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) who have had
an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including
full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).



ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Contraindications:


Xatmep is contraindicated in pregnant patients with non-malignant disease and in patients with severe
hypersensitivity to methotrexate.


Warnings and Precautions:
 See full Prescribing Information for additional information.



Xatmep suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia,
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Obtain blood counts at baseline and periodically; monitor patients for
complications of bone marrow suppression.
Patients treated with Xatmep are at increased risk for developing life-threatening or fatal bacterial, fungal, or viral
infections, including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, invasive fungal infections, hepatitis B reactivation,
tuberculosis (primary or reactivation), disseminated Herpes zoster and cytomegalovirus infections.
Renal toxicity and increased toxicity with renal impairment, including acute renal failure. Consider administration
of glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (>1 micromole/liter) and delayed
clearance due to impaired renal function.
Xatmep can cause diarrhea, stomatitis, vomiting, hemorrhagic enteritis, and fatal intestinal perforation. Patients
with peptic ulcer disease and ulcerative colitis are at increased risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
Unexpected severe and fatal gastrointestinal toxicity can occur with concomitant use of NSAIDs.
Hepatic toxicity: severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure
can occur. Avoid use of Xatmep in patients with chronic liver disease.
Pulmonary toxicity: acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis and irreversible or fatal cases can occur at all
dose levels.
Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis or other serious hypersensitivity reactions. Discontinue methotrexate.
Severe, including fatal, dermatologic reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, skin necrosis, erythema multiforme can occur. Radiation dermatitis and
sunburn may be “recalled.”
Secondary malignancies can occur at all dose levels. Lymphoproliferative disease has been reported with
low-dose oral methotrexate which regressed when methotrexate is withdrawn.
Methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered during pregnancy. Consider the
risks and benefits of Xatmep and risks to the fetus when prescribing to a pregnant patient with a neoplastic
disease. Effective contraception should be practiced by patients of reproductive potential while receiving Xatmep
therapy, and for 3 and 6 months afterwards for males and females, respectively. Xatmep is contraindicated in
non-neoplastic disease.
Effects on reproduction: Methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction.
It is unknown if the infertility is reversible in affected patients.
Increased toxicity in third-space accumulation. Evacuate significant third-space accumulation prior
to methotrexate administration.
Immunizations may be ineffective when given during Xatmep therapy.
Immunization with live virus vaccines is not recommended during Xatmep therapy.
Concomitant radiation therapy increases the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis associated
with methotrexate.
Closely monitor laboratory parameters for hematology, renal function, and liver function. Increase monitoring
during initial dosing, dose changes, and during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels
(e.g., dehydration).
Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially
if baseline measurements are available.
Risk of improper dosing: Once-weekly dosing is appropriate. Fatal toxicity has been reported with daily dosing.
An accurate milliliter measuring device should be used. Inform patients that a household teaspoon is not an
accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage.
Advise women not to breastfeed during Xatmep therapy.



Adverse Reactions: See full Prescribing Information for additional adverse reactions.



Most common adverse reactions are ulcerative stomatitis, leukopenia, nausea, abdominal distress, and elevated
liver function tests.
Other frequently reported reactions are malaise, fatigue, chills and fever, dizziness, and decreased resistance
to infection.
The approximate incidences of adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients with JIA treated with oral, weekly
doses of methotrexate (5 to 20 mg/m2/week or 0.1 to 0.65 mg/kg/week) were as follows (virtually all patients
were receiving concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and some also were taking low doses of
corticosteroids): elevated liver function tests, 14%; gastrointestinal reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea),
11%; stomatitis, 2%; leukopenia, 2%; headache, 1.2%; alopecia, 0.5%; dizziness, 0.2%; and rash, 0.2%. Although
there is experience with dosing up to 30 mg/m2/week in JIA, the published data for doses above 20 mg/m2/week
are too limited to provide reliable estimates of adverse reaction rates.

Drug Interactions:


Penicillins may reduce the clearance of methotrexate; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate
with concomitant hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity have been observed with methotrexate. Monitor
patients accordingly.
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been reported to increase bone marrow suppression in patients receiving
methotrexate. Monitor patients accordingly.
Hepatotoxins: May increase hepatotoxicity. Monitor patients receiving concomitant hepatotoxins for signs
of hepatotoxicity.
Probenecid may reduce renal elimination of methotrexate; consider alternative drugs.
Theophylline: May decrease theophylline clearance. Monitor theophylline levels.

ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
Contraindications:


Xatmep is contraindicated in pregnant patients with non-malignant disease and in patients with severe
hypersensitivity to methotrexate.


Warnings and Precautions:
 See full Prescribing Information for additional information.



Xatmep suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia,
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Obtain blood counts at baseline and periodically; monitor patients for
complications of bone marrow suppression.
Patients treated with Xatmep are at increased risk for developing life-threatening or fatal bacterial, fungal, or viral
infections, including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, invasive fungal infections, hepatitis B reactivation,
tuberculosis (primary or reactivation), disseminated Herpes zoster and cytomegalovirus infections.
Renal toxicity and increased toxicity with renal impairment, including acute renal failure. Consider administration

Compliance Program











Compliance Program
A key component of our commitment to corporate responsibility and doing business with integrity


A key component of our commitment to corporate responsibility and doing business with integrity




Compliance Program 

Comprehensive Compliance Program Description
I. Introduction
Silvergate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Silvergate) is committed to conducting its business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and to the highest standards of ethical conduct. To this end, we have established and will maintain a Comprehensive Compliance Program (“Compliance Program”) in accordance with the OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (the “OIG Guidance”), published by the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Our Compliance Program is a key component of our commitment to adhering to the highest standards of corporate responsibility and fostering a culture of compliance that places a premium on doing business with integrity.

The purpose of our Compliance Program is to (1) prevent, detect, and remediate violations of laws, rules, regulations, as well as Silvergate policies and procedures and (2) promote a culture of the highest ethics within the organization. It is Silvergate’s expectation that employees will comply with our Code of Business Conduct and the policies and procedures established in support of such Code. As the OIG Guidance recognizes, however, the implementation of a Compliance Program cannot guarantee the elimination of improper employee conduct.

Silvergate has described below the fundamental elements of our Compliance Program. As recognized in the OIG Guidance, we have tailored our Compliance Program to fit the unique environment of our company. Moreover, our Compliance Program is dynamic and we regularly review and enhance our Compliance Program to meet our evolving compliance needs.

You may obtain a copy of the Compliance Program description by calling 1-855-245-2099.
II. Overview of Compliance Program
Leadership and Structure
Compliance Officer. Silvergate has appointed a Compliance Officer who is charged with developing, implementing, and monitoring the Compliance Program. We will ensure that the Compliance Officer has the ability to exercise independent judgment and effectuate change within the organization as needed. The Compliance Officer reports to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Silvergate and has direct access to the Silvergate Board of Directors.

Compliance Committee. Silvergate has established a Compliance Committee made up of Silvergate senior management. The role of the Compliance Committee is to advise and assist the Compliance Officer in the development, implementation, and ongoing oversight of the Compliance Program. The Compliance Committee meets on a regular basis to identify and manage areas of risk and areas of critical focus for the Compliance Program.

Written Standards
Silvergate has established policies and procedures, including our Code of Business Conduct, which articulates our fundamental principles and values and provides a framework for ethical conduct within our organization. The Code of Business Conduct establishes our expectation that management, employees, and agents of Silvergate act in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and Silvergate policies and procedures, as well as the highest standards of ethics.

Silvergate has established an annual spending limit for certain promotional activities directed toward healthcare professionals who prescribe or may influence prescribing in California. At the present time our annual spending limit is $1,000.00. Examples of items that fall within this spending limit are occasional modest meals in connection with informational presentations and educational items. This annual spending limit does not include payments to healthcare professionals for bona fide consulting or other services.

It is Silvergate’s policy to not provide any item of value to any healthcare professional with the intent of influencing that healthcare professional’s prescribing habits.

Education and Training
A critical element of our Compliance Program is the education and training of our employees on their legal and ethical obligations under applicable laws, rules, regulations, and company policies and procedures. Silvergate regularly communicates our policies and procedures to ensure a thorough understanding of the company’s expectations and regularly reviews and updates these training programs.

Internal Lines of Communication
Silvergate actively fosters dialogue between management and employees. Our goal is for all employees to know to whom to turn when seeking answers to questions or reporting possible violations of company policies or procedures, and understand that they can make such reports without fear of retaliation. To that end, we have adopted an open-door policy, as well as confidentiality and non-retaliation policies. We have a confidential, toll-free compliance hotline to which employees and persons outside of Silvergate may anonymously report any concerns or suspected violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, or Silvergate policies or procedures.

Auditing and Monitoring
Silvergate’s Compliance Program includes monitoring and auditing to evaluate adherence to Silvergate’s policies and procedures. We note that, in accordance with the OIG Guidance, the nature, extent, and frequency of our compliance monitoring and auditing may vary according to new regulatory requirements, changes in business practices, and other considerations.

Responding to Potential Violations
When Silvergate becomes aware of potential violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, or company policies and procedures, the company will promptly investigate such matters and make a determination as to whether the facts substantiate the existence of a violation. Silvergate will document the conduct of such investigations.

Disciplinary and Corrective Action
While each substantiated violation will be considered on a case-by-case basis, where appropriate we will utilize disciplinary action consistent with company policy to address violative conduct and to deter future violations. We will also work to determine the root cause of the violation and assess whether the violation is due to gaps in company policies or procedures and take appropriate corrective action designed to prevent future violations.
III. Declaration Clause for California, as of December 2016
Silvergate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. hereby declares that, to the best of our knowledge, information, and belief, and based upon our good-faith understanding of the statutory requirements, we have, as of December 2016, established a Comprehensive Compliance Program that is in material compliance with the requirements of California Health and Safety Code §§ 119400-119402. While Silvergate’s Comprehensive Compliance Program cannot completely eliminate the possibility that an individual employee will engage in improper conduct, our program is reasonably designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable laws, rules, and regulations, as well as our own internal policies and procedures.

Qbrelis: Package Insert and Label Information (Page 3 of 3)By Silvergate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Last revised: 29 August 2016
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mg per kg per day (about 56 or 9 times* the maximum recommended daily human dose, based on body weight and body surface area, respectively).  There was no evidence of carcinogenicity when lisinopril was administered for 92 weeks to (male and female) mice at doses up to 135 mg per kg per day (about 84 times* the maximum recommended daily human dose).  This dose was 6.8 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area in mice.




Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation.  It was also negative in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells.  Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an in vitro alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay.  In addition, lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an in vivo study in mouse bone marrow.
There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mg per kg per day of lisinopril.  This dose is 188 times and 30 times the maximum human dose when based on mg/kg and mg/m2 , respectively.
Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood brain barrier poorly.  Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues.  Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C lisinopril.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES  14.1 Hypertension  Two dose-response studies utilizing a once-daily regimen were conducted in 438 mild to moderate hypertensive patients not on a diuretic.  Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dosing.  An antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was seen with 5 mg of lisinopril in some patients.  However, in both studies blood pressure reduction occurred sooner and was greater in patients treated with 10, 20 or 80 mg of lisinopril than patients treated with 5 mg of lisinopril. 
In controlled clinical studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20-80 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-50 mg daily or atenolol 50‑200 mg daily; and in other studies of patients with moderate to severe hypertension, patients were treated with lisinopril 20-80 mg daily or metoprolol 100-200 mg daily.  Lisinopril demonstrated superior reductions of systolic and diastolic compared to hydrochlorothiazide in a population that was 75% Caucasian.  Lisinopril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.
Lisinopril had similar blood pressure reductions and adverse effects in younger and older (> 65 years) patients.  It was less effective in reducing blood pressure in Blacks than in Caucasians.
In hemodynamic studies of lisinopril in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate.  In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant.  Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not large.
In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well-tolerated and effective in reducing blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Pediatric Patients: In a clinical study involving 115 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who weighed < 50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5 or 20 mg of lisinopril once daily and patients who weighed ≥ 50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of lisinopril once daily.  At the end of 2 weeks, lisinopril lowered trough blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with antihypertensive efficacy demonstrated at doses > 1.25 mg (0.02 mg per kg).  This effect was confirmed in a randomized withdrawal phase, where the diastolic pressure rose by about 9 mmHg more in patients randomized to placebo than compared to patients who remained on the middle and high doses of lisinopril.  The dose-dependent antihypertensive effect of lisinopril was consistent across several demographic subgroups:  age, Tanner stage, gender, and race.  In this study, lisinopril was generally well-tolerated.
In the above pediatric study, lisinopril was given either as tablets or in a suspension for those children who were unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form.
14.2 Heart Failure  Two placebo controlled, 12-week clinical studies compared the addition of lisinopril up to 20 mg daily to digitalis and diuretics alone.  The combination of lisinopril, digitalis and diuretics reduced the following signs and symptoms of heart failure:  edema, rales, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and jugular venous distention.  In one of the studies, the combination of lisinopril, digitalis and diuretics reduced orthopnea, presence of third heart sound and the number of patients classified as NYHA Class III and IV; and improved exercise tolerance.  A large (over 3000 patients) survival study, the ATLAS Trial, comparing 2.5 and 35 mg of lisinopril in patients with systolic heart failure, showed that the higher dose of lisinopril had outcomes at least as favorable as the lower dose.
During baseline-controlled clinical trials, in patients with systolic heart failure receiving digitalis and diuretics, single doses of lisinopril resulted in decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure accompanied by an increase in cardiac output and no change in heart rate.
14.3 Acute Myocardial Infarction  The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvienza nell’Infarto Miocardico (GISSI-3) study was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, unblinded clinical trial conducted in 19,394 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) admitted to a coronary care unit.  It was designed to examine the effects of short-term (6 week) treatment with lisinopril, nitrates, their combination, or no therapy on short-term (6 week) mortality and on long-term death and markedly impaired cardiac function.  Hemodynamically-stable patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms were randomized, in a 2 x 2 factorial design, to six weeks of either 1) lisinopril alone (n=4841), 2) nitrates alone (n=4869), 3) lisinopril plus nitrates (n=4841), or 4) open control (n=4843).  All patients received routine therapies, including thrombolytics (72%), aspirin (84%), and a beta blocker (31%), as appropriate, normally utilized in acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients.
The protocol excluded patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg), severe heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2 mg per dL and/or proteinuria > 500 mg per 24 h).  Patients randomized to lisinopril received 5 mg within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, 5 mg after 24 hours, and then 10 mg daily thereafter.  Patients with systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg at baseline received 2.5 mg of lisinopril.  If hypotension occurred, the lisinopril dose was reduced or if severe hypotension occurred lisinopril was stopped [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
The primary outcomes of the trial were the overall mortality at 6 weeks and a combined end point at 6 months after the myocardial infarction, consisting of the number of patients who died, had late (day 4) clinical congestive heart failure, or had extensive left ventricular damage defined as ejection fraction ≤ 35% or an akinetic-dyskinetic [A-D] score ≥ 45%.  Patients receiving lisinopril (n=9646), alone or with nitrates, had an 11% lower risk of death (p = 0.04) compared to patients who did not receive lisinopril (n=9672) (6.4% vs. 7.2%, respectively) at six weeks.  Although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined end point at 6 months, the open nature of the assessment of heart failure, substantial loss to follow-up echocardiography, and substantial excess use of lisinopril between 6 weeks and 6 months in the group randomized to 6 weeks of lisinopril, preclude any conclusion about this end point.
Patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with lisinopril, had a higher (9.0% versus 3.7%) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4% versus 1.1%) in-hospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg per dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING QBRELIS (lisinopril), 1 mg/mL, is supplied as 150 mL of a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless aqueous oral solution with a sweet taste in a 150-mL high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a child‑resistant cap (NDC 52652-3001-1).  
Store at controlled room temperature 20°C‑25°C (68°F‑77°F) [see USP] in a tightly closed container. Protect from freezing and excessive heat.  
17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Pregnancy:  Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to QBRELIS during pregnancy.  Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant.  Tell patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. 
Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including QBRELIS.  Tell patients to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, difficulty swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.
Symptomatic Hypotension: Tell patients to report light-headedness especially during the first few days of therapy.  If actual syncope occurs, tell the patient to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.
Tell patients that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume.  Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; advise patients accordingly.
Hyperkalemia: Tell patients to consult their physician prior to using salt substitutes containing potassium.
Hypoglycemia: Tell diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin starting an ACE inhibitor to monitor for hypoglycemia closely, especially during the first month of combined use [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
Leukopenia/Neutropenia: Tell patients to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which may be a sign of leukopenia/neutropenia.
