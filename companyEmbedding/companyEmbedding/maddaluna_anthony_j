NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that Anthony J. Maddaluna, 
      Executive Vice President and President of Pfizer Global Supply will 
      retire from the company after more than 41 years with Pfizer.
    


      “I have had the privilege of working with Tony during much of his 
      career, and he has been a valuable partner to me,” said Ian Read, 
      chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer. “Tony has continually 
      demonstrated a steadfast commitment to Pfizer and our mission. His focus 
      on quality, compliance and customer service has established Pfizer 
      Global Supply as an industry leading supply organization that is highly 
      respected by internal and external stakeholders. I know I join all 
      Pfizer colleagues in thanking Tony for his tireless efforts and wishing 
      him and his family all the best as he embarks on the next stage of his 
      life.”
    

      Mr. Maddaluna began his career at Pfizer in 1975, and throughout his 
      career with the company has held several positions of increasing 
      responsibility prior to being named President of Pfizer Global Supply in 
      2011.
    

      “I have thoroughly enjoyed my career at Pfizer and being part of the 
      company’s executive leadership team,” said Tony Maddaluna. “Based on 
      more than four decades at Pfizer, I am truly proud of our dedicated 
      colleagues who have discovered, developed and delivered the high 
      quality vaccines and medicines that combat the world’s most pressing 
      healthcare challenges today.”
    

      Kirsten Lund-Jurgensen will succeed Mr. Maddaluna and has been named 
      Executive Vice President and President of Pfizer Global Supply, 
      effective December 30, 2016. She is currently Vice President, Innovative 
      Health Product Portfolio Management and Consumer Operations. Ms. 
      Lund-Jurgensen will report directly to Mr. Read and join Pfizer’s 
      Executive Leadership team.
    

      “Kirsten has already been playing a leadership role in Pfizer Global 
      Supply, and her wealth of knowledge, extensive operational experience 
      and solid track record of delivering results make her an excellent 
      choice for the leader of our supply organization,” stated Read.
    

      Ms. Lund-Jurgensen joined the Company in 1999 as Vice President, Global 
      Supply Chain Management, Pharmaceuticals. Prior to Pfizer, she was with 
      SmithKline Beecham in Germany, Australia, and the United States, working 
      in several operational roles. Ms. Lund-Jurgensen is a pharmacist and 
      holds a Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Biology from Freiburg University in 
      Germany.

MaddalunaExecutive Vice President, Pfizer Inc.President, Pfizer Global SupplyCreating Value Through VisionHow does “Vision” translate to “Value”? Ever since his first role as a manufacturing site leader at Pfizer, Anthony Maddaluna’s goal has been to create a Vision-driven organization. His work at that site focused on cultural change through a common set of values in the days before this had become a widespread practice. This became the foundation for the Vision (Purpose – Mission – Mission Elements – Values) which guides and drives the current day Pfizer Global Supply (PGS) organization that comprises 20,000 colleagues and 55 internal manufacturing sites and 200 external supply partners worldwide.“The PGS’ Fundamental Value Proposition is based on three key components,” Tony explains. “Quality and Compliance, Supply Reliability and Cost/Cash/Value. While we strive to balance all three of these components, we will not compromise on Quality and Compliance.”Since becoming President of PGS in January 2011, Tony has focused on ensuring PGS is a critical element of Pfizer’s success by adding value beyond just the reliable supply of products. In fact, the customer interface has end-to-end product portfolio managers who work closely with their commercial partners to maximize value. They are also participants in the company’s business development efforts and are actively involved in every strategic deal that Pfizer does.“Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with my colleagues on the commercial side of the business, learning what their needs are and how the Pfizer Global Supply organization can best meet them,” he explains. “Our commercial colleagues know that they can count on PGS to assist them in creating profitable brands that meet the needs of patients and doctors, and deliver a fair return on investment to Pfizer shareholders.”“My personal mission in life is to ‘persistently make a profound positive difference,’” Tony explains. “Right now, my executive team and I are working on positioning the Pfizer Global Supply organization to be ready to take on the challenges of the future, so that our commercial partners around the globe will be confident that PGS will continue to provide them with the high level of service they have come to expect of us.”Facebook Twitter Linkedin Linkedin0Shares PM360 StaffClick here to email authorNEXT STORYELITE Transformational Leader David Nakamura of NatrelPREV STORYELITE Transformational Leader Meghan Lopresto of Boehringer IngelheimExperts on CallAmy GroggRare Disease & Orphan Drug Commercialization Rick RatliffEMR/EHR ConnectionsBud BilanichSuccess CoachErik DaltonHCP EngagementRichard MeyerDTC MarketingJohn Weinman, PhDHealth PsychologyDon FeilerBrand EngagementBrenda SnowAuthentic Patient VoiceJeffrey D.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
