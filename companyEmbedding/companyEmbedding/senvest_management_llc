Senvest Capital




About Us
 

				Headquartered in Montreal, Canada, Senvest Capital operates as a holding company with interests in investment management and direct investing in public securities and private investments. Senvest, publicly traded since 1972 and presently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, was originally founded as the exclusive Canadian licensee and distributor for US-based Sensormatic Electronics, a pioneer in anti-theft-at-retail electronic security systems.
				
				Among other businesses acquired and operated by the company, Senvest Capital also spearheaded the development and operated one of Canada’s first cable pay-TV channels, First Choice, which it sold to a leading Canadian company Astral Media.
				
				Over the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, Senvest divested its operating units and drawing on its knowledge as an operator of businesses, the company focused on investing its capital in public securities and private investments.
