Loan origination software system for processing mortgage loans over a distributed network



Patent number:  9313209
                                            

Abstract:  A loan origination and processing system is described. The system can reside on a server computer that is coupled to a data store storing data related to a borrower. The server computer is further coupled to a brokerage network that comprises a loan officer client, a loan processor client, and a broker manager client. Each brokerage client computer executes a unique interface to the loan origination and processing system.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Enterprise security management system using hierarchical organization and multiple ownership structure



Patent number:  9143514
                                            

Abstract:  A hierarchical security model for networked computer users is described. Files and resources are controlled or created by users within the network. Each user within the network has an account that is managed by a network administrator. The account specifies the user identifier and password. Users are grouped into organizations depending upon function or other organizational parameter. The groups within the network are organized hierarchically in terms of access and control privileges. Users within a higher level group may exercise access and control privileges over files or resources owned by users in a lower level group. The account for each user further specifies the group that the owner belongs to and an identifier for any higher level groups that have access privileges over the user's group. All users within a group inherit the rights and restrictions of the group.

Enterprise Security Management System Using Hierarchical Organization and Multiple Ownership Structure



Publication number:  20120158787
                                            

Abstract:  A hierarchical security model for networked computer users is described. Files and resources are controlled or created by users within the network. Each user within the network has an account that is managed by a network administrator. The account specifies the user identifier and password. Users are grouped into organizations depending upon function or other organizational parameter. The groups within the network are organized hierarchically in terms of access and control privileges. Users within a higher level group may exercise access and control privileges over files or resources owned by users in a lower level group. The account for each user further specifies the group that the owner belongs to and an identifier for any higher level groups that have access privileges over the user's group. All users within a group inherit the rights and restrictions of the group.

Loan origination system interface for online loan application processing



Patent number:  7472089
                                            

Abstract:  A loan origination system interface module for processing loan applications from a user through a lender web site is described. The loan originator accesses a lender web site to perform loan processing procedures. The module is included on the lender's web page through a standard object reference in HTML specification. The module contains information unique to that lender, and the lender's identification number as well as desired data format. Once the loan originator decides to transfer a loan application or supplemental data to the lender, the module examines the loan origination software pipeline and presents a selection of loan products to the user. Once the user makes a selection, the module extracts loan information stored in the loan origination software by conducting a search for each required data field, relates that data to the specific field in the vendor application format, and packages the data in a format acceptable to the lender.

Patent number:  7444302
                                            

Abstract:  A processing and submission client/server system transmits relevant loan information from a borrower to one or more lender computer systems through pre-defined file templates, which are utilized during loan origination. An automatic data flow process from the origination screen populates the relevant fields in any other related loan forms and word processing documents. Different forms are supported for different types of loans. The loan originator computer system includes a loan origination software program integrated with a web-browser based interface system. The interface system couples the loan origination software program to one or more partner computers. The partners comprise loan underwriters, lenders, and settlement service vendors. The interface system provides dynamic formatting and data transmission for different connections depending on the transaction type and target partner.

Universal computing paradigm with single-code base utilizing a flexible distributed computing architecture



Publication number:  20060101023
                                            

Abstract:  An application program for use in a hybrid computing environment comprising standalone, client-server, or Internet use is described. The application is written in a single code base and installed on a client computer that is configured for use as either a standalone or networked computer. Server side components of the application program are installed on a server computer configured to be coupled to client computers over a local or wide area network or over the Internet. Data and file resources utilized by the application program are installed locally on the client computer or on the server computer, or on a device remotely coupled to the network coupling the client and server computers. The application program is installed on the client computer for use as a standalone, client-server, or Internet application, or any combination thereof. At runtime, the user selects the mode of use in which the application program is to be executed.

Automatic web-based client-server application program update system



Publication number:  20060069753
                                            

Abstract:  An automated software update method for distributed client/server computers is described. A server process is executed a program on either a standalone computer or a server computer in a distributed client/server network environment. The program updates are either programmed into the server process directly or downloaded to the server in the background. When there is an update to the program, the server forces all client computers executing client-side processes of the server process to shutdown the client process. Alternatively, the server process notifies all clients that an update or maintenance procedure needs to be performed and schedules a disconnect request for all clients. When all clients are disconnected, the server downloads the program updates and performs an automated process to update itself. After the server program is updated, the server allows reconnection of the client computers.

Lett., 2015, 17 (2), pp 298–301DOI: 10.1021/ol5034018Publication Date (Web): December 26, 2014Copyright © 2014 American Chemical Society*E-mail: wanglimin@ecust.edu.cn., *E-mail: jinbohu@sioc.ac.cn.  NoteIn Table 1, the initiators in entries 1 and 2 were corrected on December 29, 2014; this was due to a production error.AbstractA new method for the generation of trifluoromethylcopper (“CuCF3”) species from readily available phenyl trifluoromethyl sulfoxide has been developed. The “CuCF3” reagent can be applied in efficient trifluoromethylations of aryl iodides and activated aryl bromides in the absence of additional ligands. Furthermore, the “CuCF3” species can also undergo oxidative cross-coupling with terminal alkynes and arylboronic acids.

Description:

CROSS-REFERENCEThis application is a continuation of, and claims priority to, pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/273,325, filed on Nov. 18, 2008, entitled “Loan Origination System Interface for Online Loan Application Processing”, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/222,637, filed on Aug. 15, 2002, entitled “Loan Origination System Interface for Online Loan Application Processing”, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,472,089; and is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 10/172,844, filed on Jun. 14, 2002, entitled “Online System for Fulfilling Loan Applications from Loan Originators”. The application herein claims the benefit of priority of all the above listed patent applications and hereby incorporates by reference in their entirety the said patent applications.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to computer networks, and more specifically, to a web-based interface between lenders and loan brokers using loan origination system software.BACKGROUNDThe World Wide Web (“web”) has evolved from first generation web systems that simply provided information to client computers over the Internet through a web browser program, to second generation systems using application servers that provide dynamic, personalized information and powerful back-end transaction processing.A great number of commercial applications have become adapted to on-line systems, thus establishing a base of many different types of electronic commerce or “e-commerce” transactions. One traditional commercial transaction type that has become adapted to online implementations is that of financial loans. The loan application process is often a complicated and confusing process for average borrowers. There are a great many different types of loans available depending upon the type of loan required, such as personal loans, home mortgages, business lines of credit, and so on. There are also many different variables or negotiable terms associated with each loan, such as interest rate, loan period, and the like. In most cases, a detailed profile of the borrower is required because factors such as age, employment, financial history, credit rating and so on, can have a great deal of impact on the cost or even qualification for a loan. Moreover, loans are available from many different sources, such as traditional banks to private and commercial money lenders.Thus, the process of applying for and obtaining a loan can be complicated and time consuming because of the great number of variables regarding the loan, the lender, and the borrower, as well as the number of parties involved in the loan process. Because of the distributed information-intensive nature of the loan industry, a class of loan brokers, often referred to as “loan originators” or “loan origination services” has emerged to aid borrowers in finding and obtaining the proper loan. The advent of loan originators has served to provide an important interface between borrowers and the various lenders who might have an appropriate loan product.The widespread use of the Internet has generally led loan originators to recognize and accept the Internet and computerized processes as viable and promising vehicles with which to conduct business. Traditional loan processing involves a great deal of customer support, data input, and expedited mailing and delivery of physical documents. These factors present areas of great cost and potential problems in the loan application, processing, and delivery transaction. Although most present loan originators have implemented software systems to automate their processes, typical loan origination systems (LOS) do not provide a comprehensive interface between borrowers and lenders. Furthermore, most present loan origination systems do not provide comprehensive form and document completion process that truly automates the loan application process and minimizes the errors associated with individually completing all of the separate forms required in a typical loan transaction. A further disadvantage associated with present on-line implemented loan application systems is the typically complex loan file export and manual form population process that is required on the lender and loan origination vendor web sites.Although comprehensive software systems have been developed to integrate lender, broker, and third party vendors within Internet-based loan application and fulfillment networks, such systems often involve extensive interfacing or customization of each party's computer networks. For example, present systems typically require that each individual lenders or third parties install application interfaces or custom components that render their network portal computers compatible with certain specific broker computer systems or commercially available loan origination system program. Such a requirement is often burdensome to the lenders and third parties. These systems also present potential sources of problems, and can often require redundant storage or transmission of existing data.What is needed, therefore, is a loan processing system that provides an efficient interface between lender computers and broker computers that accesses data and resources already available on the broker computer system.What is further needed is a web-based interface that transfers data from a lender computer network to a broker network without requiring the lender to install extensive programs or program interfaces.SUMMARYA web-based loan origination system interface for on-line lenders and loan brokers is described. Data comprising borrower and loan product information is stored in data storage accessible to a loan origination system program. The loan origination system and a web browser process are executed by a loan broker computer. A lender computer coupled to the loan broker computer executes a web server process and a module that serves to access data from the loan origination system program. The loan originator accesses the lender web site to perform loan processing procedures. The module is included on the lender's web site as a reference link. The module contains information unique to the lender, such as the lender's identification number and the lender's desired data format. Once the loan originator decides to transfer a loan application or supplemental data to the lender, the module examines the loan origination software pipeline and presents it to the loan originator. When the loan originator selects an action to be performed, the module extracts loan information stored in the loan origination software by conducting a search for each required data field, relates that data to the specific field in the vendor application format, and packages the data in a format acceptable to the lender. The module then finds the appropriate route to deliver the loan data to the lender, either directly through a standard Internet secure communication protocol, or indirectly through a separate server computer. The loan originator can then continue the transaction on the lender's web site in an uninterrupted work flow. Loan processing occurs on the lender's web site, and the interaction of the web site and loan origination software is handled by the module.In one embodiment, the loan origination system interface is implemented in a computer network that comprises a processing and submission system that receives relevant loan information from a borrower and enters this information into file templates, which are utilized during loan origination. An automatic data flow process accessible through an origination screen populates the relevant fields in all of the other loan forms and word processing documents. Forms are supported for several different loan types, such as conventional mortgages, federal housing authority loans, veterans administration loans, and other similar types of personal and business loans. The automatic data flow eliminates the need to re-enter the same information in each form, and it also automatically calculates relevant field data, such as percentage rate, maximum loan, cash to or from borrower, amortization schedules, and the like. Once information is entered into each data field, e.g., name and address, of the file template during the loan origination process, the information is saved in a database wherein each data field is associated with the particular information entered. When a particular loan form is activated, the automatic data flow program conducts a search for each data field. Alternatively, each loan form can be modified to insert embedded codes, so that the computer program can more easily identify the location of a data field and enter the associated information.Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows below.DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGSThe present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate similar elements, and in which:FIG. 1A illustrates a network that implements a web-based loan origination system interface between a loan broker web client and a lender web server, according to one embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 1B illustrates the interface between the loan processing software system and one or more loan origination systems, according to one embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 2A is a flowchart that illustrates the general steps of processing a loan application through the system illustrated in FIG. 1A, according to a method of the present invention;FIG. 2B is a flowchart that illustrates the transaction steps between the web server process of the lender computer, and the web client process of the broker computer for the system illustrated in FIG. 1A, according to a method of the present invention;FIG. 3A is an exemplary web page for a lender web site displaying a loan pipeline, according to one embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 3B is an exemplary web page for a loan submission through a lender computer, according to one embodiment of the present invention;FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of providing an interface between loan origination servers and lender computers, according to a method of the present invention;FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating the steps of providing an interface between loan origination servers and lender computers according to the steps illustrated in FIG. 4; andFIG. 6 illustrates a network that implements a loan processing software system, and that includes both a web-based loan origination system interface and a server-implemented loan application system, according to one embodiment of the present invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONA web-based loan origination system interface for brokers and lenders computer networks is described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate explanation. The description of preferred embodiments is not intended to limit the scope of the claims appended hereto.Aspects of the present invention may be implemented on one or more computers executing software instructions. According to one embodiment of the present invention, server and client computer systems transmit and receive data over a computer network or a fiber or copper-based telecommunications network. The steps of accessing, downloading, and manipulating the data, as well as other aspects of the present invention are implemented by central processing units (CPU) in the server and client computers executing sequences of instructions stored in a memory. The memory may be a random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a persistent store, such as a mass storage device, or any combination of these devices. Execution of the sequences of instructions causes the CPU to perform steps according to embodiments of the present invention.The instructions may be loaded into the memory of the server or client computers from a storage device or from one or more other computer systems over a network connection. For example, a client computer may transmit a sequence of instructions to the server computer in response to a message transmitted to the client over a network by the server. As the server receives the instructions over the network connection, it stores the instructions in memory. The server may store the instructions for later execution, or it may execute the instructions as they arrive over the network connection. In some cases, the downloaded instructions may be directly supported by the CPU. In other cases, the instructions may not be directly executable by the CPU, and may instead be executed by an interpreter that interprets the instructions. In other embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions to implement the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the server or client computers. In some instances, the client and server functionality may be implemented on a single computer platform.Aspects of the present invention can be used in a distributed electronic commerce application that includes a client/server network system that links one or more server computers to one or more client computers, as well as server computers to other server computers and client computers to other client computers. The client and server computers may be implemented as desktop personal computers, workstation computers, mobile computers, portable computing devices, personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, or any other similar type of computing device.In the loan application process, a broker matches a borrower (customer) with the loan package that best suits their need. Unlike the retail loan market, in which the borrower directly inquires about loans available from a bank or commercial lender, the loan broker utilizes the wholesale loan market. In terms of a general process, the broker obtains data from the borrower and then shops for loans from the available sources in the wholesale loan market. Wholesale lenders typically work only with brokers, and take completed loan packages and underwrite them. The brokers are typically offered discounted pricing in return for the processing work performed by the broker.In a network embodiment of the present invention, a loan broker computer is configured to access computers operated by third parties (typically in the wholesale loan market), such as lenders, loan underwriters, settlement service vendors, and other similar loan fulfillment parties through a web-based interface that is integrated with a loan origination software program. The loan broker provides an on-line interface between borrowers, and those companies that will ultimately perform the loan services and provide the requested funds. During the course of the loan application process, various items of information are transmitted among the parties, including borrower information and loan application data. This information is typically maintained in databases stored in the broker computer, or on the third party computers. Different entities may be responsible for different aspects of the transaction from the lender's side. For example, one company may be involved in the processing of a loan application, while another is involved with providing the loan itself, while yet another may be involved with the billing and collection of repayment from the borrower.The network implementation facilitates the delivery (transmission) and tracking of data and allows for the completion of electronic commerce transactions. Several different network topologies may be implemented through the use of a loan processing network system according to embodiments of the present invention. In general, the network system couples one or more lenders (banks, financial institutions, credit agencies, and so on) to the loan brokers who act on behalf of potential borrowers. The loan brokers help borrowers to find and obtain loans by obtaining personal data from the borrower, searching for compatible loans from the various lenders, presenting loan selections to the borrower, and performing certain validation or screening tasks, such as pre-qualification of the borrower. The loan brokers also directly interface with the parties that will fulfill the loan or provide settlement services, such as lenders, loan underwriters, and settlement service vendors.A broker typically keeps track of pending loans and customers through one or more pipelines. A pipeline generally refers to a list of all loans or loan applications and/or borrowers that are committed and being processed by the broker. A separate pipeline, often referred to as a “pre-qualification pipeline” can be used to list prospective loans and/or borrowers who are not yet committed to a particular loan.For purposes of the present discussion, a lender can be any kind of wholesale lender, retail lender, correspondent lender, or other type of financial institution that lends money. A loan originator is any person or entity that helps to procure a loan from a lender on behalf of a borrower, and can include loan brokers, loan officers, loan processors, correspondent brokers, small banks that provide brokerage services, and any other similar type of loan procurement company or personnel. As used herein, the term “loan broker” is used to represent any such type of loan originator.Loan brokers typically execute Loan Origination Software (LOS) programs to manage the origination tasks in the loan application process for a borrower. In one embodiment of the present invention, a processing and submission system is embedded in the broker computer system and is closely coupled to or integrated within the loan origination system program on the broker desktop. This integration serves to streamline the loan submission process and provides seamless connectivity to lenders and settlement service vendors over the network. The processing and submission system provides a direct interface to the loan origination system programs and allows efficient management and transmission of file data present in the broker loan origination software to the lender and vendor computer systems. The processing and submission system thus provides a centralized and comprehensive system for compiling the loan and borrower information, populating the loan documents with the relevant data, and submitting the completed documents to the appropriate lender and other third parties for review. This allows the broker to capture the borrower data once and publish this data to multiple lenders without having to repeatedly enter the borrower data for each loan application.With the advent of the Internet, there has arisen a prevalence of web-based client/server networks involving the transmission of data through web pages served on server web sites accessed by client computers. Embodiments of the present invention include web-based interfaces and data transmission routines that facilitate the processing of loan applications between loan originators (brokers) and lenders over the Internet. FIG. 1A illustrates a network that implements a web-based loan origination system interface between a loan broker web client and a lender web server, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In system 100, a loan broker computer 102 executes a web browser program (such as Microsoft Explorer™ or Netscape Navigator™) 106 that accesses a web page served by a web server process 112 executed on a lender computer 104. The loan broker computer 102 also executes one or more loan origination system (LOS) programs 108. The loan origination software program 108 utilized by the loan broker can be a proprietary system or a commercially available system. Examples of present commercially available loan origination system programs include Genesis™, Contour™, Calyx Point™, and Byte™ among other similar LOS programs.As shown in FIG. 1A, the lender 104 maintains a web site through web server process 112 that provides access for brokers and other loan originators to the various resources and products available from the lender. This allows loan originators and other users to access the lenders web site through a standard web browser interface. A loan origination system program interface, referred to herein as the “clickloan module” 114 is integrated into the lender web site through a web-based plug-in interface to web server process 112. The clickloan module 114 interfaces with the loan origination system software that is executed by the loan broker computer 102. The clickloan module 114 automatically identifies and transfers a loan application or its required information directly from the loan origination system program 108 to the lender web site with a minimum number of user operations, e.g., typewritten commands or mouse clicks. This process eliminates the need for the user (broker) to transfer the loan application and the relevant data directly to the lender computer. Data comprising borrower and/or loan information is stored in a data storage 110 that is closely or remotely coupled to the loan broker computer 102 through the loan origination system program 108.The clickloan module 114 stores and processes information regarding the lender loan products, as well as account and network identification. Access to the clickloan module is typically provided by means of a hypertext link, or similar command mechanism, displayed on the lender's web page. Upon execution, the clickloan module provides the relevant lender information, and accesses the loan application and borrower data from the data source 110 through the loan origination system 108. This information is then formatted and displayed to the broker through the lender web page and displayed using the web browser 106 on the broker computer 102. In this manner, data that is resident on the broker computer is used to build the information requested by the user. This mechanism eliminates typical complex loan file export functions and form population operations involved in most present on-line loan application systems.Although not shown in FIG. 1A, either or both of the loan broker computer 102 and the lender computer 104 can be directly or indirectly coupled to computers operated by other relevant parties, such as loan underwriters, settlement service vendors, or other third parties that perform the function of fulfilling and settling the loan application. A separate server computer 116 may be used to download one or more program components to the loan broker computer 102 for use by the loan origination system program 108 and/or the clickloan module 114.FIG. 1B illustrates the interface between the embedded clickloan module and one or more loan origination systems, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The clickloan module 123 is closely coupled to the lender web site 122. The clickloan module 123 includes a loan selection sub-module 124 and a loan processing sub-module 126. One or more loan origination system programs are coupled to the loan selection sub-module 124. The loan selection sub-module accesses and displays a list of loan applications (borrower files) that the loan broker may want to submit to a specific function on the lender web site. Once the appropriate loan application file has been selected, the loan processing sub-module 126 performs the appropriate calculations and processing to extract, validate, format, and submit the loan application to the lender web site.The loan origination system programs illustrated in FIG. 1B include Genesis 125, Contour 127, and Calyx 129, although other loan origination system programs are also possible. The clickloan module 123 interfaces to each LOS programs through direct data structure access, an application programming interface (API), or similar type of program adapter. Furthermore, each LOS program contains or is coupled to a respective data source 135, 137, and 139. Upon initiation by the broker, the clickloan API interfaces within the respective LOS programs operate to transfer data from the LOS program to the clickloan module 123 resident on the lender web site 122. This prevents the need for the broker to enter this information directly into the lender web site 122. In this manner, the relevant loan application is “pulled” from the LOS program to the lender web site. The integration within the lender's web site eliminates the need for the lender to implement or otherwise closely couple itself to the loan origination system server (e.g., loan broker computer 102). For the embodiment in which the clickloan module is configured to utilize an existing API, the pipeline information can be displayed in a format consistent with the LOS program. This allows the module to preserve the “look and feel” of the original LOS program.In one embodiment of the present invention, the loan origination system programs of system 150 can be included within the loan broker desktop environment of the loan originator computer, or they may comprise remotely executed programs executed on the broker computer or a separate networked computer, e.g., server 116 of system 100. In general, the loan origination programs serve a loan origination screen to be accessed by borrowers over a network, and typically through a web browser interface. File templates, which serve as blank loan application forms, are then loaded and displayed to the borrower. These are loaded from a database of file templates that are stored either locally on the loan originator computer or on a remote storage device, such as data storage 110. Various file templates can be defined for different loan types, such as conventional loans, FHA loans, VA loans, and so on. After the borrower enters the relevant personal and loan information required by the file template and initial loan application form, a processing client executes an automatic data flow process to populate the same information in all of the corresponding fields in all other documents and forms processed by the system that are related to the loan application. This includes other related bank and government forms, as well as word processing documents, spreadsheets, and any other documents with fields that are linked to the original form or other defined that same as the original fields. If necessary, the processing client also automatically calculates relevant field data in any of the fields of the forms that require derivation or calculation. These can include fields that calculate interest rates for given borrower profile and loan period and amount, as well as cash flow or amortization schedules, among other calculations. Once the entry field information has been populated for all of the forms and documents, and the relevant calculations have been performed, the loan application documents are submitted by the loan originator to the appropriate lenders either directly or indirectly through the processing and submission server. Depending upon the interface between the lenders to the network and/or the processing and submission server, the loan information is input into the lender computer systems as seamlessly as possible. For example, if the interface between a lender and the network is web-based, such as the Freddie Mac Loan Prospector system, the information is populated directly into the lender web forms. This automated input and distribution system eliminates the need to fill out individual disparate loan application forms, and transmit the forms to the various broker and lender sites.As illustrated in system 100 of FIG. 1A, the interface system between the lender computer 104 and the broker computer 102, referred to as the “clickloan” interface, serves to eliminate the complex loan file export function and manual form-filing process currently required on lending and vendor web sites. The clickloan interface is integrated into the lender's web site through clickloan module 114. This interface allows a borrower accessing the lender's web site through a normal web browser to identify and transfer a loan application and associated data to the lender computer in an efficient manner. For example, through a web browser, such an operation can be typically accomplished by the user in two mouse clicks.FIG. 2A is a flowchart that illustrates the general steps of processing a loan application through the system illustrated in FIG. 1A, according to a method of the present invention. As a preliminary step, it is assumed that the borrower and loan application data is loaded into the loan origination system program 108 that is executed by the loan broker computer 102, step 220. The loan broker accesses the web site of the particular lender that he is interested in, step 222. Typically, the lender web site provides a list or menu of operations that the broker can perform, such as obtaining a loan quote, pre-qualifying a borrower, and so on. In step 224, the broker selects the action to be performed. For operations that require loan and/or borrower data, the clickloan module 114 instantiates within the browser to access the LOS pipeline, step 226. The clickloan module then creates an instantiation of the loan application object on the desktop of the loan broker computer 102 through the broker web browser 106. In this step, 226, the clickloan component checks the software configuration of the broker computer 102 and determines the location of the pipeline in the memory, typically the hard disk location, of the broker computer, and displays the pipeline through the web page displayed by web browser 106. This process is referred to as an “instantiation” of the clickloan component.After the object is created, the clickloan module automatically creates an LOS pipeline listing the various borrowers and loan applications that are active within the loan origination system, step 228. In general, the displayed pipeline lists all of the pending loan applications for all of the borrowers being processed by the LOS program 108 in the broker computer 102. Alternatively, filters or pre-processing flags in which the LOS is actively running for only a particular borrower is being processed can allow the pipeline to display pending loan applications for only a particular borrower. Other filters can be defined to allow display of pipelines for specific applications, such as time-based, status-based, or similar criteria. From the pipeline, the broker may select a particular borrower file, step 230. The clickloan module transmits the borrower data from the loan origination system to the broker desktop through the web interface, step 232. Once the data is populated within the instantiation of the application object that is created on the broker desktop, the selected operation is executed, step 234.As is illustrated in FIG. 2A, the clickloan module 114 essentially creates an executable instance of the application on the broker computer using data from the loan origination system program. The creation of the object instance on the broker computer is implemented, in one embodiment, through the web-based client/server relationship between the broker computer 102 and the lender computer 104. FIG. 2B is a flowchart that illustrates the transaction steps between the web server process of the lender computer, and the web client process of the broker computer for the system illustrated in FIG. 1A, according to a method of the present invention. Upon access of the lender web page by the broker, the lender web server 112 transmits the HTML data comprising the web page to the broker computer 102, step 240. The web browser process 106 on the broker computer 102 then displays the lender web page, step 242. The broker web browser 106 creates an instantiation of the clickloan object for the loan application, step 244. The data comprising the object can be either stored locally on the broker computer 102, or can be remotely downloaded from a separate server computer 116. Once the pipeline is created and displayed, the broker selects the borrower file, step 246. The clickloan object accesses the loan broker desktop to retrieve, format, and submit the LOS data to the broker computer, step 248.As discussed above, the lender web site is typically accessed by a loan broker or originator using a web browser program. FIG. 3B is an exemplary web page for a lender Indy Mac™ Bank, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The web page 300 includes a display area 302, which allows the user to specify one or more actions to perform. These include submitting an application for a new loan, locking a rate for a new loan, viewing market conditions, and other such actions. Also provided is a display area 304 that provides access to loan origination system programs that allows for the import of data from various LOS programs that might be available. The lender web page 300 provides a simple and familiar interface for the user to the LOS programs linked to the lender. As loan applications are processed through the lender web site, information and relevant data are pulled from the LOS programs into the web site for processing and display to the user. The main display area 305 displays data entry points and information related to the action that is selected by the broker.Once in the lender web site, the broker can select a particular action, create a new loan application, or access an existing loan application. For operations involving existing applications, the broker specifies data to be imported from the appropriate LOS program using option buttons 304. Upon importation of the LOS data, the clickloan module automatically creates and displays a pipeline of present loan applications. Such a pipeline is illustrated in FIG. 3A in the main display area 310. In one embodiment of the present invention, the pipeline is displayed in a spreadsheet format listing the borrower name, loan application status, loan officer/processor, and property (in the mortgage). Each entry in the spreadsheet pipeline is a hypertext link that provides access to further loan application data pertaining to the borrower. Thus, if the broker clicks on a borrower's name, an object comprising the loan application is created, and the relevant data is downloaded from the LOS program.FIG. 3B illustrates the loan application page 305 for a particular borrower. The display area 305 displays certain items of information, such as loan number, borrower data, loan information, and so on. The data for each of the fields is automatically transferred from the LOS program by the clickloan module. FIG. 3B illustrates an instance of the loan application object that allows the broker to submit the loan for the borrower. Once the data is imported, a simple click operation is all that is required to submit the loan for approval. In this case, the broker did not need to enter any additional data, as the clickloan module caused the data to be automatically transmitted from the LOS program.The clickloan interface is configured to be used for any function that requires data transfer including pre-qualification, submission, rate locking, settlement service ordering, or any similar type of operation. It can pass any data contained in the loan broker computer 102, regardless of the type of document format (e.g., 1003, 1008, GFE, or other type of form). In one embodiment, the clickloan module and interface is integrated into the lender's web site as a self-contained component and provides access to the loan application management program, e.g., Genesis, Contour, and Calyx Point data being run on the loan originator computer.In one embodiment, the clickloan interface is hosted by a dedicated process within the processing and submission server. For this embodiment, the clickloan module 114 can be implemented as Microsoft Active X module that is downloaded one time to the lender web site hosting computer. There is a separate component for each LOS hosted on the loan broker computer 102. The clickloan module 114 displays the loan originator pipeline (loan selection panel) by reading the internal index and borrower file or database structure of each loan originator, and packages them according to the lender's data and format requirements. A secure Internet protocol HTTPS is then used by the clickloan module to communicate with the lender's secure web server 112 as well as the broker computer 102.The integration of the clickloan module on a lender site is accomplished through a basic three-step process. First the module determines the data content and format utilized by the lender. References to the clickloan module components are then incorporated on the lender's HTML pages. Data is then received in a standard HTTPS Post request. Two-way communication between the lender web site and the loan originator is achieved via the web interface. Lender 104 can post data back to the broker computer 102.In one embodiment of the present invention, the clickloan module 114 is configured to support various formats, including FNMA 3.0 and XML, or simply a list of name value pairs. On-demand installation and automatic update of the ActiveX components is also provided. The dynamic server processing architecture illustrated in FIG. 1A allows the client side (clickloan module) process to diversify traffic to the broker computer, with all data mapping to the supported loan origination system performed locally. The web page displayed to the broker can be configured to include a series of simple HTML links that provide access to the lender web pages.FIG. 4 is a flow diagram that illustrates an implementation of the clickloan interface, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In step 402 the loan originator (broker) accesses the lender web site 130 through a resident web browser program. The broker selects an action that requires loan originator data, step 404. This is typically accomplished by the broker clicking on a loan application selection button on the loan origination system web site, or accessing his or her account information through the loan origination system site. If the action is an “on-demand” action, as determined in step 405, an on-demand installation and auto-update of the clickloan component 132 on the lender's site is performed, step 406. The clickloan component 408 then presents a pipeline to the broker, step 410. The loan product data comprising the pipeline is provided by the loan origination system programs 118, as shown in step 418.Data to be used in the loan application process, such as data relating to the borrower, is provided by the processing and submission server, step 416. In step 412, the data is prepared and transmitted by the loan originator to the lender web server. This data can either be sent directly to the lender web server, as shown in step 414, or it can be transmitted indirectly through a clickloan server process within the processing and submission server 102, as shown in step 416.FIG. 5 represents a more detailed flowchart illustrating the steps of providing an interface between loan origination servers and lender computers according to the steps illustrated in FIG. 4. In step 502, a lender web page is referenced to a clickloan object processed by the clickloan module 118. This object is compiled to form a loan origination service import page 503. In step 504, the browser checks if the object is local and current. If not, the browser downloads the late version of the object from the clickloan server process within the processing and submission server 102, and stores the object on the LOS client, step 505. The process then proceeds from step 506 in which the web browser preserves a local pipeline and emulates the loan origination system to read the local configuration. In step 507, the borrower selects the browser file corresponding to the loan application.In step 508 the clickloan module 118 locates the loan application file, extracts the user input and calculated data, and formats the data appropriately for upload to the lender. This step may be facilitated by the processing and submission server, such as for data entry, entry field calculations, formatting operations, and/or file transmission to the lender. Once the data is formatted, the destination address, typically a web page uniform resource locator (URL) address, of the lender web site is determined, step 510. The transaction is then logged to the processing and submission server 102, step 511. Data from the same application and submission session is also transferred from the desktop to the processing and submission server, step 512.As illustrated in FIG. 1B, the clickloan module is integrated within or otherwise closely coupled to the lender (or vendor) web site. A user accessing the lender web site is provided a gateway to the loan origination software program through the clickloan interface.The first time a user (typically a loan originator) visits the wholesale lender's or vendor's web site, he or she indicates the installed LOS, which loads the corresponding clickloan module onto the user's hard drive. The clickloan module detects all installments of the selected LOS and each installation director is added to an “LOS Path” combo box. Alternatively, the user can select the appropriate LOS. The user selects a path, and the file selection panel for the loans located at that path is then displayed. The control is designed to default to the most recently selected path, and the next time the module is loaded, it will activate that path. Every time another path, folder, or mode is selected, the clickloan module automatically updates the file selection panel to display the loans for the selected path.In some situations the LOS package has been installed on the network from one computer, but the computer on which the clickloan module is loaded has not done workstation installation. In this case the registry and initialization (INI) files will not contain any record of installation paths. As a result, the combo box with path list will be empty and the clickloan control will display a message stating that the particular LOS installation has not been detected. In this case, the user must type the path to the network installation into the Path field. The clickloan module will determine the existence of the directory and the LOS exact name of the installation path. A “browse” button can also be used to locate the installation directory. Once clickloan finds the LOS, it will immediately display the file selection panel.After the first visit to the wholesale lender's web site, the user will typically click the “Submit Loan from LOS” or a similarly labeled icon to submit a loan application. The system will create a pipeline report indicating all of the loans currently in process. To submit a loan, the user will highlight the loan and press the submit button at the bottom of the files selection panel, or simply double-click on the loan icon.In one embodiment, the loan is exported to DU version 3 format, and an XML envelope is created. The DU3 file is put into “CDATA” section under <LoanData> tag. All the assigned properties (mandatory and optional) plus Transaction ID are listed under <property> tag. The format for a sample XML file is as follows:<?xml version = “1.0”?>- <ClickLoan_Envelope>  - <Properties> <VendorID>234375/<Vendor ID> <ActionType>1<Action Type> <UserID>1234567</UserID> <IncompleteDataAction>2</Incomplete Data Action> <FrameName> SomeFrame</FrameName> <TransactionID> CL_{6567643E-AD19-4AEC-BACD 741E83A85576} </TransactionID>  </Properties> - <LoanData Format = “FNMA30”>  - <!CDATA  DU3 data goes here  ]]>  </LoanData>  </ClickLoan_Envelope> Once the XML file is created, it is sent to the URL, mapped to the particular Vendor ID and Action Type. As a response, the user receives an HTML page displaying the status of the request or links directing them further.In order to integrate the clickloan module in the lender web site, the lender inserts the clickloan control into a web page using the <OBJECT> tag in the HTML page and referring to the ClassID of clickloan control.The codebase attribute indicates where the CAB file is located. It is important to note that the version number has to be specified in the CODEBASE attribute, and it should correspond to the version of the control. Every time the web browser (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer) navigates to the Web page, the version of the currently installed component is compared to the version specified in codebase attribute. If codebase version is higher, the new CAB file is downloaded and installed. Otherwise already installed clickloan control is loaded. It is therefore generally necessary to update the version in codebase with the current version number of the clickloan control.In one embodiment, the clickloan CAB files are hosted on the loan origination system server 102. All the vendors are provided with URLs for these files, and the codebase attributes should point to those URLs.Once the clickloan module has been inserted into a web page, there are several properties that need to be set by the hosting web page. To set these properties, a set properties (SetProperties(BSTR PropName, BSTR PropValue)) function is made available to be used within the script tag of the web page. This function is called as a method of clickloan object using the name specified by ID attribute of object tag.The following mandatory properties are set by the user once the control has been inserted: vendor identifier, action type, user identifier, incomplete data action, and frame name. The vendor identifier (VendorlD) is the unique ID assigned by the loan broker computer 102 to every vendor. The action type (ActionType) is an integer specifying what action is being taken by that web page. This integer will map to the URL to which the date is to be submitted. For example, a loan submission can be assigned action type 1, and loan registration can be assigned type 2. The vendor then specifies that for action type 1, the data is to be posted to one URL and for action type 2 the data is submitted to a different URL. The user identifier (UserID) is the ID used to login to the lender web site.The incomplete data action (IncompleteDataAction) variable tells the clickloan module what to do if the loan file being uploaded has missing data according to DU file format requirements. If the property is set to 0, the user is allowed to continue uploading the file despite some missing data. This is the default, and in this mode the file would be checked, and if any missing data were found, a list would be displayed to the user to help them locate the missing fields. The user will have the option to continue the submission or cancel it. If this property is set to 1, the user will see a list of missing fields, however, there is no option for uploading incomplete files. If the property is set to 2, incomplete data warning and the list of missing fields will be ignored, and submission of the data will be allowed. Different loan origination system programs 118 may have different default settings for this parameter. The frame name (FrameName) parameter specifies the name of the frame to which the resulting page should be targeted.Besides the listed properties, other properties (XML nodes) can be added to the XML file. For example PropName and PropValue can be assigned any value that the user specifies. All these properties will be posted to the lender site.

Such a system is described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/172,844, entitled “Online System for Fulfilling Loan Applications From Loan Originators.” FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary network system for processing loan applications, according to this alternative embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the LOS program or programs resident on the broker computer 602 are also coupled to a loan origination system computer 622. This computer executes several program modules that manage the loan origination process and comprise the processing and submission system. These can include a business center process 628, one or more back-end processes 630, and a data storage facility 632. In one embodiment, the business center 628 contains a network interface that provides access between the loan origination system program and other entities. For the embodiment in which the network comprises the Internet, the interface may be a web-based interface. In this case, the business center 628 includes a web browser client process 606 executed on the loan broker computer. The back-end processes 630 comprise the processing and submission system servers that provide downloadable program modules to the loan origination program and/or perform calculations for the loan origination program. The data storage facility 632 stores various data related to the lenders and users within the system.The business center process 628 within the data center 626 includes the software module comprising a processing and submission system that implements business and processing logic modules for receiving loan application information from a borrower (such as 1003 data for mortgage loans), storing data related to the borrower, providing interfaces to processes utilized by lenders and other third parties that fulfill and settle the loan. In one embodiment, the data stored by the data center is used by the loan origination system programs 608 and provided to the broker through the lender web site 612 for processing and display.As illustrated in FIG. 6, the loan broker computer 602 is coupled through the business center process 628 to loan underwriters 648, and one or more settlement service vendors 644. These entities perform the function of fulfilling and settling the loan application. These entities generally access the loan origination system program of the broker computer through the web browser interface of the business center 628. The business center also provides facilities to set up storefront type interfaces for lenders to customize their offerings, and provides an information portal for brokers. Such a portal and storefront interface may be utilized by the lenders and/or vendors to generate and maintain a web site presence on the Internet, such as through lender web site 612.One or more of the loan underwriters 640 reviews the loan application and approves or denies the application. One example of a mortgage loan underwriter is the Fannie Mae company, which does not itself provide loan funds but works with lenders to assure that the funds are available. Lenders 604 are typically banks, savings and loans, or other financial institutions that provide the loan funds. The settlement service vendors provide services and information required to close the loan. Such vendors include appraisers, credit reporting agencies, document preparers, flood certification agencies, and the like. Other third party entities that may be interfaced to the broker computer may include loan servicers who collect monthly payments from the borrower, and other similar loan process companies. The lenders and vendors may maintain web sites as a point of contact for brokers over the Internet.The business center module 628 of the loan originator computer 622 accesses one or more loan origination system programs 608. The loan origination software programs 608 utilized by the loan broker can be a proprietary system or a commercially available system. Examples of present commercially available loan origination system programs include Genesis™, Contour™, Calyx Point™, and Byte™, as described previously, among other similar LOS programs. Alternatively, the loan broker may utilize a standard Internet web site to interface with the borrower and provide some degree of loan origination software functionality.Operation of the loan origination system 622 for a loan application process initiated by broker 602 is described in the aforementioned co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/172,844, entitled “Online System for Fulfilling Loan Applications From Loan Originators,” which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.Although embodiments and examples of the present invention have been described with reference to specific programming languages (such as HTML) and structures, it should be noted that alternative embodiments may be implemented using different languages and structures. Furthermore, although embodiments of the present invention have been described with reference to a network implementation comprising the Internet and Internet-related web browsing and web serving technologies, it should be noted that alternative embodiments of the present invention can be implemented on many other types of networks and network protocols, such as proprietary protocols for local area networks, wide area networks, and any combination thereof.The present invention has been described primarily in relation to loan applications for personal home mortgage loans. It should be noted, however, that many other types of loans can be processed through the embodiments described herein, such as commercial loans, any type of personal loan, home equity loans, and the like.In the foregoing, a user interface system for processing and submitting loan applications through a network of loan originators and lender computer systems has been described. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.

Abstract
Background and Purpose—For its current dimensions, stroke represents the world’s primary health challenge. In China stroke is the second most common cause of death. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has for many centuries been used, and it is still widely used today in countries of south and east Asia for the treatment of people with stroke. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate whether complex Traditional Chinese Medicine (cTCM) improves poststroke motor recovery. In particular, we defined cTCM as intervention that included at least acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine.
Methods—An extensive search including PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to December 2007. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) about cTCM for motor dysfunction of poststroke were searched irrespective of any language. The quality of each trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Reviewers’ Handbook 4.2.6.
Results—After selection of 11 234 articles, 34 RCTs and quasi-RCTs were included. All these trials were conducted in China and published on Chinese journals. All trials but one reported results in favor of cTCM treatments suggesting a strong publication bias. Because of the significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was performed and thus no cumulative result was obtained pooling data of RCTs.
Conclusions—What appears from this systematic review is that scant data are available to evaluate efficacy of cTCM for poststroke motor dysfunction. Most of the primary studies available for this review were inadequately designed trials characterized by unknown dropout rates and definitional vagueness in outcomes measures. None of the studies approached important end points like death, survival times, rate of dependency, reduction in length of stay in hospital, etc. The key to lead to evidence-based practices is establishing a consensus on standardized relevant outcome measures and then designing and conducting appropriate RCTs that adopt those standards.
traditional Chinese medicinesystematic reviewstrokerehabilitationAnnually, 15 million people worldwide suffer from stroke. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are left permanently disabled. Stroke is the biggest single cause of major disability. As such, stroke represents a heavy burden both on family and community.1In China official statistics data show that stroke is the second most common cause of death among both urban and rural residents (117 per 100 000 per year in cities, and 112 per 100 000 in rural populations). The age-adjusted stroke prevalence in China varies from 259 per 100 000 to 719 per 100 000 for all ages.2Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has for many centuries been used, and it is still widely used today in countries of south and east Asia for the treatment of people with stroke. With the purpose of investigating the appropriate scientific evidence for TCM the Italian National Institute of Health and the Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine have implemented a common project, the Joint Sino-Italian Laboratory (JoSIL) on TCM. This systematic review was conducted within the framework of JoSIL.Many systematic reviews of Chinese traditional treatments in stroke rehabilitation have been published, mainly on Chinese journals. Some systematic reviews were delivered by the Cochrane Library, mainly related to the acute phase of stroke. Most of these studies investigated the role of acupuncture or Chinese herbal medicines alone with contradictory conclusions.3–6 TCM includes acupuncture, massage, physical exercise, and Chinese herbal medicines, which are usually used in combination in clinical practice. However, whether or not the combinations of these treatments are truly effective for stroke is still unknown. The objective of our systematic review was to determine whether complex TCM treatments (cTCM) improves poststroke motor recovery. In particular, we defined cTCM as intervention that included at least acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine.
Methods

Types of Studies
Randomized and quasirandomized clinical trials to evaluate cTCM for poststroke interventions up to December 2007 were searched irrespective of language. Quasi-RCTs are trials that use approaches to allocate patients, such as alternation, case record numbers, birth date, etc. These methods of allocation are relatively easy to manipulate, introducing selection bias.


Types of Participants
Trials including patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke of any age or sex were eligible. Stroke had to be diagnosed according to the World Health Organization definition or to the corresponding diagnostic criteria adopted in China,7–10 or confirmed by computerized tomography or MRI. Trials that included patients in an acute phase (within 10 days from onset) were excluded. The reason for this choice depends on the fact that we wanted to investigate the effectiveness of cTCM on motor function in the rehabilitation stage and not in the acute phase. In the acute phase the patients are at high risk and their treatment should comply, also in China, with the International guidelines. A 10-day interval from the onset was adopted in some clinical trials to distinguish the acute/non acute stroke phase (eg, http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00849303). Trials of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were not considered.


Types of Interventions
We included in our review only trials that included at least acupuncture and some kind of herbal medicine. Either traditional acupuncture in which the needles were inserted in classical meridian points or acupuncture in which the needles were inserted in nonmeridian or trigger points were considered, regardless of the source of stimulation (for example, manual or electric stimulation). “Injectio ad acumen” acupuncture was also included, this technique consists of injecting Chinese medicine into certain acupoints. All the preparations of different Chinese herbs or extractions were considered. All studies were required to have treatment duration of at least 1 week.


Types of Outcome Measures
All the trials concerning the patients and the treatments previously described were considered eligible for our review independently from the outcomes studied (death, activities of daily living [ADL], functional recovery, quality of life [QoL], etc.).


Study Selection
To identify all relevant articles, a comprehensive search was performed in December 2007. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2008, issue 1), PubMed (1950–2007), EMBASE (1980–2007), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1978–2007).11 We also searched other Chinese journal databases (Chinese Journal Full-Text Database12 and Scientific Journal Database13) to identify thesis and conference articles. The search terms used were “traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, massage, scraping, ventouse, acupoint, complex therapy” and “stroke, apoplexy, brain infarction, cerebral infarction, hematencephalon, encephalorrhagia, hemorrhage.”
These terms were used as free-text terms (translated to Chinese) to search some of the Chinese databases. Free-text and MeSH terms were used to search CBM, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Free-text and Emtree terms were used to search EMBASE.
We also examined the bibliographies of all of the considered publications so as to identify other studies. Two reviewers (Zhang Junhua and Shang Hongcai) independently examined titles and abstracts of the trials for inclusion, based on the selection criteria outlined above. A table with the English translation of all the titles and a summary of the articles was prepared and reviewed by a third investigator (Francesca Menniti-Ippolito). The full texts of articles were retrieved if there was any doubt whether an article should be excluded or not. Inconsistencies were solved through discussion. The selected trials that were claimed to be randomized were retrieved and then examined for confirmation that they were indeed correctly randomized.


Quality Assessment of Trials Included
A quality assessment was carried out for all the retrieved studies. Quality in a systematic review refers essentially to the absence of biases.
The main biases in a clinical trial can derive from systematic differences between comparison groups in: measured or unmeasured baseline characteristics because of the way participants were selected or assigned (selection bias), care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated (performance bias), how outcomes are ascertained, diagnosed or verified (detection bias), withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the results of a study (attrition bias).
To assess the methodological validity of the studies included in this review the following aspects were evaluated (according to a binary score presence/absence): randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and description of follow-up. According to Cochrane reviewers’ Handbook14 3 categories were defined: (1) all quality criteria met: (low risk of bias); (2) one or more of the quality criteria only partly met (moderate risk of bias); (3) one or more criteria not met (high risk of bias).
Articles were assessed by 2 reviewers (Zhang Junhua and Shang Hongcai) independently. Disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third reviewer (Gao Xiumei).


Data Extraction
The information on patients, methods, interventions, outcomes, and results was extracted and summarized by 4 reviewers (Zhang Junhua, Xiong Jun, Xu Yuanyuan, Zhang Xin) using a standardized data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved through discussion among all investigators. For dichotomous outcomes, the number of responders and the total number of participants for each study arm were extracted. For continuous outcomes (eg, deficit of neurological score), the mean change and standard deviation for the mean in each group of the trial were extracted along with the total number.


Data Analysis
In this study, statistical analysis was performed using software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration (Review Manager 5).15
We did not perform any estimate of pooled effect because of clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the trials included in the review.


Results

Search Flow
An initial screening yielded 11 235 potentially relevant citations in accordance with the search strategy. According to the inclusion criteria, on the basis of the titles and abstracts, 11 166 articles were excluded. These studies were mainly excluded because duplicates of the same articles included in different databases, because the tested treatments were not cTCM, or because they were not RCTs. After the full text reading of 69 articles, 35 studies were further excluded mainly because they had included patients in the acute phase of stroke. Ultimately, 34 studies were included for analysis (see Figure 1). All of the trials were conducted in China and published on Chinese journals in Chinese language (only 3 papers had an English abstract). All the included studies were single-center, parallel-design and claimed to have applied randomization.

Characteristics of the Trials Included in the Systematic Review
The main characteristics of the 34 trials are presented in Table 1⇓.16–49 The number of participants included in each of the studies ranged from 39 to 398, with a total of 4521 patients (2403 patients in the investigational groups) in the 34 studies. The proportion of males was approximately 61.5%. The age of the participants ranged from 35 years to 92 years. Eleven of the trials included patients with ischemic stroke only, and the remaining included patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The time from stroke onset to the inclusion in the trial ranged from 12 days to 6 years. In 27 of the trials diagnostic criteria for stroke were specified, and in 20 inclusion criteria were defined. Only 8 trials reported a complete description of all selection criteria for the subjects (eg, diagnosis, inclusion, exclusion criteria). The baseline characteristics of the participants were available for 26 studies.

Table 1. Continued
Almost all trials, but 6, adopted a design in which patients were allocated to receive either control treatments or control treatments plus experimental treatments (A+B versus B design).
We classified the trials according to the control group treatments in 4 different groups: acupuncture alone (with or without physical exercise); Chinese herbal medicine alone; Western medicine (with or without any other Chinese treatment or physical exercise); physical exercise. The duration of therapy ranged from 10 days to 3 months.
There was only 1 placebo-controlled study (placebo defined as starch capsules+decoction of Henon Bamboo leaf+sham acupuncture).16 The most tested herbal preparation was Buyanghuanwu decoction (8 of the trials). Buyanghuanwu is a traditional Chinese prescription for decoction that has been used clinically to treat paralysis in China for hundreds of years. The decoction contains earth worms and 6 medicinal herbs as raw material without any extraction or standardization: Huang Qi (Radix Astragali), Dang Gui (Radix Angelicae Sinensis), Chuan Xiong (Rhizoma Chuanxiong), Chi Shao (Radix Paeoniae Rubrae), Tao Ren (Semen Persicae), Hong Hua (Flos Carthami Tinctorii). Another frequently tested preparation was Mailuoling, administered as injection, made by extracting herbal Shi Hu (Herba Dendrobii), Xuan Shen (Radix Scrophularia), Jin Yin Hua (Flos Lonicerae), and Niu Xi (Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae). The most commonly used acupoints are listed in Table 2.

Table 2. Commonly Used Acupoints in Included Studies
A variety of outcome measures were reported. No data on death or dependency at the end of follow-up were available in any of the trials included. The “Effective Rate” (ER) was the most commonly used measure to evaluate efficacy (used in 29 of the trials). This measure is extensively cited in Chinese biomedical literature to define the proportion of responders to treatments or interventions. For poststroke treatments a “responder” was defined on the basis of a combined evaluation of muscle strength, and functional independence measure (FIM) or activities of daily living (Barthel ADL Index). Two of the trials used the Fugl-Meyer motor function assessment as an index.36,41 Two of the trials used the FIM as an index.36,48 Only 1 trial reported the neurological deficit score.49 Other outcome measures are indicated in Table 1⇑. Adverse events were reported in 1 trial only.16


Methodological Quality
All the included studies indicated randomization, with only 2 of the trials reporting that the random sequence was generated by a random digits table.34,42 Three trials allocated patients by the sequence of admission.22,37,48 No trial described allocation concealment or mentioned blinding procedures. None of the trials described withdrawal and intention-to-treat analyses. Only 1 of the trials reported data on follow-up observations.43 In general, the methodological quality of the trials included was poor. According to the Cochrane handbook, all of the trials included were of low quality classified as “C”.


Effectiveness
Almost all the trials (29/34) used the ER as an outcome measure. For these studies an “effective rate ratio” (ERR) was calculated as the ratio between the proportion of responders in the treatment group and the proportion of responders in the control group. All trials but 1 reported ERR in favor of cTCM treatments (in 15 trials the ERR was statistically significant). The results of the studies using the ERR measure are reported in the forest plot in Figure 2.

A strong publication bias is present in our review as can be seen by the asymmetry of the funnel plot reported in Figure 3. Five trials used only continuous outcomes (eg, deficit of neurological score), in these the mean change and standard deviation for the mean were considered as effectiveness measures.

cTCMs Versus Acupuncture
As illustrated in Figure 2, 4 of the 12 trials of cTCM versus acupuncture alone showed statistically significant higher ERR after treatment with the cTCM. These results can be summarized as: Buyanghuanwu decoction plus acupuncture was more effective than acupuncture alone (ERR, 1.37: 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.85)34; a mixed powder of Panax pseudo-Ginseng and Leech (Sanqi and Shuizhi) plus acupuncture was more effective than acupuncture alone (ERR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.80)38; Jinmaikangfu decoction plus acupuncture was more effective than acupuncture alone (ERR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.08)23; Mailuoling injection plus acupuncture was more effective than acupuncture alone (ERR, 1.11: 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.20).17 The remaining 8 trials did not show statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups.
In 2 other trials the control group included acupuncture plus physical exercise. Only 1 showed a statistically significant result: Huonaotang decoction, acupuncture, and physical exercise was more effective than physical exercise plus acupuncture (ERR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.31).20


cTCMs Versus Herbal Medicine
Five of 12 trials showed statistically significant higher ERR after treatment with the cTCMs as compared to herbal medicine alone. These results can be summarized as: Buyanghuanwu decoction plus acupuncture was more effective than Buyanghuanwu decoction alone in 3 trials21,28,34; treatment with herbal medicine prescribed on the basis of individual symptoms and signs plus common and head acupuncture was more effective than herbal medicines (ERR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.39)22; Yindan Xinnaotong capsule plus acupuncture was more effective than Danshen injection (ERR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.42).48 This study reported also a statistically significant result on activities of daily living using FIM (WMD, 8.42; 95% CI, 5.85 to 10.99), but not on neurological deficit.
Activities of daily living and effects of motor function were investigated respectively with FIM the Fugl-Meyer scale in a study on acupuncture plus Simiaoyongan decoction and Buyanghuanwu decoction. Acupuncture plus Simiaoyongan decoction was more effective than Buyanghuanwu decoction (WMD, 26.2; 95% CI, 18.56 to 33.84).36


cTCMs Versus Western Medicines (With or Without Chinese Treatments)
Four of 7 trials showed statistically significant higher ERRs after treatment with the cTCMs compared to Western medicine (with or without Chinese treatments). These results can be summarized as: Dihuang Yinzi plus acupuncture was more effective than aspirin plus high pressure oxygen (ERR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.12)45; Yiqihuoxue medicine plus acupuncture was more effective than piracetam (ERR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.35)29; Buyanghuawu decoction plus acupuncture and rehabilitation exercise was more effective than piracetam plus vitamin E and compound Danshen tablets (ERR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.66)31; acupuncture, massage, physical exercise and Xesaitong plus cytidine triphosphate (CTP) was more effective than physical exercise and Xesaitong plus CTP (ERR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.30).43


cTCMs Versus Physical Exercise
Treatment with herbal medicines based on symptoms and signs plus acupuncture, bath, injectio ad acumen, and rehabilitation exercise was more effective than placebo (defined as starch capsules+decoction of Henon Bamboo leaf+sham acupuncture) plus physical exercise (ERR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.47 to 2.82).16


Adverse Events
Only 1 study reported adverse events: 5 patients in the cTCMs group of 121 patients had mild stomach discomfort.16


Discussion
One of the most important aspects of our review refers to the methodological approach adopted in the studies. In our systematic review, in fact, it was not possible to find well-designed trials to evaluate efficacy of complex TCM treatments for the management of poststroke motor dysfunction. Most of the trials included in this review used an “A+B versus B” design where patients are randomized to receive a control treatment (the Control Group) versus a control treatment plus the experimental treatment (the Treatment Group). This kind of design is quite popular in acupuncture studies where acupuncture is added to usual care; nevertheless, it is likely to generate false-positive results. Without a rigorous control for placebo effect, by using nonpenetrating or sham devices or placebo herbal medicine in the control group, the results of these studies would be positive because of nonspecific-placebo effects related to the additional care given to patients in the treatment group, or by the disappointment experienced by patients of the control group, when not receiving the experimental treatments they may have hoped for.50
Because of the significant clinical heterogeneity (eg, different interventions, different time since stroke onset), it was not possible to perform a pooling analysis of the trials. Fourteen trials did not define the time to onset of stroke, and 11 trials included patients with long intervals to stroke onset (from 12 days to 6 years). This can affect the external validity of the studies (ie, the extent to which the observed effects could be generalized in the clinical practice).
With regard to the quality of reporting of the trials a common shortcoming was the inadequate description of the randomization and blinding procedures. A large number of these trials actually claimed to be RCTs, but most of the authors have apparently misunderstood the full concept of randomization. Allocation concealment was not reported in any of the trials included. Other important weaknesses were the very poor descriptions of dropouts and of harm-related issues (none of the trials reported patient withdrawals, and only 1 study described the occurrence of adverse events).
As far as the herbal medicines are concerned, quality control of herbal preparations is not mentioned in trial reports, although this is crucial for the validity of the study results. To assess the efficacy of a specific product in a clinical study, all participants should be given exactly the same intervention in terms of product identity, purity, dosage, and formulation.
Overall, because of the poor methodological qualities of the studies, the results of the trials included in this systematic review are likely to be biased by many factors. Furthermore, because the review included only articles published on the Chinese literature, a location bias cannot be excluded (ie, trials published in low or nonimpact factor journals are more likely to report significant results than those published in high-impact mainstream medical journals) as demonstrated by the asymmetry of the funnel plot shown in Figure 3.
Also other systematic reviews of TCM had encountered similar problems, and the Chinese Government is stimulating, through huge investments, the improvement of the studies aiming to prove the efficacy of Chinese medicine according to International standards. In our review only 2 of the 34 selected articles declared the source of funding.
A critical element in conducting systematic reviews is having access to all relevant publications that address the clinical question. There is the possibility that in our review we were not able to identify all relevant studies. Important results may have been published in reports, technical reports, discussion papers or other formats which were not indexed in the databases we used. Comprehensive identification of such “gray literature” is hard to achieve. Another possible limitation of our review is that we did not have the opportunity to contact study authors for obtaining additional information about the included studies.
The primary studies available for this review were mostly inadequately designed trials characterized by unknown dropout rates and definitional vagueness in outcomes measures.
None of the studies included in our review approached important end points like, for example, death, survival times, rate of dependency, reduction in length of stay in hospital or long term care institution, etc. All the trials were actually focused on ancillary or surrogate outcomes measured through subjective qualitative scores (ie, “notable,” “effective,” “ineffective,” etc). In all the trials the duration of therapy and follow-up was indeed too short to allow to achieve conclusive results on more relevant outcomes.
Both these aspects (the low clinical relevance and the methods adopted to measure the end points) demonstrate the need to approach with more rigorous tools the study of a possible role of TCM in stroke. The key to lead to evidence-based practices is in establishing a consensus on standardized relevant outcome measures and then designing and conducting appropriate RCTs that adopt those standards.
