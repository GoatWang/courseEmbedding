BANK'34 and Bank 1440 Announce Execution of Merger Agreement

Jun 26, 2013, 12:52 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Alamogordo Financial Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


ALAMOGORDO, N.M., June 26, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- BANK'34 and its parent corporation Alamogordo Financial Corp. (OTCQB: ALMG), headquartered in Alamogordo, New Mexico, and Bank 1440 (OTCQB: BFFO), headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, jointly announced the execution of an agreement and plan of merger for the two community banks.  
The announcement was issued by Randal L. Rabon, Chairman of the Board of Directors of BANK'34, and Michael Mandell, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank 1440.  "Our respective boards and executive management teams share a common vision for this opportunity, that being a true union of complementary community banks," said Mr. Rabon.  Mr. Mandell confirmed these sentiments, "Randy and I are committed to combining two community banks in a manner that serves the best long term interests of our respective customers, communities, employees and shareholders."
In connection with the transaction, common and preferred shareholders of Bank 1440 will have the right to elect to receive either cash or shares of Alamogordo Financial Corp. common stock, or a combination, subject to exchange ratios and proration procedures set forth in the merger agreement.  Based upon Alamogordo Financial Corp's. closing price as of June 25, 2013, the transaction is valued at $3.41 per share of Bank 1440 stock or approximately $7.6 million in the aggregate.  
The merger transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by Bank 1440 shareholders and applicable banking regulators.  Alamogordo Financial Corp. intends to file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to its shares of common stock to be issued in the transaction.
Following the merger with Bank 1440, BANK'34 is projected to have assets above $260 million and a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio exceeding 11%.  Bank 1440 branches will become branches of BANK'34.  The combined business franchise will include four full-service banking center locations, including  Alamogordo and Las Cruces in southern New Mexico and Peoria and Phoenix in Maricopa County, Arizona. 
Jill Gutierrez, Chief Executive Officer of BANK'34, will continue to serve in this same capacity after the merger.  Ms. Gutierrez stated, "In an era of big banks, we are committed to the preservation of a true community banking model across the entire BANK'34 franchise.  Bank 1440's dedicated employees will endure as the faces, heart and soul of the BANK'34 franchise in Arizona."    
BANK'34 was chartered in 1934.  Bank 1440 was chartered in 2007.  Both franchises offer a complement of consumer and business banking services.  In addition to market diversification, the combined business models will create enhanced product lines and expertise across the entire franchise, including SBA lending and residential mortgages.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc, acted as financial advisor to BANK'34 and Alamogordo Financial Corp. and Luse Gorman Pomerenk & Schick, P.C. acted as its legal counsel.  FIG Partners, LLC acted as financial advisor to Bank 1440 and Fenimore, Harrison, Kay & Ford, LLP acted as its legal counsel.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/23/2015
            

                BBB has determined that Bank'34 meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
