PEO Pricing 




Shopping for a PEO? Learn how PEO pricing works and how to compare the value of PEO services.
You’ve worked hard to grow your company, but because of all the day-to-day administrative hassles you face you’re having difficulty finding time to effectively manage and develop your business. You’ve done your homework, researched Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) and discovered they can help you offer better benefits and keep your company compliant with HR and labor laws, allowing you to focus more time on growing your company.
You know what a PEO can do and you’ve decided to hire one. But now you’re wondering, what is the next step when partnering with PEO agencies, and how does PEO pricing work?
The cost of PEO services.
As with any product or service, the old adage that you get what you pay for also holds true with PEOs. The cheapest PEO isn’t always the way to go; you’ll want to engage the best PEO you can afford that also gives you the services you want. Since your PEO will be handling many important functions of your business, such as regulatory compliance and federal/state taxes, the cost for service varies.
When evaluating price, pay particular attention to the services that are included, if the PEO has a local presence, how proactive they are in their service delivery and that you are comparing apples with apples. There should be a fair correlation between value and price. In most cases PEOs charge in two ways: either a flat per-employee, per-year charge (PEPY), or as a percentage of total payroll.
A per-employee, per-year PEO quote simply charges a flat fee per employee. This helps make the company’s expenses more predictable. The second method of PEO pricing is calculated by taking a percentage of the total payroll for each pay period (typically between 3-8 percent). A good PEO can charge by either method depending on your requirements and preference.
In both scenarios, you might incur additional fees because of other value-added offerings such as additional employee benefits, talent management products and recruitment services. Still, growing companies often find that it is very typical for the cost of PEO services to be less than the cost of hiring one additional full-time employee.
What services am I paying for when I partner with a PEO?

HR compliance and expertise
Payroll and tax administration
Workplace safety and risk management
Employee benefits
Benefits administration
Access to HR technology
Performance and talent management

 
Getting started with a PEO.
If providing workers’ compensation, health care, unemployment costs and other HR needs is becoming increasingly difficult for your company, a PEO may be the answer for you.
The cost of HR and benefits is increasing every year, and companies can find it favorable to enter a PEO arrangement because it allows them to provide better benefits and HR services at a price they can afford. With the ever-changing state and federal regulations being passed, companies are also finding that they don’t have the resources to keep up with those changes.

G&A helps us compete with the bigger guys.


 
“I’ve always wanted to own my own business. But as we started to grow, it became harder and harder to compete with the bigger companies for the best talent because I just couldn’t beat their benefit offerings. Partnering with G&A has allowed me to offer the same high-quality benefits as even the largest corporation, all at a price I can afford.”

G&A gave us a high-quality, affordable HR solution.


 
“As our organization has grown to include more staff and programs, we realized we just didn’t have the resources or expertise to keep up with our HR needs. That’s when we called G&A – they’ve allowed us to reduce our administrative overhead and take better care of our employees. I used to think we couldn’t afford to outsource our HR – now I know we can’t afford not to.”

	on their own — simply put, they need a little help. Instead of taking on additional overhead and hiring someone who may not work out, many of these companies choose to
	 outsource human resources functions to an outside company that specializes in HR.
Today, most businesses outsource at least one of their human resources functions. There is no limit to the types of HR functions that can be outsourced: payroll, 
	benefits, HR compliance, 
	workplace safety, recruitment, 
	performance management, and more. 
Outsourcing HR functions like these allows businesses to streamline their organizations, minimize HR noncompliance risk, increase employee productivity, and reduce labor and administrative costs. These aren’t the only benefits of businesses that outsource HR enjoy, however.

There are a wide variety of reasons a business might choose to outsource its human resources functions. Below are a few of the benefits of outsourcing HR:
Reducing costs
The potential for cost savings is often the most compelling benefit of outsourcing HR. Immediate savings often stem from reducing human resources headcount, 
	consolidating systems and software, and the ability of the HR outsourcing provider to procure health insurance, workers’ compensation and other benefits and 
	coverages at much lower rates than small and medium-businesses could secure on their own. 
Realizing greater operating efficiencies
Outsourcing human resources functions gives businesses access to a team of HR experts, proven processes and sophisticated systems, all of which help streamline
	 human resources management and help companies manage their workforces more efficiently. 
Maintaining compliant
Business owners are expected to comply with dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of complex federal, state and local laws, and failing to maintain compliance with 
	just one of these can expose the business to thousands of dollars in penalties and litigation costs. By helping employers develop and implement sound human resources 
	policies and practices, HR outsourcing companies provide the added layer of security and protection businesses need.
Focusing on the core
Human resources is an essential component of every business, but HR isn’t typically a company’s core business. Instead, companies are involved in manufacturing goods, 
	marketing products or delivering services. Human resource outsourcing companies alleviate the burdens and complexities that surround workers and their issues, like payroll, 
	employee benefits and workplace safety, allowing business owners to focus their time, talent and energy on their core business. 
Learn how to decide whether HR outsourcing is right for your business.


Even if they believe outsourcing HR will almost surely result in cost savings, business owners and executives are often hesitant to make what they see as a dramatic 
	change to how their company operates. 
Making a list of all the pros and cons of outsourcing HR functions can be a helpful exercise for businesses considering outsourcing HR for the first time. This list 
	should include advantages of outsourcing HR (access to affordable employee benefits, lower overhead costs, increased employee productivity, etc.), as well as any potential 
	disadvantages of outsourcing HR (the cost of outsourcing HR, less involvement in day-to-day administrative functions of the business, etc.). 
Below is a list of questions to consider while making a list of the pros and cons of outsourcing HR:
1.	&nbsp Is there a real, tangible benefit to performing this function in-house?
2.	Could an outside vendor manage this function more effectively or efficiently than your internal staff?
3.	Are your employees struggling to keep pace with all of the current and expected demands of this function?
4.	Is your organization expending valuable resources on HR that could be better spent elsewhere?
Once you’ve made the decision to outsource HR, the next step is to choose what kind of outsourcing partner you’ll need.
Learn more about the types of HR outsourcing companies


There are four basic types of companies that provide outsourced human resource management:
HR Consulting Firms
An HR consulting firm works best for businesses that need limited assistance or assistance with a specific project. HR consulting companies are most often utilized to 
	help businesses identify problem areas or weaknesses they may have in regards to human resources, and propose a plan the business can use to address the identified problems. 
	Once the project or issue is resolved, the partnership ends.
HR Technology Vendors
Some companies have the infrastructure and resources to manage their HR functions internally, but just lack the tools or technology to do so efficiently. In these cases, a 
	third-party vendor that can provide access to an online HR technology platform the business’ internal HR team can use to manage one or more of their HR functions (most often payroll) electronically.
HR Outsourcing (HRO) / Administrative Services Organizations (ASO)
Companies who decide they need more expertise or ongoing service may choose to outsource all or some of their HR functions to a human resources outsourcing (HRO) firm or 
	administrative services organization (ASO). Under these arrangements, the outside provider actually takes over one or more of tasks associated with human resources, including 
	but not limited to: payroll processing, benefits administration, regulatory compliance, etc.
Professional Employer Organizations (PEO)
Companies looking for a turnkey HR department often choose to partner with a PEO. In a professional employer organization (PEO) arrangement, businesses enter into a co-employment 
	relationship with an HR outsourcing company, which allows the PEO to perform employment-related tasks for the employees on the company’s behalf, and allows the business to enjoy all 
	the benefits of a turnkey HR department. 
Not all HR outsourcing companies are created equal. See what makes a top HR outsourcing company.
