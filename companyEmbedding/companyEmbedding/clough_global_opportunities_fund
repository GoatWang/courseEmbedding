Clough Global Opportunities Fund






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2017 10:00 AM EDT













 




























































  On June 30, 2017, the Clough Global Opportunities Fund (NYSE MKT: GLO) (the "Fund"), a closed-end fund, paid a monthly distribution on its common stock of $0.0860 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 19, 2017.  The following table sets forth the estimated amount of the sources of distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the related rules adopted thereunder. The Fund estimates the following percentages, of the total distribution amount per share, attributable to (i) current and prior fiscal year net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return of capital or other capital source as a percentage of the total distribution amount. These percentages are disclosed for the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative distribution amount per share for the Fund.     Â    Â    Â    Â    Â    Â    Â      Current Distribution from:   Â    Â      Â    Â              Per Share ($)       %     Net Investment Income       0.0000       0.00   %     Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain       0.0000       0.00   %     Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain       0.0000       0.00   %     Return of Capital or other Capital Source       0.0860       100.00   %     Total (per common share)       0.0860       100.00   %                 Â      Fiscal Year-to-Date Cumulative                 Distributions from:                       Per Share ($)       %     Net Investment Income       0.0138       2.01   %     Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain       0.0000       0.00   %     Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain       0.0000       0.00   %     Return of Capital or other Capital Source       0.6742       97.99   %     Total (per common share)   Â    Â    0.6880   Â    Â    100.00   %                 Â       The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and not for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income.'  Presented below are return figures, based on the change in the Fund's Net Asset Value per share ("NAV"), compared to the annualized distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the NAV on the last business day of the month prior to distribution record date.      Fund Performance & Distribution Information     Â      Fiscal Year to Date (11/01/2016 through 5/31/2017)     Annualized Distribution Rate as a Percentage of NAV^   Â    Â    Â    Â    8.94   %     Cumulative Distribution Rate on NAV^   Â    Â    Â    Â    5.96   %     Cumulative Total Return on NAV*   Â    Â    Â    Â    10.78   %     Â    Â    Â    Â    Â    Â      Average Annual Total Return on NAV for the 5 Year Period Ending 5/31/2017**   Â    Â    Â    Â    8.87   %      Past performance is not indicative of future results.  ^ Based on the Fund's NAV as of May 31, 2017.

Clough Global Opportunities Fund
Objective

    The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by applying a fundamental research-driven investment process and will invest in equity and equity-related securities as well as fixed income securities, including both corporate and sovereign debt. The Clough Global Opportunities Fund will invest in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. 
    
Portfolio Content
The Fund intends to invest primarily in a managed mix of U.S. and non-U.S. equity and debt securities. The Fund is flexibly managed so that, depending on the Fund's investment adviser's outlook, it sometimes will be more heavily invested in equity securities or in debt or fixed income securities. The Fund will also, in certain situations, augment its investment positions by purchasing call options, both on specific equity securities, as well as securities representing exposure to equity sectors or indices and fixed income indices. Investments in non-U.S. markets will be made primarily through liquid securities, including depositary receipts (which evidence ownership in underlying foreign securities) and exchange traded funds.

Risks



Disclosure

PRINCIPAL RISKS OF THE FUND
The following is a description of the principal risks of the Fundâs portfolio, which may adversely affect its net asset value and total return. There are other circumstances (including additional risks that are not described here) which could prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective. It is important to read all the disclosure information provided and to understand that you may lose money by investing in the Fund.
Counterparty Risk.
A financial institution or other counterparty with whom the Fund does business, or that underwrites, distributes or guarantees any investments or contracts that the Fund owns or is otherwise exposed to, may decline in financial health and become unable to honor its commitments. This could cause losses for the Fund or could delay the return or delivery of collateral or other assets to the Fund.
Currency Strategies Risk.
The success of the Fundâs currency strategies depends, in part, on the effectiveness and implementation of the Adviserâs analysis and methodology. There can be no assurance that the Adviserâs analysis and methodology will be successful, as this will ultimately depend on many different factors. If these strategies prove unsuccessful, losses to the Fund may be significant and may substantially exceed the intended level of market exposure for the currency strategies. As part of its currency strategies, the Fund will have substantial exposure to the risks of non-U.S. currency markets. Foreign currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and economic or political developments in the United States or abroad. As a result, the Fundâs exposure to foreign currencies could cause lower returns or even losses to the Fund. Although the Adviser seeks to limit these risks through the aggregation of various long and short positions, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. This strategy can have the effect of reducing returns and minimizing opportunities for gain.
Depositary Receipts Risk. 
The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material. Therefore, there may be less information available regarding these issuers and there may not be a correlation between such information and the market value of the depositary receipts. Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may be converted.
Derivatives Risk. 
The Fundâs use of derivatives (which may include forward foreign currency contracts, futures, participation notes, and swaps) may reduce the Fundâs returns and/or increase the volatility of the Fundâs net asset value. Derivatives may be difficult to value and may at times be highly illiquid, and the Fund may not be able to close out or sell a derivative position at a particular time or at an anticipated price. Derivative investments will typically increase the Fundâs exposure to principal risks to which it is otherwise exposed, and may expose the Fund to additional risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, counterparty risk, market risk, credit risk and management risk. 
Equity Security and Stock Market Risk. 
The Fund is affected by how the stock market performs. Equity securities fluctuate in price based on changes in the issuerâs financial condition, as well as market and economic conditions. When stock prices fall, you should expect the value of your investment to fall. Equity or equity-related securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities.
Focus Risk.
To the extent that the Fund focuses its investments in particular asset classes or sectors of the economy, any market price movements, regulatory or technological changes, or economic conditions affecting companies in those asset classes or sectors will have a significant impact on the Fundâs performance.
Foreign Investment Risk.
The Fund faces the risks inherent in foreign investing. Adverse political, economic or social developments could undermine the value of the Fundâs investments or prevent the Fund from realizing its full value. Financial reporting standards for companies based in foreign markets differ from those in the United States. Additionally, foreign securities markets generally are smaller and less liquid than U.S. markets. To the extent that the Fund invests in non-U.S. dollar denominated foreign securities, changes in currency exchange rates may affect the U.S. dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities. To the extent the Fund invests in securities of emerging market issuers, foreign investment risks are greater in emerging markets than in more developed markets. Investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative.
Hedging Risk.
Because the Fund may invest in derivative instruments and ETFs to hedge against foreign currency and/or equity market exposure, the Fund faces the risk that its hedging strategies may not perform as intended. In addition, while the hedging strategies may offset losses, they also may offset gains and typically involve expenses.
Investment Companies Risk. 
Because the Fund may invest in investment companies, such as ETFs and closed- and open-end mutual funds, the Fundâs performance will be directly related to the performance of the investment companies. To the extent that a given investment company underperforms its benchmark or its fund peer group, it may contribute to the underperformance by the Fund. In addition, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses incurred by the investment companies, which lowers the Fundâs performance. To the extent that the Fundâs allocations favor investment companies with higher expenses, the overall cost of investing paid by the Fund will be higher. Also, because shares of ETFs and closed-end funds trade on a securities exchange, their shares may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value.
Investment Themes Risk.
The Fundâs investment program depends on the Adviserâs identification and development of global or regional investment themes, and the Fundâs performance may suffer if such themes, which can be inherently challenging to identify, are not well identified, or do not unfold as anticipated. Failure to correctly identify or develop the themes that will guide the Fundâs portfolio investments, or the failure of a theme to unfold in the way the Adviser anticipates, may result from many causes, including the following: governments or others may decide to oppose or delay certain economic, social or political developments that are the basis of investment themes; demographic or economic data necessary to understand correctly the way in which certain themes may unfold in some countries may be incorrect or incomplete; development of themes and their longevity may require attention to subtle cultural factors not always apparent to outside observers; or social and political changes or natural disasters in some parts of the world may alter the underlying conditions or affect the availability of natural resources necessary to an emerging theme.
Liquidity Risk.
In certain situations, it may be difficult or impossible to sell an investment in an orderly fashion at an acceptable price.
New Fund Risk.
The Fund is a new fund, with limited operating history, which may present additional risk to shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain a viable size. To the extent that the Fund does not grow to or maintain a viable size, it may be liquidated, and the timing of such liquidation may not be favorable to some shareholders.
Portfolio Turnover Risk.
The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities. A high portfolio turnover rate (such as 100% or more) may result in greater expenses to the Fund, including brokerage commissions or dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs on the sale of securities and reinvestments in other securities. A high portfolio turnover rate may also result in an increase in taxable capital gains distributions to the Fundâs shareholders and an increased likelihood that the capital gains will be taxable at ordinary rates.
Preferred Stock Risk.
Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of preferred stock. Preferred stocks are also subject to credit and default risk, which is the possibility that an issuer of preferred stock will fail to make its dividend payments. Preferred stocks do not offer as great a degree of protection of capital or assurance of continued income as investments in corporate debt securities and are subordinated in right of payments to debt obligations. A preferred stock is subject to the risk that its value may decrease based on actual or perceived changes in the business or financial condition of the issuer of the stock, as well as market and economic conditions.
Pricing Risk.
If market conditions make it difficult to value some investments, the Fund may value these investments using more subjective methods, such as fair value pricing. In such cases, the value determined for an investment could be different than the value realized upon such investmentâs sale. As a result, you could pay more than the market value when buying Fund shares or receive less than the market value when selling Fund shares.
Security Selection Risk.
The securities in the Fundâs portfolio may decline in value. The Adviserâs analysis and portfolio management practices may not achieve the desired results.
Short Sale Risk.
If the Fund sells a security short and subsequently has to buy the security back at a higher price, the Fund will lose money on the transaction. Any loss will be increased by the amount of compensation, interest or dividends and transaction costs the Fund must pay to a lender of the security. The amount the Fund could lose on a short sale is theoretically unlimited (as compared to a long position, where the maximum loss is the amount invested). The use of short sales, which has the effect of leveraging the Fund, could increase the exposure of the Fund to the market, increase losses and increase the volatility of returns.
Small Company Risk.
Small company stocks tend to be more volatile than medium-sized or large company stocks. Small companies are less widely followed by stock analysts and less information about them is available to investors. Industry-wide reversals may have a greater impact on small companies, since they may lack the financial resources of larger companies. Small company stocks are typically less liquid than large company stocks.

Clough Global Opportunities Fund
Objective

    The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by applying a fundamental research-driven investment process and will invest in equity and equity-related securities as well as fixed income securities, including both corporate and sovereign debt. The Clough Global Opportunities Fund will invest in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. 
    
Portfolio Content
The Fund intends to invest primarily in a managed mix of U.S. and non-U.S. equity and debt securities. The Fund is flexibly managed so that, depending on the Fund's investment adviser's outlook, it sometimes will be more heavily invested in equity securities or in debt or fixed income securities. The Fund will also, in certain situations, augment its investment positions by purchasing call options, both on specific equity securities, as well as securities representing exposure to equity sectors or indices and fixed income indices. Investments in non-U.S. markets will be made primarily through liquid securities, including depositary receipts (which evidence ownership in underlying foreign securities) and exchange traded funds.

Glossary of Financial Terms

Annualized Return
            Expressed as a percentage, annualized return calculates the return of a mutual fund or other investment over the period of an average year within a given duration. For example, an annualized ten year-return calculates the average annual return required to result in the 10-year cumulative return.
Asked or Offering Price 
            The price at which a mutual fund's shares can be purchased. The asked or offering price means the current net asset value (NAV) per share plus sales charge, if any. For a no-load fund, the asked price is the same as the NAV.
Basis Point 
            The smallest measure used for quoting yields on bonds and notes. One basis point is 0.01% of yield. So, if the Federal Reserve increases rates 50 basis points, or a bond's yield changes 50 basis points, that equates to 0.5% or 1/2 of 1%.
Capital Gains Distributions
            A taxable distribution paid to shareholders when any investments in their mutual fund's portfolio are sold at a profit. Realized Capital Gains are when stock or bond holdings are sold at a profit. Unrealized Capital Gains represent an increase in the market value of a mutual fund.
Closed-End Fund
            A fund with a fixed number of shares outstanding, and one which does not redeem shares the way a typical mutual fund does. Closed-end funds behave more like stock than open-end funds: closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares to the public in an initial public offering, after which time shares in the fund are bought and sold on a stock exchange, and they are not obligated to issue new shares or redeem outstanding shares as open-end funds are. The price of a share in a closed-end fund is determined entirely by market demand, so shares can either trade below their net asset value ("at a discount") or above it ("at a premium").
Distributions 
            The income or capital gain made by a mutual fund that is paid to the fund's investors.
Dividend Reinvestment 
            The option to reinvest cash dividends by purchasing additional shares or fractional shares on the dividend payment date.
Net Asset Value - (NAV)
            In the context of mutual funds, the total value of the fund's portfolio less liabilities. The NAV is usually calculated on a daily basis.
Prospectus
            A legal document that provides full disclosure of all information investors need to make a sound decision about an investment. Financial institutions file prospectuses with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Free cash flow yield
A ratio calculated by dividing a company's free cash flow by its market capitalization.
Price/Earnings Ratio 
Represents equity securities within the Fund's portfolio, and is not intended to demonstrate Fund growth, income earned by the Fund, or distributions made by the Fund.

Clough Global Opportunities Fund (AMEX:GLO)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



Statement Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act 
      of 1940

      On June 30, 2017, the Clough Global Opportunities Fund (NYSE MKT: GLO) 
      (the âFundâ), a closed-end fund, paid a monthly distribution on its 
      common stock of $0.0860 per share to shareholders of record at the close 
      of business on June 19, 2017.
    

      The following table sets forth the estimated amount of the sources of 
      distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 
      1940, as amended, and the related rules adopted thereunder. The Fund 
      estimates the following percentages, of the total distribution amount 
      per share, attributable to (i) current and prior fiscal year net 
      investment income, (ii) net realized short-term capital gain, (iii) net 
      realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return of capital or other 
      capital source as a percentage of the total distribution amount. These 
      percentages are disclosed for the current distribution as well as the 
      fiscal year-to-date cumulative distribution amount per share for the 
      Fund.

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) 
      Notice are only estimates and not for tax reporting purposes. The 
      actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes 
      will depend upon the Fundâs investment experience during the remainder 
      of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax 
      regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar 
      year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal 
      income tax purposes. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more 
      than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of 
      your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may 
      occur for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in 
      the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not 
      necessarily reflect the Fundâs investment performance and should not be 
      confused with âyieldâ or âincome.â


      Presented below are return figures, based on the change in the Fundâs 
      Net Asset Value per share (âNAVâ), compared to the annualized 
      distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the 
      NAV on the last business day of the month prior to distribution record 
      date.

Past performance is not indicative of future results.


      ^ Based on the Fundâs NAV as of May 31, 2017.
    

      * Cumulative fiscal year-to-date return is based on the change in NAV 
      including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of these 
      distributions for the period November 1, 2016 through May 31, 2017.
    

      ** The 5 year average annual total return is based on change in NAV 
      including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of these 
      distributions and is through the last business day of the month prior to 
      the month of the current distribution record date.
    

      While the NAV performance may be indicative of the Fundâs investment 
      performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholderâs investment 
      in the Fund. The value of a shareholderâs investment in the Fund is 
      determined by the Fundâs market price, which is based on the supply and 
      demand for the Fundâs shares in the open market. Shareholders should 
      not draw any conclusions about the Fundâs investment performance from 
      the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fundâs Managed 
      Distribution Plan.


      Furthermore, the Board of Trustees reviews the amount of any potential 
      distribution and the income, capital gain or capital available. The 
      Board of Trustees will continue to monitor the Fundâs distribution 
      level, taking into consideration the Fundâs net asset value and the 
      financial market environment. The Fundâs distribution policy is subject 
      to modification by the Board of Trustees at any time. The distribution 
      rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total return on an 
      investment in the Fund.
