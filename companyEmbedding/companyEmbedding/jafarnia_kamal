Feb 13 2015
Kamal Jafarnia Joins Carey Financial, LLC as General Counsel and CCO
W.P. Carey Inc. and Carey Financial, LLC announced today the hiring of Kamal Jafarnia as Senior Vice President serving as General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer. 
 As a securities attorney, Jafarnia’s resume touts two decades of experience working for broker-dealers, alternative investment sponsors, and international law firms serving the direct investment industry.
 In a letter welcoming Jafarnia, Jay Steigerwald, Executive Director of W.P. Carey Inc., noted, “Beyond his professional background as a lawyer and industry leader, one of the most rewarding and important aspects to his career is having developed significant and meaningful relationships with many of you.”





 
 Steigerwald added, “Additionally, his experience focusing on a vast array of investments products, including non-traded BDCs, non-traded REITs and registered funds, is a valuable resource to us all at Carey Financial.”
