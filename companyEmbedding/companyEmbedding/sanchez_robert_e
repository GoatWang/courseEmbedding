Robert E. Sanchez
Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer




Rob Bio



Robert E. Sanchez is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryder System, Inc., a Fortune 500 commercial fleet management and supply chain solutions company. He was named Chief Executive Officer in January 2013 and Chairman of the Board in May 2013.
Over the course of two decades at Ryder, Mr. Sanchez has held many senior executive leadership positions including President and Chief Operating Officer, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer, President of Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), Senior VP and Chief Information Officer, Senior VP of Transportation Management within Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) and VP Asset Management.  He has been a member of the company’s Executive Leadership Team since 2003. In his earlier roles, he played a key part in implementing the strategy to centralize Ryder’s asset management function and improve its cost management which drove an improvement in the return of capital and earnings of the company. Since 2012, he has led the development and execution of Ryder’s growth strategy focused on the large segment of businesses that do not yet outsource their fleet management and supply chain functions. Under his leadership, the company has achieved record revenue and earnings levels.
Mr. Sanchez is on the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments and chair of the board’s compensation committee. He also serves on the Board of Directors of the Truck Renting and Leasing Association (TRALA), the United Way of Miami-Dade, St. Thomas University in Miami, the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, and the Association of Cuban American Engineers (ACAE), for which he chairs the Scholarship Foundation.  Additionally, he is a member of the University of Miami President’s Council and the College of Engineering Visiting Committee. He is also a mentor for the Big Brothers Big Sisters School to Work Program.
In 2010, The South Florida Business Journal named Mr. Sanchez CFO of the Year for the South Florida region, recognizing the important role he and his team played in maintaining Ryder’s strong financial position during the difficult economic environment of 2009. In addition, he was named one of the Top 100 Power Leaders by The South Florida Business Journal in 2016.
Mr. Sanchez earned his MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania with a concentration in Finance and Strategic Management and a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Miami.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
