Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc:Citigroup will pay $23 mln to end private U.S. antitrust litigation claiming that it conspired to manipulate the yen Libor and Euroyen Tibor benchmark interest rates - RTRS.Lawyers for the plaintiff investors called the accord an "ice breaker" that could spur some of the roughly 20 other bank defendants to settle. Settlement papers were filed on Monday night in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Court approval is required - RTRS.RP Martin, a brokerage whose main assets are now part of BGC Partners Inc, also settled, without making a payment. Citigroup & RP Martin agreed to cooperate in the litigation - RTRS.Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said the New York-based bank is pleased to settle - RTRS.Among the other defendants are several Japanese banks, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, as well as Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG , HSBC Holdings, JPMorgan Chase & UBS AG - RTRS.Former Citigroup trader Tom Hayes is serving 11 years in prison after being found guilty in London last August of conspiring to rig Libor - RTRS.Nonetheless, the bank's "limited involvement" in the overall scheme may have spurred its settlement, the plaintiffs' lawyer Vincent Briganti said in an interview. - RTRS."An early settlement with Citigroup made sense." In court papers, Briganti called the accord an "ice breaker" that "serves as a potential catalyst for other defendants to settle." - RTRS.

Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (三井住友トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Torasuto Hōrudingusu Kabushiki Gaisha), formerly Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., is a Japanese financial holding company headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It provides an assortment of financial solutions and financial products to retail and wholesale customers, with a focus on asset management, financial brokerage and real estate services.[3]
Its main operating company is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (三井住友信託銀行株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Shintaku Ginkō Kabushiki Gaisha), which is the largest trust company and the fifth-largest bank in Japan measured by assets.
The company has no capital relationship with the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group; the two banking groups are similarly named because both are descended from the historical Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates.

History[edit]
Chuo Mitsui[edit]
SMT's earliest predecessor was The Mitsui Trust Company, Limited, established in March 1924 with capital of 30 million yen. In March 1948, it changed its name to The Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. It changed its name again to The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited in 1952.[4]
The Chuo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. was established in May 1962 with capital of 2.5 billion yen and support from Tokai Bank, Dai-Ichi Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. It took over Tokai and Dai-Ichi's trust businesses as well as the stock transfer agency business of Japan Securities Agents, Ltd. It acquired the Honshu operations of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1998.[4]
Mitsui Trust and Chuo Trust signed a merger agreement in May 1999 and completed their merger in April 2000, becoming The Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited (中央三井信託銀行株式会社). In 2001, Chuo Mitsui announced its plans to establish a new bank holding company known as Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., which was formed in February 2002. It changed its name to Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (中央三井トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社) in 2007.[4]
Sumitomo Trust[edit]
Sumitomo Trust Co., Ltd. was founded in July 1925 with capital of 20 million yen and its headquarters in Awajicho, Osaka. It changed its name to Fuji Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. in 1948 and adopted the name The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (住友信託銀行株式会社) in 1952. In 1962 it moved its headquarters to the Sumitomo Building in Kitahama, Osaka.[5]
Merger[edit]
Chuo Mitsui agreed to merge with The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. in November 2009, and formed a holding company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., by a share exchange between Chuo Mitsui and Sumitomo Trust in April 2011. The three main trust banks under this holding company merged in April 2012 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited.[4] SMTB became the largest trust bank in Japan and the fifth-largest commercial bank overall measured by assets.[6]
SMTB was fined for insider trading in 2012, after a Chuo Mitsui fund manager was found to have traded on information leaked from Nomura Securities regarding a 2010 share issuance by Mizuho Financial Group.[7]

Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (三井住友トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Torasuto Hōrudingusu Kabushiki Gaisha), formerly Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., is a Japanese financial holding company headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It provides an assortment of financial solutions and financial products to retail and wholesale customers, with a focus on asset management, financial brokerage and real estate services.[3]
Its main operating company is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (三井住友信託銀行株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Shintaku Ginkō Kabushiki Gaisha), which is the largest trust company and the fifth-largest bank in Japan measured by assets.
The company has no capital relationship with the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group; the two banking groups are similarly named because both are descended from the historical Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates.

History[edit]
Chuo Mitsui[edit]
SMT's earliest predecessor was The Mitsui Trust Company, Limited, established in March 1924 with capital of 30 million yen. In March 1948, it changed its name to The Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. It changed its name again to The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited in 1952.[4]
The Chuo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. was established in May 1962 with capital of 2.5 billion yen and support from Tokai Bank, Dai-Ichi Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. It took over Tokai and Dai-Ichi's trust businesses as well as the stock transfer agency business of Japan Securities Agents, Ltd. It acquired the Honshu operations of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1998.[4]
Mitsui Trust and Chuo Trust signed a merger agreement in May 1999 and completed their merger in April 2000, becoming The Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited (中央三井信託銀行株式会社). In 2001, Chuo Mitsui announced its plans to establish a new bank holding company known as Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., which was formed in February 2002. It changed its name to Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (中央三井トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社) in 2007.[4]
Sumitomo Trust[edit]
Sumitomo Trust Co., Ltd. was founded in July 1925 with capital of 20 million yen and its headquarters in Awajicho, Osaka. It changed its name to Fuji Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. in 1948 and adopted the name The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (住友信託銀行株式会社) in 1952. In 1962 it moved its headquarters to the Sumitomo Building in Kitahama, Osaka.[5]
Merger[edit]
Chuo Mitsui agreed to merge with The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. in November 2009, and formed a holding company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., by a share exchange between Chuo Mitsui and Sumitomo Trust in April 2011. The three main trust banks under this holding company merged in April 2012 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited.[4] SMTB became the largest trust bank in Japan and the fifth-largest commercial bank overall measured by assets.[6]
SMTB was fined for insider trading in 2012, after a Chuo Mitsui fund manager was found to have traded on information leaked from Nomura Securities regarding a 2010 share issuance by Mizuho Financial Group.[7]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

      To whom it may concern
    

      July 27, 2017
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (Securities Code: 8309 TSE, NSE) Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., Ltd.
    

      Notice regarding Basic Policy for the Split and Integration of Asset Management Functions
    

      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (President: Tetsuo Ohkubo) hereby announces that it has decided on the basic policy for the split of asset management functions from Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (President: Masaru Hashimoto, hereinafter "SuMi TRUST"), and the integration of aforementioned functions with the related Group company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., Ltd. (President: Hideki Hiraki, hereinafter "SuMi TRUST AM") (the "Business Split and Integration"), with the purpose of strengthening the asset management business, which is positioned as a growth business for the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group.
    

      Further, as a preparatory step for the Business Split and Integration, we will segregate as a business within the company, the asset management business of SuMi TRUST, which is to be the subject of the split and integration, and we will commence concrete initiatives, beginning with formulation of growth strategies.
    


          Background to the Business Split and Integration
        

          With the continued harsh asset management environment of low interest rates worldwide, and increasing price volatility in a wide-range of assets, etc., for clients of all sizes, from individuals and corporations to institutional investors, there are increasing expectations on asset management companies to provide stable and high-quality investment returns, and the provision of products that contribute to future asset-formation primarily through medium- to long-term investment has become an important social mission for asset management companies.
        

          In addition, as a further social mission, asset management companies are urged to contribute to Japan's economic growth through sophistication of the investment chain, by providing growth capital through asset management products and making sustainable improvements to corporate value through constructive dialogue.
        

          In order to meet these expectations, SuMi TRUST, which has been providing services for corporate and institutional investors for many years, will split its asset management functions, which
        

          feature high-level know-how and quality, and strategically integrate aforementioned functions with SuMi TRUST AM, which has been aiming to expand its business from individual investors, focusing on defined contribution pensions, fund wraps, and index trusts, etc. We aim to concentrate and proactively allocate our management resources to growth areas.
        



          Vision for the New Company
        

          As a new asset management company that boasts of being among the largest in scale in Japan, the new company will focus on development of asset management products that will allow clients to entrust, with peace of mind, their medium- to long-term asset formation, and will aim to be an asset management company that has nationally well-known brand power, with recognition from many clients that "SuMi TRUST AM is the most reliable partner in medium- to long-term investment".
        

          The new company will aim to thoroughly strengthen its asset management capabilities, and it will be equipped with an extensive line-up that is responsive to the broad-range of investor needs, and will pursue the maximization of client profits by responding swiftly to the various client needs.
        

          Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group, as a financial group specialized in trust banking, has as its management philosophy, the fulfillment of "trustee's responsibilities" - which are the origin of fiduciary duties. In this specific matter of the split and integration of the asset management business, in order to contribute to business conduct that is still more thoroughly client-oriented, and the improvement of management independence and transparency, the new company intends to continue to enhance its corporate governance framework through measures such as, for example, actively inviting external experts with high-level knowledge to serve as independent external directors.
        



          Schedule for the Business Split and Integration
        


      For the Business Split and Integration, we will, effective on August 1, 2017, implement business segregation within the company regarding the asset management operations relating to the fiduciary services business of SuMi TRUST, which is to be the subject of the integration, and we will commence concrete preparations.
    

      Based on detailed review and discussions, and subject to matters such as necessary resolutions of the board of directors and the shareholder of each company, and filings with the relevant Japanese and overseas authorities, and approvals, we will aim for integration during Fiscal Year 2018.

Its main operating company is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (三井住友信託銀行株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Shintaku Ginkō Kabushiki Gaisha), which is the largest trust company and the fifth-largest bank in Japan measured by assets.
The company has no capital relationship with the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group; the two banking groups are similarly named because both are descended from the historical Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates.

History[edit]
Chuo Mitsui[edit]
SMT's earliest predecessor was The Mitsui Trust Company, Limited, established in March 1924 with capital of 30 million yen. In March 1948, it changed its name to The Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. It changed its name again to The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited in 1952.[4]
The Chuo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. was established in May 1962 with capital of 2.5 billion yen and support from Tokai Bank, Dai-Ichi Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. It took over Tokai and Dai-Ichi's trust businesses as well as the stock transfer agency business of Japan Securities Agents, Ltd. It acquired the Honshu operations of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1998.[4]
Mitsui Trust and Chuo Trust signed a merger agreement in May 1999 and completed their merger in April 2000, becoming The Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited (中央三井信託銀行株式会社). In 2001, Chuo Mitsui announced its plans to establish a new bank holding company known as Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., which was formed in February 2002. It changed its name to Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (中央三井トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社) in 2007.[4]
Sumitomo Trust[edit]
Sumitomo Trust Co., Ltd. was founded in July 1925 with capital of 20 million yen and its headquarters in Awajicho, Osaka. It changed its name to Fuji Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. in 1948 and adopted the name The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (住友信託銀行株式会社) in 1952. In 1962 it moved its headquarters to the Sumitomo Building in Kitahama, Osaka.[5]
Merger[edit]
Chuo Mitsui agreed to merge with The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. in November 2009, and formed a holding company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., by a share exchange between Chuo Mitsui and Sumitomo Trust in April 2011. The three main trust banks under this holding company merged in April 2012 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited.[4] SMTB became the largest trust bank in Japan and the fifth-largest commercial bank overall measured by assets.[6]
SMTB was fined for insider trading in 2012, after a Chuo Mitsui fund manager was found to have traded on information leaked from Nomura Securities regarding a 2010 share issuance by Mizuho Financial Group.[7]

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line.
