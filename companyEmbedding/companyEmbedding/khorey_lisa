In 2012, UPMC embarked on a five-year, $100 million investment in a major analytics effort to make more information available more readily throughout the organization.
Leading the effort’s technology component is Lisa Khorey, vice president, enterprise systems and data management at UPMC.

“The organization is committed,” Khorey said of UPMC. “It really is the icing on the cake of an IT investment that’s been made over the past 10 years.”
Khorey began her UPMC career in 1995 as a financial systems programmer and later transitioned to systems administration. She spent two years as chief information officer at South Side and Braddock hospitals, which recently had been acquired by UPMC.




In her current role, she leads a team that is responsible for integration of UPMC’s extensive electronic medical records, data governance, enterprise data quality and development of advanced analytics.
The goal is to draw from the organization’s vast compilation of data to provide easily accessible information in an effort to improve the care of patients.

Education: B.S., library and information science, University of Pittsburgh; MBA, Duquesne University

Who makes the best kind of mentor?
“The best mentors are people who come together because they share something, and the mentor has some experience diverse from the mentee. The best mentor relationships come about naturally around that shared goal.”

Harry Funk is a freelance writer.

 Thinking Really Big About Data: UPMC’s Lisa Khorey Talks About What’s Behind the Organization’s Groundbreaking Five-Year Initiative

Lisa Khorey shares her perspectives on UPMC’s five-year, $100 million enterprise analytics initiativeOn October 1, the 20-plus-hospital University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) health system announced a new five-year, $100 million enterprise healthcare analytics initiative to foster personalized medicine and other core strategic healthcare IT goals for the organization, partnering with several prominent vendors—Oracle, IBM, Informatica, and dbMotion.
In a press release made public on that date, the UPMC organization noted that “UPMC today announced that it intends to create a best-in-class data warehouse that brings together clinical, financial, administrative, genomic and other information that today is difficult to integrate and analyze.” The press release also included this quote from Steven D. Shapiro, M.D., UPMC’s chief medical and scientific officer: “Every patient is different; every patient has a unique story. This comprehensive analytics approach will enable us to treat each patient in a personalized way, to produce the best possible results.”
Shortly after the announcement of the initiative, HCI Editor-in-Chief Mark Hagland interviewed Lisa Khorey, vice president of enterprise systems and data management, regarding the initiative’s importance and its implications for the U.S. healthcare system. Below are excerpts from that interview.
What was the origin of this initiative, and what are UPMC’s  strategic goals in all this?
The organization aims to really bring together new models of care, based on good science and smart technology. You can look at it as a triangle, with all three elements feeding each other. And that model really works for us, because we have a very integrated organization, where we’re trying to improve quality, decrease cost, etc. We’re an integrated provider-payer system with close academic ties, and a culture of innovation. And it’s one where these goals are very present every day in our organization. So it forces an awareness of how we might be able to solve these problems.
The Center for Innovative Science, which will open in 2014, is our operational approach to good science and innovative models of care. And one of the questions we want to ask through the center is, how do we better understand medicine? So the center will basically focus on personalized medicine and on cancer and aging.
Lisa Khorey
Meanwhile, as we’ve moved forward as an organization, we have a “happy” information management problem, in that we spent ten years becoming very digital, creating a truly digital environment. And that’s terrific, but the number of vendors that it takes to solve the problem of care delivery through electronic systems requires so many participants that you end up with siloed data. Medicine is very complex in itself, and as a business, it’s very complex as well. So the consumer data set, the business data set, and the clinical data set, those are all separate sets.
And our enterprise program and agenda are about putting data to work, becoming much more actionable, being able to qualitatively measure, and to use sophisticated software and data models, to support the science agenda and the emerging models of care, and really to sum up, to become more precise in our delivery of care, which includes reducing variation. In brief, what needs to be done is to elevate relevant information and make it more available to end-users. It’s not unlike what has happened in every other industry; the challenge for medicine is that it’s the most complex data set anywhere. Our aim through this program and investment and the banner of personalized medicine, is to take all that information and data and the business problems and the information management agenda, and to put them all together, and to bring that information to life to improve patient outcomes.
Our goals are so simple; they’re as simple as a doctor talking to a patient. We want to elevate that experience to be as accurate and positive an experience as possible, and to improve the outcomes of every such encounter. So, why UPMC, why this effort? When we positioned it inside the organization and started to transform our organization to bring the different areas together—research, corporate finance, the whole provider division, and our health plan—then we looked over what we had done for the past ten years. And our investment in information technology and electronic medical records over the last decade really put us on a track to come together holistically to solve this problem together across all the lines of business; and then there’s just our science agenda, which is raising the bar on patient care. That’s why this is happening in this particular organization right now.
Might this add another layer of complexity, or will it simplify things?Pages1
