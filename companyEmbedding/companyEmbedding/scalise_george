George Scalise was the former president of the Building Service Employees International Union (BSEIU) who was convicted of racketeering due to the exposure of labor racketeering by newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1941 for his reporting.[1]
The BSEIU (known as the Service Employees International Union since 1968) was founded in 1921 in Chicago to represent janitors, elevator operators, and window washers. Membership increased significantly with a 1934 strike in New York City's Garment District.
Scalise, who rose to head the union due to his connections with organized crime, was indicted by New York District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey, charged with extorting $100,000 from employers over three years. Convicted of labor racketeering, Scalise was sentenced to 10–20 years in prison.[2]
Organized crime infiltration of BSEIU[edit]
Scalise succeeded Jerry Horan, the corrupt head of the union, as president in 1937. Under Horan's presidency, the union's ties to the Chicago Outfit deepened. In 1933, Horan was accused by former Illinois Attorney General Edward J. Brundage of consorting with gangster Al Capone and seeking to improperly influence James H. Wilkerson, the judge overseeing Capone's 1931 tax evasion trial.[3]
Horan, however, initially attempted to avoid being put under the influence of Capone and his Chicago Outfit. Capone sought control BSEIU in order to embezzle funds from the national union's treasury.[2][4] But Big Tim Murphy had been gunned down in 1928,[5] leaving Horan without protection. Horan could not turn to Chicago Mayor Bill Thompson, either, for Thompson was closely linked to the Capone mob.[2][4] In March 1931, an intimidated Horan made peace with Capone. By 1933, Horan was taking his orders from Murray "The Camel" Humphreys, Capone's liaison to unions.[6]
In 1934, the Capone mob forced Horan to hire George Scalise as a union organizer. Scalise, a 38-year-old from New York City, had been involved in interstate prostitution, labor racketeering and other organized crime activities since the early 1920s. A protégé of Anthony "Little Augie Pisano" Carfano,[7][8][9] a former Capone associate who had moved to New York City and joined what was then known as the Luciano crime family,[10] Scalise had used his mob connections to establish several small union locals with the Teamsters.[11] With Carfano's help, he then built several large locals of building janitors and elevator operators, began skimming members' dues and receiving kickbacks from employers, and then affiliated the locals with the BSEIU.[2][11] In 1934, Scalise asked Carfano to use his Chicago Outfit connections to help Scalise become the Eastern Representative for BSEIU, a position which put him in control of all BSEIU locals on the East Coast.[9] Horan agreed to the deal, and Scalise was not only appointed to the position but Scalise also received 50 percent of the dues from any newly organized members in the East.[2][6][7][8][9][12][13][14] In 1935, when the Fifth Vice President position on the BSEIU Board of Directors opened up due to a retirement, Scalise worked with Carfano and Horan to win appointment to the position.[9]
Because of Horan's mob connections, BSEIU grew tremendously during Horan's presidency. The mob received more money the more union members there were, so there was every incentive to bring in new members. Mob enforcers intimidated employers into permitting unionization of their employees, and existing locals swelled with members while new locals proliferated. BSEIU grew from 10,000 members in 1932 to 40,000 members in 1936 and 75,000 members in 1939.[15]

George Scalise



 Interview 
  with George Scalise
  April 3, 2003
  Los Altos Hills, California
 
RW: George Scalise, President of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the 
  SIA, has a distinguished thirty-year industry career. He has worked in senior 
  positions at Motorola, Fairchild, AMD, Apple, and MacStore. In the 2003 interview, 
  George discusses the early days of semiconductors and the issues of Japanese 
  DRAM dumping. Well George, tell me about your parents and your family.
GS: Well, my parents come from Italy. My father was born there and came over 
  here when he was, I guess late teens, early 20's. My mother, all of her family 
  was born in the same area, in the south of Italy in Calabria and she was the 
  only one that was born right after they came over here. It turns out my dad 
  started as a gardener at the Cornell University and then came down into Pennsylvania, 
  worked on the railroad and then got into the steel working industry and spent 
  the rest of his career there. Wonderful parents, very interested in having all 
  their children have the benefits that they didn't have, clearly having never 
  gotten beyond seventh or eighth grade in school and it turns out that of the 
  six children that we had in the family then four of us went through college, 
  two of them did not. Well my sister really went to a business school, so I guess 
  in a sense you could say that she did as well. So, it was a success story for 
  them and I think they achieved a great deal as far as they were concerned and 
  had a good time doing it. 
RW: So where did you fit in as the children?
GS: I was the fifth of the six children. I was the fifth boy and then my sister 
  was born following me. So, it was a wonderful family. We all played a lot of 
  sports as you did in those little steel towns in western Pennsylvania where 
  I grew up. It was a time I think that where those of us that grew up during 
  that period were very fortunate in that there were a lot of things to do and 
  yet the community, the sense of community was so great that you had a chance 
  to really grow up, learn about life, live life, and do it in an environment 
  that allowed for I guess the small mistakes to be made and for that to not be 
  very much of an issue and you learned from it and you went on to the next level. 
  So it was just a wonderful time to grow up and enjoyed it a great deal. 
RW: So how about schooling?
GS: Well, yeah I went to school there in Warren, Pennsylvania where I grew 
  up. I worked all the time, I mean I think from the time I was eight years old, 
  I either had a paper route or I worked in a fruit store or I became a baker 
  actually when I was in junior high school and high school and I would work at 
  night. On the weekends I would start at four o'clock in the morning and I would 
  work as a baker until about noon time and then I would, was a scrub boy the 
  rest of the day and did all the pots and pans and cleaned the bake shop up so 
  that it was ready for the next day's work. As I was going through school, you 
  began to think about what it is that you were going to do with your life and 
  how it was all going to work out. And it became very clear to me that engineering 
  was a very good way to make a living and to do some things that would be of 
  interest. And I was good in math and science so I thought well that's what I'm 
  going to go do, I'll go become an engineer. And I did, I went on to Purdue University. 
  Turns out my brother, older brother, one of my older brothers, had gone to Purdue, 
  not as an engineer but in the business and economic school there. And given 
  that it had a very good reputation as an engineering school, I thought well 
  that's a good place to go. So, that's where I went and spent four years there 
  again working all the way through in a clothing store and various places, making 
  enough money so you could keep things going and make ends meet and get through 
  school in four years. And it worked out really well. Got a degree in mechanical 
  engineering of all things and again I selected mechanical engineering primarily 
  because as I was going through the process of selection, I asked which school 
  had the most job opportunities because I was most interested in getting a job 
  and doing something that would make for a better life. And I was told mechanical 
  engineering was the best. So I thought well then, I will go and become a mechanical 
  engineer. But I think, as you know, as we went through our careers, why the 
  basic engineering was really just a learning experience that helped you to solve 
  problems as I look at it. When I give lectures at universities today, I talk 
  about that the engineering training is really a problem solving training and 
  then all of the disciplines you get and whatever one you focused on is a good 
  foundation, but in reality why you can become any kind of engineer as time goes 
  on. I think most of us did. We became semiconductor engineers, electronic engineers. 
  We had to, well again, going back to the earliest days of the industry as you 
  recall, we had to do everything. We didn't have an equipment industry, we didn't 
  have the infrastructure, so we were not only developing processes and products, 
  but we were also designing and building equipment that allowed us to make all 
  of our products, whether it was a furnace or a crystal puller or a welding system, 
  it didn't matter, we were designing and building everything at that time, so 
  you became a pretty good engineer over time and you had a lot of experience 
  in a lot of different disciplines. 
RW: So when did you graduate?
GS: I graduated from Purdue in 1956 and immediately went to work in the television 
  industry as I came out of school. Television was a pretty good place to be at 
  that time. I figured that was a growing industry, a good place to go and get 
  involved right away. But at that stage, there was a lull in the demand for young 
  men to go into the service at that point and yet you still had to go take your 
  physical. And I got my call to go take a physical within a month of the time 
  I got out of school and while I was in Philadelphia taking the physical, I decided 
  I think I should just volunteer for the draft and go into the Army for a couple 
  of years and do what my brothers had done. All four of my brothers had gone 
  into the military. They were all in the Navy it turns out, but I decided to 
  volunteer so I went into the Army and became, actually an engineer in the Army 
  of all things making chemical weapons at the Army chemical center is Edgewood, 
  Maryland and got very much involved in that whole process and realized just 
  how difficult and terrible this stuff is. And finally why I got to the point 
  where I was not only making the chemical weapons, but white phosphorous and 
  all kinds of things. So it was really quite an experience in dealing with emissions 
  that we never heard of or thought about before and thankfully were never used. 
  They were always kept as a defensive mechanism and stored away and I think they've 
  all been destroyed by now. But it was quite a period there. 
RW: So you were in the weapons of mass destructive biz? 
GS: Well I guess given today's terminology, that's where we were at that time, 
  yeah. It's kind of interesting that because it was so much a part of the business 
  at that point of military, although I'm quite certain that U.S. has never, never 
  used any of those weapons either before that time or since that time. It was 
  always a defensive mechanism and so it was, but it was one of things that they 
  did have as a part of the defensive arsenal for sure. 
RW: So then what did you do?
GS: Well when I came out of the Army in 1958, it was at the time that semiconductors 
  were really just beginning to get underway and I went to Massachusetts and if 
  you recall at that stage, why the semiconductor industry was really centered 
  in the Northeast. All of the old tube companies, RCA and GE and Philco and Tungsal 
  and the whole bunch of them were all in the semiconductor business mostly making 
  power transistors at that time. A few of them had some LA diffused devises, 
  but not too many for switching and things. So I went to work for, actually CBS 
  electronics, the Columbia Broadcasting had gotten into the tube business during 
  the war and then branched out into semiconductors as it began to emerge. So 
  we had an operation in Lowell, Massachusetts in an old mill building. You know, 
  again, there was no air conditioning. In the summer you had the windows open 
  so it was a pretty dusty environment, but, you know, at that stage why you could 
  still make semiconductors reasonably well because of the kind of processes we 
  were using and the size of the junctions and all those things, contamination 
  was a problem, but it wasn't devastating like it is today in the clean rooms 
  that we have to have available to us to build our products of today. It's kind 
  of interesting when you think about the contrasts of what that work environment 
  was like and then you think about the clean rooms that we have today. It's one 
  of the many contrasts I think that are so vivid in the history of this industry. 
  You can, you know, you can take that same thing and you go to the first germanium 
  mesa wafers before we became focused on silicon entirely and germanium largely 
  went away. I think that our first wafers were half inch if I recall. I think 
  that's what they were. And now you think about, we're now producing on twelve 
  inch wafers and the geometries and that stage, well we didn't think about geometries 
  so much in terms, we were just really figuring out how to get that junction 
  to work and then doing the alloy diffusion and so on. But, and thinking now 
  today, why we have all of these clean room environments, we can do, today I 
  guess we're putting about two hundred and fifty million transistors on a chip 
  and before the end of the decade, as you well know, they're going to be over 
  a billion transitions on that same piece of real estate. So it's just remarkable 
  the contrast from the early days when we were getting started to what we're 
  able to do today.
RW: Yeah, one to a billion. 
GS: One to a billion. 
RW: Quite a contrast. 
GS: And in fact, I'm sure the billion will be on a piece of real estate smaller, 
  smaller than that, even the diodes that we were making at that time. In fact, 
  I kind of kid about how we were making diodes with a hammer at that stage because 
  before we had the glass encapsulation process, we did the, we made a diode with 
  a plastic sleeve and we would solder the die with the PN junction on it on to 
  one post and then we would put an S bend and we would weld it to the other post. 
  We would shove them into the sleeve of plastic and then we would connect it 
  to a curve tray, so we would tap it until we got the right forward characteristic 
  then we'd stop and we had our diode. Well clearly when the temperature changed 
  or someone bumped it, why it was going to have slightly different characteristics, 
  but that was the best diode we could make at that stage before we got to the 
  glass encapsulation process and all that followed that. 
RW: Amazing, so how long did you stay with CBS?
GS: I was with CBS for three years and then they realized that that really 
  wasn't their kind of business. They were really a broadcasting company and records, 
  they were very successful in records at that time and that the electronics world 
  and the investment that was involved in the research and development funding 
  that was necessary, all of those things really were not a part of the culture 
  of that company. And so they decided to get out of the business and, you know, 
  it's like so many things in life as you look back there are some critical turning 
  points, and this was one for me because I was doing my MBA at night at Boston 
  University at that time and I was about half way through getting my degree and 
  decided that well there was six of us of the, maybe there were four hundred 
  in the whole organization at the time, that were selected to stay and go with 
  Raytheon who was buying this operation out away from CBS. And so over a three-month 
  period we were kind of shutting this thing down and getting ready for the transition 
  over to Raytheon. And I said on the last day that it was still CBS, Monday it 
  was going to be Raytheon, I was leaving the office at about four o'clock and 
  said I'm going to go home, I got to get ready, I want to get back here on Monday, 
  we got to get something going here. And as I was walking in my apartment, the 
  phone was ringing. Now it turns out I would never go home at four o'clock, it 
  was always five thirty, six, seven o'clock, but this one Friday, the phone was 
  ringing and it was a guy by the name of Harry Knowles from Motorola who was 
  in charge of research and development there and he had heard about me and he 
  wanted me to come out for an interview. And I said Harry, you know, I've been 
  shutting this place down for three months, I got to get back to work, I don't 
  want to waste any more time. He said, if I get you out here tonight, will you 
  come? And I said yeah, if you can get me out there tonight, I'll come. So, hang 
  up, the phone rang in another few minutes, you're on a plane at five thirty 
  or whatever the time was, and so I ran down to the airport, Logan airport, got 
  on the plane, next thing I knew I was out in Phoenix, Arizona, out in the middle 
  of the desert. And Motorola was just moving from the power transistors and the 
  early alloy diffused devices into germanium mesa and Harry was a guy that came 
  out of Bell Labs and did a lot of the original work on the germanium mesa and 
  he headed that group up as well as research and development. So we went into 
  the factory and we just talked and walked and we spent until four o'clock in 
  the morning just going over everything that was going on there and it was really 
  exciting. And so I went back to the motel, slept for a few hours and we were 
  meeting again about ten o'clock in morning. Got together, decided this had to 
  be the place to be. I mean I just, there was no way that I was going to find 
  the excitement and the challenge and the opportunity at Raytheon that I was 
  going to see here at Motorola. So by noontime, we made a deal, I flew back home, 
  picked up what few things I had and was back to work on Tuesday in Phoenix at 
  Motorola. And I think that transition, that particular opportunity coming when 
  it did was critical to the rest of my career. 
RW: Well how about that?
GS: Yeah, it's just one of those things that, you know, had I not gone home 
  that day at that time, you didn't have an answering system, so you never would 
  have gotten the phone call, and chances are come Monday, I was going to be working 
  and I wouldn't have been tempted at that stage because I was onto my next challenge. 
  But it worked out. 
RW: So what did you do at Motorola? 
GS: Well I went into the R and D area and at first Harry was a wonderful engineer, 
  just a brilliant engineer, not one of the better managers around. And so my 
  first task was to go to work with him and to help get the R&D effort really 
  organized because we wanted to get our integrated circuit operation really into 
  a solid development program and then bring it out into manufacturing. So once 
  I got the whole R&D effort organized and running well, then I took over 
  the task of running the integrated circuit operation in the assembly and test 
  site. We had a couple of other guys that were doing all of the front end work 
  at that point, so I took over the assembly and test part of it and together 
  we began to develop the integrated circuit operation at Motorola. And once we 
  put the whole thing together, then I took it from research and development out 
  into production and actually put the first meckle circuits together at Motorola 
  back in, gosh I would guess that must have been about '63 or '64, I've kind 
  of lost track now, but it was around that time anyway. 
RW: So these were digital circuits? 
GS: Yes. Yeah, yeah, the old emitter couple logic. You know, the emitter couple 
  logic really came out of that period, although it never gained much momentum 
  as you well know until much later T squared L came out in, well first we had 
  the DTL and the RTL and all of that earlier, and then we came out with the emitter 
  couple logic, which was much faster and lower power, but most systems really 
  weren't ready for it yet and then T squared really took over for quite a while 
  and then emitter couple came back in later and has had an important role since 
  that time. But it was really kind of interesting going through that whole process 
  because again, you've developing all of the process technology. Early on you 
  were trying to figure out how to make hybrid circuits and then once the planar 
  technology began to evolve, then we realized that we could follow the lead of 
  Bob Noyce and the guys that developed the integrated circuit technology here 
  at Fairchild. So we were right on that path following them. 
RW: Well now who else was at Motorola? Was Hogan there?
GS: Hogan was there when I got there, yeah. And he was there throughout the 
  entire time I was there. Guys that you know well, Wilf Corrigan was there. Wilf 
  ran the transistor, silicon transistor operation. We had a germanium transistor 
  operation as well, but Wilf had the silicon transistor operation at that time. 
  I think he also may have run materials at one stage. I think he might have, 
  I've forgotten now, but I know he was involved with the wafer production because 
  again we had our own crystal pullers and all of that at that stage making all 
  of our own wafers. And then beyond that, why there were guys like John Welty, 
  Leo Dwark, Tom Hinkelman, Bill Laner was the equipment guy. Bill was a marvelous 
  equipment engineer and did a lot of work on developing a lot of the high speed 
  bonding equipment and things of that nature. He was quite remarkable in his 
  ability to, you know, see a problem and be able to design, build a machine that 
  was going to do the job very, very cost effectively with good quality, good 
  reliability. So it was really quite a team that we had there. 
RW: Motorola was a leader in automation.
GS: Oh yeah -
RW: Manufacturing.
GS: We were really good. We were really good. In fact, the old TL92, which 
  I'm sure is still in production, when we put those lines together, as you may 
  recall, the old globtop transistor that was being done at Fairchild first of 
  all didn't have the quality and reliability we had, but it didn't have anything 
  resembling our cost structure. We had just phenomenal manufacturing capability, 
  low cost, high quality, very reliable and, yeah, we just went on from there. 
  And then we took that same technology and modified it to build our integrated 
  circuits as well as we got into the old, well the original packaging techniques 
  with the lead frames and the ceramic and all the things we had to do at that 
  stage. 
RW: Well Fairchild took a different tact and went overseas, low-cost labor. 

GS: Well, yeah, that's right. It was really interesting. That's a very good 
  point Rob because Les Hogan and I, well first of all, going back, Western Electric 
  as you well know was the genesis of an awful lot of our technology and the licensing 
  arrangement was very, very gracious and we were able to take advantage of that 
  technology at very low cost. They had announced a stitch bonder technology that 
  was going to allow us to stitch bond the dye to the lead frames and Les Hogan 
  and I were back East looking at this equipment at Western Electric when we read 
  in the paper about Fairchild going to Hong Kong at that stage. And I remember 
  us having this conversation. Geez, you know, are they going to really beat us 
  in cost, should we go over there now, what should we do? And we talked about 
  it at some length and finally what we concluded was no we aren't going to go 
  over there now. What we better do is we'll take this technology that we see 
  here today, we'll modify it, we'll improve on it, we'll make it very cost effective, 
  very reliable, and then once we get to that point, we'll take that overseas 
  and then we'll have the best capability of anyone. And we did. So we didn't 
  go to Hong Kong, we went to Korea. We did that in 1967 and sure enough, we had 
  by far the best cost structure, the best capability as far as manufacturing 
  concerns and it really gave us a huge advantage in the competitive marketplace 
  out there. So it was really, it was an important decision as far as we were 
  concerned in making that move at that point because our feeling was if we got 
  over there and we didn't have to do all the work to develop this equipment and 
  the process technology and all, we weren't going to do it. We had the cost structure, 
  why bother, we're competitive. This just gave us a huge margin in our favor. 

RW: Well, did Hogan then go to Fairchild? 
GS: Well what happened was I went to Europe. I went over to take over our European 
  operation in '68 and it was while I was over there that Les got this opportunity 
  to go to Fairchild. It was in August of '68. And again, I had been very close 
  friends with him, worked with him for seven or eight years at this stage. And 
  when he decided to go, I decided that that had to be another good challenge 
  to go and see what we could do with the Fairchild operation, given that it had 
  a lot of good process technology and capabilities that I think genuinely was 
  ahead of us. We were better at manufacturing by far I think but as far as process 
  technology and product technology, they were probably ahead of us. So that was 
  in August of '68 and so I came from, we were living in Geneva, Switzerland at 
  time and we came back here to California. Now it's interesting because I haven't 
  made a lot of moves in my career geographically, so as I went from Massachusetts 
  to Phoenix and then over to Geneva, Switzerland, then we came here and you know 
  we lived over the other hill just across the way here for the first year while 
  we built this home and we've lived in this home ever since. So our children 
  all grew up here and it's been our home now thirty-four years, thirty-five years. 

RW: That's great. Well now were you recruited to Fairchild or did you volunteer?
GS: I really volunteered. I really volunteered because I just saw the challenge. 
  I saw the opportunity that was unique. Again I think it's one of those things 
  that's really fortunate that, it was one of those things you just said, that 
  has to be a really opportunity because again as I said, they had something that 
  we didn't have I felt, process technology and all that. And by that time I think 
  it was also becoming clear, although we were by that stage, if we weren't number 
  one in the country, we were very close. TI was very much larger than us when 
  I first got there, but we gained ground on TI very quickly and on Fairchild 
  as well and especially once the team left Fairchild, why we at that stage, were 
  going for about two hundred and fifty million dollars a year, which was a very 
  big semiconductor operation at that point. And I think in '68, we either were 
  equal to or just past TI and Fairchild was quite a bit smaller than us at that 
  state. I think they were maybe hundred and seventy five, hundred eighty million 
  dollars, something in that range. 
RW: Well there was a lawsuit from Motorola, what were the merits on that case?
GS: I don't think there were any merits. It turned out that we won the case, 
  although it took five years for it to go through the courts. And again, I think 
  it was one of those things that it was so important to work your way through 
  and get it behind you. I remember, as Dot and I and our three children got on 
  the plane to come back from Geneva to start here in California, the Herald Tribune, 
  you know, the International Herald Tribune, which has been the paper of international 
  travelers for many, many years, picked it up at the airport and there was an 
  article in the business page saying, I think it said seven semiconductor executives 
  sued by Motorola or something to that effect. And I remember showing it to Dot 
  and I said well honey, this is what we're going home to. And certainly it was 
  upsetting because it wasn't what you expected to have happen and all of a sudden, 
  you were looking forward to something and now you had to deal with this as well. 
  And it wasn't commonplace at that stage for lawsuits of this kind, so it was 
  a very, very unique thing to have happen. But again I give Les a lot of credit, 
  I give Sherman Fairchild a lot of credit because Sherman was a very strong and 
  honest and supportive guy and he said hey we've done nothing wrong, we'll just 
  fight this thing and we're going to win because, you know, the facts are going 
  to be on our side. And that's what we did. We went through the process for five 
  years and we won on every count so that it was a case where it just didn't merit 
  the litigation that did take place, but it was a very interesting and challenging 
  time to go through. I think once we got through the first two or three weeks 
  where you knew that there was not going to be an injunction that would prevent 
  you from working, which was our great concern, once we got that behind us and 
  we got that ruling, then we just put our heads down and went to work. 
RW: What did you find when you got to Fairchild? 
GS: Well first of all, you know, there was still a lot of really good capable 
  people there, that's the one thing. You could also then say that there were 
  a lot of very good capable people that had left. And so there were a lot of 
  gaps, but I think what I found more than anything else, it was the need for 
  improving the management and the business structure and that side of it. And 
  that's the part of the job I was given to really, I had finance, I had all the 
  administrative side of the business to get that organized and the other guys 
  went to work, you know, Wilf and Gene Blanchett and some of the others, went 
  to work in the product areas to make sure that we took advantage of all of those 
  strengths that were there. And so I think that it was a lot what I expected 
  it to be with the exception of the business side, I think it had a lot of work 
  to be done then maybe that was because so many folks that had left had left 
  a lot of holes in the organization. But I was always one to think in terms of 
  how good things were and not how bad things were. And if I could think in terms 
  of how good things were, I could build on that and make something good come 
  out of it and I think we did a pretty good job of that. 
RW: Between Fairchild and Motorola, the Wagon Wheel, the Jerry Sanders - that 
  was different, wasn't it?
GS: Yeah, culturally it truly was very different, there's no question about 
  it. Going back to Motorola and Phoenix, it was a very benign culture in many 
  ways where it was more of a classic pattern, although there was a bar across 
  from where the Motorola headquarters was there, but it wasn't a place that had 
  the kind of atmosphere and all that went along with the Wagon Wheel. There wasn't 
  anything that resembled the Wagon Wheel at that stage as far as Motorola was 
  concerned. So yeah, that was a big change, that was a very big change. 
RW: Well all the competitors were there and Motorola was kind of a one - company 
  town.
GS: We were on an island by ourselves down there, that's right, so we didn't 
  have the competition, we didn't have a lot of that switching back and forth 
  of engineers. No, there was none of that. It was very, very different. And I 
  think that it was something we had to adjust to, but I don't think that it made 
  a great difference in terms of how we operated and what you did. I'm a great 
  believer that people are people and as long as you treat them well and you try 
  to understand what it is that they're doing and you try and communicate what 
  it is that you need to get done and you work together, most folks are pretty 
  good to work with and I found the same thing here. So there may have been a 
  little bit of a cultural thing, but it wasn't anything you couldn't overcome. 

RW: What did you think of Jerry Sanders when you first met him?
GS: Well, you know, Jerry, I had known of him, although he was not at Fairchild 
  while, he was not at Motorola while I was there. I think he might have been 
  a salesman in the field for a short time because I arrived there in '61. And 
  I think he might have left just ahead of that, but I was aware of Jerry. And 
  I, as I've always said, the thing that impressed me about Jerry from the first 
  time and still does today is how smart the guy is. Yes, he's very colorful, 
  there's no question, but he's also, he's very articulate, he's very caring, 
  he's one of these people that you can trust. I mean, he is someone that I would 
  trust with anything because that's the kind of guy he is. He's a marvelous, 
  marvelous individual. And to me, that came across rather quickly. And, yeah 
  the fact he was colorful that just added another dimension to what was clearly 
  a truly outstanding capable guy. 
RW: But Les Hogan fired him.
GS: Well, they somehow didn't quite hit it off the way they could have and 
  should have and probably made a difference to Fairchild as a consequence of 
  Jerry not being there. But, you know, those are decisions that get made along 
  the way and sometimes people make decisions that they go back and look at and 
  say, well why did I do that? That probably was not the better decision of the 
  options that were available to me. I would consider that to be one of those. 

RW: So as you continued at Fairchild, what was happening?
GS: Well at that stage, we were going through the getting things back on track 
  as far as the operation. Again, we focused on the management side and the automation 
  side. We did a lot of that work. Bill Laner did come here as well and did take 
  over the equipment development manufacturing side of things. And that worked 
  out I think quite well. Now, I know that as we moved along, why there was a 
  lot of change that took place because of the valley and I think that, going 
  back to your question of a minute ago, might have had an impact that maybe we 
  weren't as well equipped or prepared to deal with the amount of change that 
  took place because of all the competitors around and things didn't fit together, 
  stay together, as well as they did down in Phoenix because we didn't have that 
  as an issue to contend with. So, perhaps that was something that made a difference 
  in the level of success and the rate of success that we enjoyed here at Fairchild. 
  
  Yeah, so I was there about five years and then, and I was handling all of the 
  manufacturing overseas. In fact, it was kind of split between Wilf was handling 
  all the wafer FAB and stuff here, and I was handling all the manufacturing tests 
  and everything that was overseas and that worked out really quite well. And 
  then after five years, I had had an opportunity to go take over the old ITT 
  operation and almost did that and decided not to. But about that time then, 
  that was in January of '74, decided the time had come to move on, do something 
  else. And the opportunity came to go to work with Jerry at AMD and again AMD 
  was doing quite well. You know, John Carey was a great engineer and the team 
  that was there did a lot of good things, but they needed someone who was, the 
  guy that could pull together all the business activities and things of that 
  nature, the purchasing and all the rest of it. And so I went with Jerry to take 
  that part of it on. And then before long, again I took over all of the assembly 
  and test operations and all the international business and ran that at AMD for 
  a number of years. And then eventually went on to become the Chief Administrative 
  Officer for Jerry, we handled legal and everything else. And that was a great 
  run. We had a good time at AMD. I remember in I guess it was January of '75, 
  I went there in '74, in the middle of that terrible depression, downturn that 
  we had in the industry at that point, Jerry and I sat down one day and looked 
  at everything and said you know, we really have three months left. By that time 
  we're going to be out of backlog, we'll be out of cash, we're going to be out 
  of inventory, we've got to do something. And so Jerry in his creative and innovative 
  ways developed a marketing program with the distributors. And there are incentives 
  and spiffs and all the things that we used to get our fair share and little 
  more than fair share of the attention of the distributors. We put that into 
  place and in February there wasn't any improvement and in March there really 
  wasn't much and in April we began to see just a glimmer and you know, we were 
  kind of like boy if we can just get this going for another few months, we're 
  going to be okay. And then we just hit that period where it just took off and 
  we had a seven-year run that was just a huge success and made AMD what it is 
  today. So it was from '75 then up to '82, whatever it was before we really hit 
  another serious bump in the road, although there were some bumps, but nothing 
  to speak of. 
RW: Well, what I observed from a design engineer standpoint was that the, AMD 
  was able to nurture good engineers even though they were a little eccentric, 
  where at Fairchild it became kind of the suits, the MBA's were in there and 
  doing their thing and, so that the engineering at AMD really was superior. 
GS: It was good engineering, but, you know, if you think about it Rob, remember 
  our strength, our success at that stage was as a second source company. I mean 
  that's what we built that business on. We were a fast second source and we were 
  determined to have better quality and reliability and better manufacturing so 
  our costs were lower. We did those things, but there were truly guys out there 
  ahead of us with products at that point. And then we went on that campaign if 
  you recall of a product a week, we did some of those and we began to then, as 
  you point out, take advantage of the strengths that were building in that organization 
  with the engineering team. 
 RW: Well the 2900 series was -
GS: Right, 2900 series -
RW: Big winner and in fact beat out Intel, which had another bipolar solution. 

GS: Yeah, yeah, so that once we got past that early phase and we got some success 
  going, then the real engineering capability began to take hold and there was 
  a lot of good innovation, a lot of good products that were designed and brought 
  into production. 
RW: Well during this period, Fairchild started to decline.
GS: Yeah. I think Fairchild at that stage, there was so many good companies 
  beginning to evolve that the challenge for Fairchild to hold onto the talent 
  that they had there was becoming increasingly difficult, whether it was at Intel 
  or in AMD or Monolithic Memories, AMI, I mean you know all the ones that were 
  around at that stage and they were all picking off this good one and that good 
  one because they had all been there and they knew who the good players were. 
  And again I think going back to what I said earlier about the time that I was 
  at Fairchild, we probably weren't as successful as we might have been had we 
  been in a more stable environment or had we been more adept at handling this 
  challenge of keeping our good talent as opposed to letting them all get picked 
  off by guys that knew them from past experience. And I think that they continued 
  to suffer from that to the point where finally the best opportunity, the best 
  alternative to them was to sell it to Schlumberger. 
RW: Yeah, well Les Hogan told me that he'd had a, some surgery just prior to 
  going to Fairchild and they had botched it and he was not well the whole, his 
  whole tenure there. 
GS: You know that's true Rob. He had a stomach problem and the surgery that 
  was done, and I don't recall exactly what the problem was, but it certainly 
  did not come out well, and I don't know that Les was ever well after that because 
  he was always a strong, big, gregarious kind of guy that, and very, very bright. 
  I mean, you know, as you know he had a lot of patents dealing with the technology 
  for core memory and things of that nature. He had great intellect and was very, 
  very capable and I think during his years at Motorola clearly demonstrated this 
  in every aspect of the business. It was not true; it was not true at Fairchild. 
  And looking back I think that that operation and whatever it was that didn't 
  go right had an impact on him the rest of his life. 
RW: Well and so Wilf Corrigan took over in kind of a palace coup. 
GS: Right, right. Yeah. Yeah that was after I left and exactly what happened 
  and how that all came together I'm not really sure because I wasn't there at 
  the time and yet, but as you point out, yeah Wilf did end up on top, there was 
  no question about it and took it to the next level.
RW: Which was Schlumberger.
GS: Which was Schlumberger, yeah.
RW: And Tom Roberts. 
GS: Tom Roberts, yeah, yeah.
RW: Now whatever became of Tom Roberts?
GS: You know, I don't know. When you mentioned him earlier, I was trying to 
  think where did he go. I've never heard of him any longer, I don't know what 
  happened to the guy. There was Tom, and there was another guy, the finance guy 
  and I can't think of his name either. He came from back East. He came from back 
  East, he was I think someone that Walter Burke put in as I remember it. Remember 
  Walter was the Chairman once, after Sherman Fairchild died and I don't recall 
  what happened to that guy either. I think that they were kind of short termers 
  in the industry or in the business at Fairchild and then disappeared. 
RW: Well Roberts was a unbelievably bad influence and that really destroyed 
  things and then Don Brooks came on and Don tried to save it and obviously he's 
  a good guy because of what he later went on to such great success. But it was 
  too late. 
GS: It was a little bit late by the time Don got there I think. But you're 
  right, I think Don Brooks was a very capable guy, is a very capable guy, did 
  a lot of good work in following on that, yeah. 
RW: Well one of the things that I now see about Fairchild was the lack of intellectual 
  property protection for architectures. Obviously people did whatever they could 
  on the process that was patented, that was trade secret, so on, but when it 
  came to architecture like when we did MSI at Fairchild, today those are the 
  same pin-outs, same functions. They're in a different process, but, and TI just 
  copied those, then AMD and everybody else, and same for Intel and the microprocessor, 
  never patented it. 
GS: Right. But if you remember though Rob, there wasn't a way of dealing with 
  that very well. A design, a mast set kind of fell between copyright and conventional 
  patents. There wasn't anything that dealt with it and that's why we came up 
  with the Chip Protection Act in 1984 as I recall. And in fact, I think one of 
  the great things that came out of that era after the heyday, the best days of 
  Fairchild, when the other companies began to emerge, Intel, AMD, and the others, 
  when we formed this Semiconductor Industry Association in 1977 to begin to deal 
  with some of these issues that were impacting us. And as I look back over that 
  period, sort of the Chip Protection Act was one of the most important ones and 
  that really stopped that copying. And in fact I remember when I was first responsible 
  for sales in Japan at AMD, and even in the Fairchild days, and every time you 
  would get something designed in over there and you start to see your sales grow 
  in about three to four or five months, next thing you know, one of those guys 
  over there had it, your sales would go to zero and they had all the business 
  and you would start all over again getting something else designed in. And it 
  was never-never land. You just became their product laboratory until we got 
  the Chip Protection Act in and we followed that, if you recall, with the two 
  trade actions that we took, one to stop the dumping, selling below cost, and 
  the second one was denial of market access in Japan, the 301 case. And at that 
  stage I was Chairman of the Public Policy Committee of the SIA and I kept pushing 
  the board to allow us to do this. And in the early '80's they wouldn't let us 
  do it because they felt they were our customers, they didn't want to alienate 
  the customer and so on. And even though they were taken advantage of what they 
  shouldn't been allowed to do, once we got the Chip Protection Act then that 
  helped, but then the, out of the dumping and the denial of access still kept 
  us as a limited player in Japan. And when we filed those two actions and then 
  we won them both. And I think this is really important because we had an option 
  at that stage. We could have gone with a solution that would have denied them 
  access to the U.S. market or could have put tariffs on it that would have raised 
  the costs and things of that nature. And our answer was no, we don't want to 
  do any of those things. All we want to do is open the Japanese market and we 
  want to eliminate predatory practices such as dumping because we were small 
  company, they were big companies, there was no way we could live with their 
  deep pockets. They could beat us hands down, plus it was illegal to dump. I 
  mean well at that stage, the GAT didn't allow dumping and we were just going 
  by the rules and we expected them to go by the rules. So we won those cases, 
  we insisted that there be no denial of market access and there would be no third 
  market dumping. And, the most critical thing was that in the event that they 
  didn't live up to that agreement, that there would be sanctions and that's one 
  thing that I insisted on that they had to understand that there was a price 
  to be paid for violating the agreement. And, as you may recall after about six 
  months, they were violating the agreement, so we went to the Reagan Administration 
  and laid out the case and said we want to have sanctions put in place. And the 
  trade agreement went in place as I recall in July of '86 and we went to the 
  Reagan Administration in March of '87 and we got them to agree to put the sanction 
  on three hundred million dollars worth of products coming in from Japan. That 
  got their attention and they started to then comply. By June we went back to 
  the government and said, start taking these sanctions off because they're beginning 
  to apply because we don't want sanctions, we want to get the lowest cost market 
  out there to create the largest possible market. And that agreement made all 
  the difference in the world. It got the whole business environment aligned with 
  the rules that everyone had to live by and those were the most innovative, the 
  most cost effective, the highest quality, were the ones that were the winners. 
  And I think that's what moved us, if you recall, we had gone from having a market 
  share greater than fifty percent, we were down in the low thirties, and Japan 
  had gone up nearly to fifty percent. Once that trade agreement was put into 
  place and unfolded over a few years, we're back up over fifty-two percent and 
  Japan is down to about twenty-five or so. So that was a very important turning 
  point and I remember, you know, once the SIA got started, Bob Noyce was very, 
  very much involved with the whole thing and he was the first Chair of the Public 
  Policy Committee and I worked very closely with him on how we should go about 
  a lot of this stuff. But as you well know, Bob would get something like this 
  going and he always looked for someone to hand it off to that he felt could 
  really take care of it. So he said to me, George you take over the Public Policy 
  now and start driving this thing. And I did for the next many, many years. I 
  think it worked out well and it was one of the important things that happened 
  in the '80's to get this industry really competing on a fair and level playing 
  field for everyone. 
RW: But it did destroy the U.S. DRAM. 
GS: Yeah, that was too late, you're right. Now, we had one left, Micron today, 
  but you're absolutely right because we filed those dumping cases on DRAM's and 
  EPROM's and our view was the DRAM, if we could get it back would be great, but 
  we really wanted to save the EPROM before they destroyed the EPROM business. 
  And as you well know, why not only the EPROM business but to follow on to the 
  flash, we're the dominant players in that market and it made a huge difference. 
  And even Micron has been able to survive and be an important player in the DRAM 
  business today.
RW: Well, tell me about the SIA, how was that founded?
GS: Well, the SIA was founded originally, again I remember we were a part of 
  the AEA at that time, the semiconductor companies, and we decided that the AEA 
  was just too big, it didn't really have our interests in mind, it was not a 
  part of their agenda. And I remember Jerry and I were given the task because 
  he was not only the AMD representative the AEA but he was representing the semiconductor 
  industry in some informal way. And we went to Chicago to the AEA board meeting 
  and talked to them about this issue and concluded that there was nothing they 
  were going to do about it. So we told them we were going to resign from the 
  AEA and we were going to do something that would focus on semiconductors. And 
  it was at that stage that we decided that we would start the SIA and it was 
  Jerry and Bob Noyce and Wilf and John Welty and Charlie Sporck got together 
  over at Ming's and came up with the framework for the SIA. And originally it 
  was really to deal with statistics, make sure because we didn't have any good 
  statistics program at that stage on what the market was and all those things, 
  but also to begin to look at, one of the things that we thought of at the time, 
  as we looked over our shoulder we could see what happened to the consumer industry, 
  how once Japan got a hold of it, we were just decimated and there was never 
  a consumer industry here in the U.S. ever again. And we were determined we weren't 
  going to let that happen. So that was the second focus of the SIA when it was 
  first started. And I think that's really, again, another key point because it 
  wasn't but another couple, three years when Japan came out with their DRAMs 
  and being a commodity product, it was very easy to sell and as we have to admit 
  they also used the leverage of a very high quality part, a very reliable part 
  to come to market. But it was also underpinned by a dumping system that gave 
  them access to the market in a very important way. And we were just in time 
  to deal with that when it began to unfold around 1980 and beyond. 
RW: So one has to say that with Japan that has been a success. 
GS: Yeah very much so, very much so.
RW: But some of that I think is also due to Intel and their monopoly position 
  in microprocessors. If you strip Intel out of the numbers, don't you get a different 
  penetration? 
GS: Well you would sure. But again, if you go back to the '80's where the microprocessor 
  was not that big a deal and we were broad based, we still had the lion's share 
  of the market once we got things sorted out. Now Intel has helped us keep it 
  as more of the consumer products have, well first of all, consumer products 
  began to fall off from roughly twenty-five percent of the market down to about 
  fifteen. Not it's begun to climb back up again around twenty or so. But there 
  were shifts in the market that had an impact. The microprocessor had an impact, 
  flash and EPROMs were big, but then you had the ASICs that you guys came together 
  with and formed LSI with. There were a number of things that we still led the 
  parade and were important contributors to that fifty plus percent of the market, 
  but clearly could not have been done without the microprocessor, but let's face 
  it, that's been the heart of the business. I mean if you look at the markets 
  for our products today, about twenty-five percent of the product goes into PCs 
  and about another twenty-five percent of our product goes into the cell phone 
  and that sort of activity. So, information technology's taken up about seventy-odd 
  percent of our product today and we're very good there. 
RW: Well one of the questions as fab's have reached the billion dollar level 
  and above and their lifetime is five or seven or eight or ten years, there are 
  fewer and fewer people that actually manufacture their own semiconductors. So, 
  what's going to happen in ten years from now? I mean, who's going to be making 
  silicon?
GS: You know that's a really good question. There's quite a debate going on 
  about that right today. It's my view that the heyday of the fabless foundry 
  business model may have passed already. Certainly it has been a good way to 
  get into the business for the last ten or so years. All you had to do is have 
  a workstation, have a good design idea, and someone that could do the job and 
  away you went. But if you think about it, not many of those companies are very 
  large or very successful. I mean there, I understand there are like three hundred 
  fabless companies. Well, I don't think there are three hundred fabless companies 
  that are making very much product and making much of an impact on the industry. 
  The ones that are making the impact are the big ones, nVidia, Broadcom, Altera, 
  Xilinx, the ones that have focused on an area and have become an important player 
  in that area. Now I do think that the need to tie the process technology to 
  the manufacturing and the design is becoming greater once again. And therefore, 
  the integrated device manufacturers that are really focused on process technology 
  and making certain that it's tied very closely so that those designs are going 
  to function that much better than everyone else, going to be that much more 
  cost effective and so on, are going to make the real difference going forward. 
  So that, I think that although the foundry fabless business model will continue, 
  I think it will diminish in importance and we're going to see some very tightly 
  coupled relationships with a few key players in that part of the arena, and 
  then the IBMs, the Intels, the IBMs, Motorolas, TI, are going to have the greatest 
  advantage as far as taking their products to market in the future. We're going 
  to another phase of this transition. What I'm worried about is that we not be 
  too late in executing on this. We have got to make certain that we keep the 
  manufacturing capability here at home, we can't let it all go to China, we have 
  to make certain that that basic research in our universities continues so that 
  we have those students and that next generation technology flowing to us. And 
  if we have those two things in place, then we're going to continue to have the 
  IBMs located here doing that whole ecosystem and as a consequent, we'll maintain 
  our technology leadership because I'm convinced that without the manufacturing 
  capability, we will eventually erode our technology leadership and we can't 
  let that happen and we're not going to let that happen. 
RW: Yeah, now I understand what you're saying about it, but the fact remains 
  that you need such a tremendous volume of product, eight or ten billion dollars 
  to justify putting in that new manufacturing, who could afford that?
GS: Well again, I think that perhaps the next phase of the business model will 
  be a combination of the IBM and foundry so that they can drive the technology, 
  but also fill in the FAB as quickly as necessary so that the depreciation doesn't 
  overwhelm the cost structure and allows them to be very competitive. And you 
  are seeing a lot of that going on today with companies like IBM. IBM is picking 
  off some of the very best of the fabless companies and they're having their 
  foundry work done there now. And it's because of that, first of all that close 
  relationship and it's also the fact that the system, the ecosystem here at home 
  becomes a part of that and therefore it allows that fabless company to get that 
  next generation of technology flowing to them earlier. You know, at the SIA 
  now we have, well first of all, let me step back. If you recall, back in the 
  early '80's we put together the Semiconductor Research Corporation and again 
  Bob Noyce was at the heart of that thing and I worked closely with him for two 
  reasons: one to get more engineers that were trained in our disciplines and 
  the second was to get the technology developed in the university so that we 
  had that flow. We also have, and that's still going today, we fund that to the 
  level of about thirty-five, forty million dollars a year. About three or four 
  years ago, we started the Focus Center Program and there what we're doing is 
  we're taking the technology roadmap that we began to publish back in 1992, I 
  think it was, in fact I remember the meeting that a few of us had along with 
  Gordon Moore. And Gordon came up with the idea of this, we need a roadmap to 
  show us where we're going with this technology and where we have the gaps and 
  what we need to do to make certain that we solve those problems so we can continue 
  to implement Moore's law. And so we evolved the roadmap, which is an incredible 
  document today and now it's worked on internationally as well as here at home. 
  But the focus centers now looks at that roadmap and sees where, as we call them, 
  the red brick walls are, and we then define these development programs that 
  we then fund. And that's a program now where we have four projects, one on design 
  and test, another one on layout, another one on systems and software, and the 
  fourth one is on devices and structures. And with that, we now have the work 
  being done four or five generations back in the pipeline that we're going to 
  be using in five, seven, eight years, but we'll be ready. And hence it's our 
  belief as a consequence of all of this, that combination of the roadmap and 
  the focus centers and so on, that we can continue to implement Moore's law for 
  the next ten to fifteen years as we get it down to five nanometers, wherever 
  we're going to end up it's going to be pretty low. 
RW: Well tell me about these focus centers, you know, cite an example.
GS: Well, the way we have them set up, the design and test is headquartered 
  out of Berkeley, UC Berkeley. Layout is headquartered out in Georgia Tech. And 
  then the system software is at Carnegie Mellon and device of the structure is 
  at MIT. But in addition to those four outstanding research universities, we 
  have about another twenty-five, Stanford and University of Illinois and a whole 
  list of others that collaborate on these projects and we fund that to the tune 
  of about twenty-five million dollars a year and it's making a huge difference 
  on getting us prepared for the next generations as we begin to run into some 
  of these problems, whether it's on Locay or a whole host of things that are 
  constantly popping up that we have to address. 
RW: Well, yes of course, as you visit those universities and you see the students 
  that are involved, they're almost all foreign born. 
GS: Well that's a problem, there's no question about it and in the past that's 
  been a strength. It is something now that we have to be concerned with. Roughly, 
  it's probably fifty-fifty right now, or maybe it's sixty-forty foreign born 
  to U.S. based. But they all wanted to stay here in the past. That's beginning 
  to change. A lot of them want to go back home now, whether it's India or China, 
  wherever. And as a consequence, why the challenge that we have is greater that 
  it was in the past. But again, one of the critical things is making certain 
  that the opportunity for those folks that have worked so hard on developing 
  this technology and learning all of this have a challenge when they come out 
  of school here at home, as opposed to having to go to either Taiwan or China 
  to work in a state of the art fab. So, we're working very hard on that program 
  right now to make certain that we find ways for states in the, cause I think 
  this is not a federal issue, I think this is largely a state government issue 
  that decides that we're going to have an opportunity for wafer fabs in our state 
  and we're going to look at the incentives that either Taiwan or Shanghai, or 
  wherever it turns out to be that is attracting them, what is it that they're 
  doing and how can we compete with that? Now one of the things that's important 
  about that, the cost structure is such that labor is not the dominant issue, 
  or it's not even the issue that is going to make the difference in the final 
  analysis because again depreciation as you point out, there's so much cost in 
  the equipment and building and that's the same for everyone. So we just need 
  to figure out how they're dealing with other things. The way they handle stock 
  options is far more advantageous than it is here. They have a negative tax in 
  Taiwan that works to their advantage. There are ways that they fund development 
  programs that are in a very oblique way and you can go on down the list of things. 
  They have a value-added tax where they make it far more attractive to be inside 
  of China than outside of China, on and on. And we just have to find ways to 
  make certain we can combat every one of those and have a competitive environment 
  here and let our young students go to work here as opposed to have to go somewhere 
  else. Or, worst of all, not take the courses and have none of that development 
  take place here. For sure if that would ever occur, we're going to lose our 
  technology lead. 
RW: Well people are already going to India for design and I guess the venture 
  capitalists are starting to say that they're not going to fund a U.S. detail 
  design, layout, that sort of thing, that they want the American company to go 
  to India and outsource it. 
GS: I don't buy that. I think that we have to continue to develop those EDA 
  tools that will put us at the lead as far as our ability to design the most 
  complex circuits that are going to work the first time around, all of the things, 
  you know, the synthesis and all of the things that you have been so much a part 
  of, that still has to be one of our lead efforts and we have to be very good 
  at it. And I think we can and then with that, yeah, the cost of a design engineer 
  in India is less, there's no question about it, but we can use them as part 
  of that puzzle to solve the problem, the whole twenty-four hour idea. So I think 
  there are ways of developing a business model that allows us to take advantage 
  of all the important pieces. They don't all exist in any one place perhaps any 
  longer as they did here, but they don't all exist in India either, or China, 
  or anywhere else. We've got to be creative, innovative, in dealing with that 
  issue. 
RW: Well George, both of us have been in the business a long time and we both 
  met our wives in business and our wives are engineers. So tell us about yours.
GS: Yeah, that's right. I guess we're, Rob, you and I are unique in that regard 
  that we both are engineers and we have wives that are engineers. It's kind of 
  interesting, when I left Massachusetts, CBS, I had on a few occasions, heard 
  of a young lady engineer that had worked there prior to my getting to CBS. And 
  her name was Dot McDonald and it didn't mean anything to me, I had just heard 
  of her. And never thought that much about it because it didn't make any difference. 
  I went to Phoenix as I told you and got started there at Motorola and within 
  the first twenty-four hours of being there, I had to find an apartment to live 
  in clearly. And the personnel people took me to meet this young lady by the 
  name of Dot McDonald because she had moved in sometime back and she was single 
  and she had an apartment and she probably knew about where good apartments were. 
  So, well that's fine, so I met her and I asked her, you know, where she lived 
  and she told me and I thought well if she lives there, it must be a pretty good 
  place. So, I went to this same apartment complex. They weren't very big and 
  they weren't very elegant, but they were very adequate, very adequate. And so 
  they had a couple of places available. It turns out one of them was right above 
  her apartment, it was a two story place and it was right above her. So I negotiated 
  with this, the landlord there about the price that I thought it was too high, 
  I don't know, it was sixty-five dollars a month or something, but wasn't making 
  very much money. And I negotiated him down and I got the apartment. Well, she 
  came home later, I was gone because I wasn't living there yet, and this guy 
  that owned the place came over and he was cussing and swearing that this new 
  guy came into town and he came over here and he negotiated me down and he was 
  mad about it, but he couldn't cheat her out of that same thing, so he offered 
  to give her the same benefit, that she could have the lower rent as well. So 
  that wasn't a bad start. So I, then as we got to, you know, I started working 
  there within a day or so of that then and became more familiar, I kept hearing 
  people talking about this Dot McDonald, and we eventually, why within a week 
  I would guess, why we probably got together for either lunch or dinner, I'm 
  not sure what the first was, but at any rate, decided that gee, she's a pretty 
  smart lady. She's a mathematician, she's a physicist, she's a good engineer, 
  she runs the in-process quality control, a very attractive lady, and, you know, 
  I looked at this a little bit more seriously I guess. And I was single as well 
  and it was about that time we were both in our late twenties. So we started 
  dating right away and within a couple of months why we decided to get engaged, 
  it was three months I guess it was, three months I think, we got engaged and 
  within six months we got married. And we came back East to get married because 
  we were both, she was from Massachusetts, I was from Pennsylvania. So we met 
  on middle ground and we got married just outside of New York City in White Plains, 
  New York where her brother lived. And for the first time, why we met each other's 
  parents, we had never met anyone in the family before, we only met them for 
  one of two days I guess before we headed off on our honeymoon and headed back 
  to Arizona. So, that was forty-two years ago and three children and a wonderful 
  life later, why it's been a wonderful marriage. So it's great to have an engineer 
  as a wife and a family all come together. 
RW: I think that's one of the lamest pick up lines I think I've ever heard. 

GS: What's that?
RW: Well honey, I can save you money on your apartment. 
GS: I didn't, I was not necessarily prepared at that stage to make that the 
  entrée. Now it turned out to be the entrée, but it wasn't necessarily 
  my plan. I probably could have planned it better. But nonetheless, it worked. 
  And forty-two years now I guess we can say it's worked, it's just fine, it's 
  good. So yeah, it's been a wonderful life in the industry and certainly here 
  at home with my wife and the three children and all the experiences we've had 
  since. The other thing that I think has been good about this experience in the 
  industry and again as you recall, when we first got involved and even here in 
  the valley, the industry wasn't well known. I mean when you talked about semiconductors, 
  no one outside the industry knew much about it and as far as here was concerned, 
  you know San Francisco was the place and down here in the valley why it didn't 
  matter. It's been fun to see how that has changed now where we have now become 
  the real center of this whole area and San Francisco now is certainly as important 
  as it is in some other ways, now it sees the valley as the real driving force 
  around here. And again I think that's underscored by the fact that information 
  technology represents what eight percent of the GDP but thirty percent of the 
  growth and affects the overall economy in such an important way. And again, 
  I think the thing that happened as a result of that, the recognition that has 
  come to the industry and to a lot of the individuals is one of the other really 
  satisfying parts of what has happened here over these years that we've been 
  involved to the point now where, I mean in my case I happen to be the Vice Chairman 
  of the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco. I'm the first technology guy that 
  has ever been on the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank. Now, one 
  would think that that should have happened perhaps fifteen or twenty years ago 
  when we were beginning to become an important part of the economy, but it wasn't 
  seen that way at that stage. But to the extent that it's important to have arrived 
  as an industry, I think that has happened and we're now recognized for that 
  in so many ways, whether it's in the political arena or in the financial or 
  whatever it turns out to be, people know semiconductors are important in the 
  contribution they're making and I think that's one of the real satisfying parts 
  of having had the opportunity to be in with this from the very early days in 
  the late '50's all the way up through today. So, I think it's also a tribute 
  to you to put this program together to record all of these thoughts of the many 
  of us that have been around the industry for a long time because as you pointed 
  out, we had a unique opportunity. Fortunately many of us were able to take advantage 
  of that and perhaps make a contribution to the better life, the standard of 
  living improvement for people, not just here in the valley, but around the world. 
  And I think that's one of the great things that has come out of this industry. 

RW: Well thank you George.
GS: Thank you Rob, I really appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this 
  program.

Hitta foto... This region represented 46.6% of the global market for microchips at year end. The largest share of the market is in China, which has become the world's leading manufacturer of electronics products. U.S. semiconductor companies have over 70 percent of their manufacturing capacity in the United States, while less than a third of our markets are here. We are hopeful that a systematic collection of the penalties meted out for IP violations will pressure those regions within China where the penalties are insufficient to deter counterfeiting. We expect the modest growth we are experiencing in the first half of the year to continue throughout the remainder of 2002. We expect to see the industry record slow growth for the first quarter of 2002, with sales rising to double-digit growth in the second half of the year. We feel as though they not only heard us, but understand the situation and will respond in a way to bring about new programs. What's changed this time is a recognition of what we have to do to compete. We have full confidence they will be implemented and we will be very successful. This is going to be a bipartisan effort. We see very strong, solid demand pattern ahead of us. We're talking about 10 percent compounded annual growth rate between 2005 and 2008. While information technology products will continue to be the largest market sectors for semiconductors, consumer products will be the major growth-drivers in the years ahead, While the computation sector is down, all other sectors including wireless and consumer continue to thrive. This increase drove the sales of such products as flash, digital signal processors, application-specific products and analog. While there are lingering concerns about the effects of high energy prices and the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the US, end markets for semiconductors continue to be very strong. WTO cases generally take too long.Sidan 4 av 4<tidigare 1 2 3 4NordicQuotes.comNumber of proverbs are 1466250varav 1407627 p� engelskaProverb (1466250 st) SearchCategories (2627 st) Search
