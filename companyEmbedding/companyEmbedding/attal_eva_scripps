Scripps investor buys 21,143 shares

Attal Eva Scripps, who already controls more than 10% of the
  outstanding shares of
  Scripps Networks (
  SNI

  )

  , bought 21,143 shares of the company's common stock on Jan. At
  $74.71 per share Scripps paid a total of $1,580,227.82 for the
  new shares.
  

IK->

  The technicals for SNI ($71.41 down $0.35) are bearish with a
  downward trend. The stock is below recent support and recent
  resistance has been around $73.49. Look at the March 60/65
  bull-put spread for a 35-cent credit or better. That's a 7.5%
  return and the stock has to fall 9.0% to cause a problem.
