About Diamcor

Diamcor Mining Inc. is a fully reporting publically traded junior diamond mining company which is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol V.DMI, and on the OTC QX International under the symbol DMIFF.  The Company has a well-established prior operational and production history in South Africa, extensive prior experience supplying rough diamonds to the world market, and has established a long-term strategic alliance with world famous Tiffany & Co.  Rather than exposing itself to the high risks and costs associated with traditional exploration, the Company’s focus is on the identification, acquisition, and operation of unique diamond projects with near-term production potential such as the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project.

Overview | Diamcor Mining Inc.








































 





Overview
Krone - Endora at Venetia
So Ver
Exploration



 

Overview

Diamcor focuses on the identification, acquisition, and operation of near-term production based diamond projects which demonstrate the potential to generate sustained diamond production and cash flow. Diamcor's experienced Management and operational team have a proven history of successful project operation on a 24/7 basis in South Africa. The Company's production based focus is a clear, and intended deviation from the typical high-risk exploration focus aimed at the discovery and establishment of new kimberlite diamond mines. Instead, Diamcor focuses on acquiring projects which deal with the processing of tailings reserves using modern technologies (some tailings reserves in S.A. are approaching 50 years old), and/or, the very careful selection of quality alluvial and Eluvial projects which allow for the recoveries of documented diamondiferous gravels using simple, low cost strip-mining types of operations. Both project types have the potential to achieve sustained diamond production with short lead-times to that production. Many industry experts agree that when the growing demands from emerging markets of China and India are combined with economic recoveries around the world, there will be a significant shortfall in the current known world wide diamond productions abilities to meet those demands.

About Diamcor

Diamcor Mining Inc. is a fully reporting publically traded junior diamond mining company which is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol V.DMI, and on the OTC QX International under the symbol DMIFF.  The Company has a well-established prior operational and production history in South Africa, extensive prior experience supplying rough diamonds to the world market, and has established a long-term strategic alliance with world famous Tiffany & Co.  Rather than exposing itself to the high risks and costs associated with traditional exploration, the Company’s focus is on the identification, acquisition, and operation of unique diamond projects with near-term production potential such as the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project.

Diamcor Mining Inc. (“Diamcor” or “the Company”) is a publically traded Canadian company with a proven history of supplying rough diamonds to the world market. In March of 2011 the Company established a long-term strategic alliance with world famous luxury retailer Tiffany & Co. and is now in the final stages of developing the near-term production capable Krone-Endora at Venetia Project (“Krone-Endora”or “the Project”). Krone-Endora was successfully acquired from De Beers in Februaury of 2011 and is located directly adjacent to the third largest diamond mine in the world, De Beers flagship Venetia Mine. The Project’s near surface deposits have been identified as being the direct result of the shift and erosion of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia kimberlites giving the Company the rare potential to provide low-cost, near-term, sustained rough diamond production from a known source at a time when rough diamond shortages are increasing. Extensive exploration, drilling, bulk sampling, and an initial NI43-101 have been completed, and the finalization of site preparations, infrastructure, and the construction of a modular processing plant are now nearing completion. In addition to the ongoing development and expansion of Krone-Endora, the Company’s strategy is the continued identification, acquisition, and operation of quality production based diamond projects which demonstrate the potential to further increase its yearly production levels and support the long-term objectives of its shareholders and strategic alliance partner.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

	Diamcor Mining Inc. (“Diamcor” or “the Company”) is a publically traded Canadian company with a proven history of supplying rough diamonds to the world market.

	 

	In March of 2011 the Company established a long-term strategic alliance with world famous luxury retailer Tiffany & Co. and is now in the final stages of developing the near-term production capable Krone-Endora at Venetia Project (“Krone-Endora”or “the Project”). Krone-Endora was successfully acquired from DeBeers in Februaury of 2011 and is located directly adjacent to the third largest diamond mine in the world, DeBeers flagship Venetia Mine. 

	 

	The Project’s near surface deposits have been identified as being the direct result of the shift and erosion of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia kimberlites giving the Company the rare potential to provide low-cost, near-term, sustained rough diamond production from a known source at a time when rough diamond shortages are increasing. 

	 

	Extensive exploration, drilling, bulk sampling, and an initial NI43-101 have been completed, and the finalization of site preparations, infrastructure, and the construction of a modular processing plant are now nearing completion. In addition to the ongoing development and expansion of Krone-Endora, the Company’s strategy is the continued identification, acquisition, and operation of quality production based diamond projects which demonstrate the potential to further increase its yearly production levels and support the long-term objectives of its shareholders and strategic alliance partner.

The first fiscal quarter rough diamond tender and sales of 8,318.82 carats represents a ~38% decrease when compared to the 13,384.72 carats tendered and sold in the Company's first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2016.  The reduction was due to limited processing completed as compared to the same period during the prior fiscal year given the testing, commissioning, and calibration work being undertaken in the current year's period.  However, despite the 38% decrease in total carats sold during the current fiscal quarter, the Company achieved gross revenues of USD $1,851,122.55, only a 3% decrease when compared to revenues of USD $1,905,978.44, realized during the same period in the prior fiscal year.  The average dollar per carat of USD $222.52, from the processing of material in the +1.0mm to -45mm size fractions through the Project's newly expanded facilities in the first fiscal quarter, represents a 56% increase as compared to an average dollar per carat of USD $142.40, for the same period in the previous fiscal year when the facilities processed only materials in the +1.0mm to -26mm size fractions.  Rough diamonds delivered, tendered and sold in the current period were the result of rough diamonds recovered prior to May 25, 2017.  Rough diamonds recovered after May 25 and until June 30, 2017 will be recorded as rough diamond inventory on-hand for the first fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017.SponsoredBanyan HillIt's Easily the No. 1 Stock to OwnPaul reveals his No. 1 investment for 2017 ... an investment that he says will "hand you a rare once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become ...CNW Group•18 days agoDiamcor Provides Results of Rough Diamond Tenders and Operational Update for First Fiscal QuarterDiamcor Provides Results of Rough Diamond Tenders and Operational Update for First Fiscal QuarterYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
