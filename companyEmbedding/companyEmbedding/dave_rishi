Rishi Dave, VR ads, and how AI might not replace marketers — VB Engage

Stewart Rogers@TheRealSJRTravis Wright, CCP.Digital@teedubya July 5, 2017 11:29 AM



 





This week, Travis and Stewart discuss Google’s latest lab project — VR ads. Apparently, we can’t escape ads even in our virtual realities. We also talk about some smart AI-powered video solutions and analytics for smart speakers.
Rishi Dave is our guest in this episode, which gives us a chance to be schooled by one of the leading CMOs on everything martech-related, including the future of AI.


By listening to this episode of VB Engage, you will hear:

Welcome to VB Engage episode 58! [0:10]
Stewart and Travis hung out in Vancouver at the Unbounce CTA Conference. [01:15]
CTAConf was a spectacular marketing conference, with some of the top minds in marketing speaking at the event. [02:00]
We interviewed Unbounce CEO Oli Gardner on the stage in front of 1200+ marketers. [02:20]
There will be an upcoming series of VB Engage CTAConf interviews with the likes of Mari Smith, Rand Fishkin, Scott Stratton, and Wil Reynolds. [2:45]
Adobe launches voice analytics for Siri, Alexa, and other intelligent assistants. [03:20]
Adobe has done a bit of rebranding on its cloud; it has the marketing cloud, the analytics cloud, and the creative cloud. [03:40]
Adobe Analytics for intelligent assistants tracks metrics like: [04:15]

User ID
Intent
Number of users
Number of sessions
Session length
Frequency of use
Error rate


Frequency of use and error rate are the two the most important metrics in conversational UI. [04:50]
Google wants to bring advertising into virtual reality with the ad cube. [05:15]
Google makes 94 percent of its money from advertising — did you think they would not create VR ads? [06:05]
In VR, there will be few moments when we have buyer’s intent while in VR. [07:20]
Get your ad blockers ready for the cube! [07:25]
Google’s AI-powered video analyzer hits public beta this week! [08:35]
One big use case for this AI video analyzer is with the identification of adult content to help with safe search. [09:30]
It is getting better at reading emotions. [10:00]
This will certainly evolve into VR/AR visual analytics. [10:20]
Back in the day, Travis imagined buying a jacket that Joey was wearing on this one episode of Friends. With this tech, you’ll be able to identify products easily. [11:15]
When this product identification interface is embedded into AR glasses, buying products will be inspired by real world interactions. [11:35]
Now let’s chat with Rishi Dave, CMO of Dun & Bradstreet. [12:35]
Rishi calls himself “the Chief Madness Officer.” [13:30]
Each week, we discuss something new with artificial intelligence and how that impacts the life of the marketer. [14:20]
Before we can tackle AI, marketers need to tackle data quality and predictive models for your data. [15:30]
Marketers are not thinking about their data enough, still. [15:50]
Start with the data, and leverage third-party data to help you clean up and optimize your data. [16:40]
Create a master data set by cleaning your data. The DUNS number is the unifying id. [17:15]
Now you can build models on top of that data with artificial intelligence to gain insights. [17:40]
How can you better surface those insights? [18:00]
DnB recently acquired Avention to help with sales acceleration. [19:00]
Every week, we are covering companies that are using AI in marketing, but none of that matters if your data is bad! [19:20]
Beyond AI, what can marketers be doing now to get back to being good marketers? [20:05]
The biggest thing that marketers can do is to accept that change is happening with AI and think about the change management within your organization. [21:00]
Marketing is madness, and we need more specialists. DnB hires specialists. [21:25]
Experts like to work within their silos. Rishi creates “Tiger Teams,” cross-functional teams in service of particular customers and personas. [22:10]
Start to create processes that take advantage of these changes. [22:40]
Hire people who are not just specialists, but can collaborate. [23:00]
How can organizations break down the silo between sales and marketing? [23:35]
If you have a blurred line between sales and marketing, that’s how you know you have effective alignment. [24:35]
Pipeline doesn’t pay the bills. [25:00]
Marketing has to metric itself to sales like sales metrics itself to sales. [25:15]
Joint metrics based on bottom line: sales. [25:30]
Facial recognition via your AR glasses to gain insights on the people in the room with you is not science fiction. [27:00]
With Elon Musk’s NeuralLink, we will become sales and marketing cyborgs before we know it! [28:15]

Next week, we chat with the one and only Ben Parr, cofounder of Octane.AI, and he shares with us the secret to a killer Facebook chatbot.
Last week, Travis and Stewart interviewed Damien Mahoney, CEO of Stackla, who tells us everything we need to know about user-generated content, machine learning, AI, and what the future holds for consumer engagement.
As always, thanks for tuning in to VB Engage. Please review it and rate it on your favorite podcast platform. I mean, after all, it’s the least you could do after listening to all of these episodes.
Until next week!

Dun & Bradstreet CMO Rishi Dave Talks Marketing Transformation
Former Dell Exec Brings Marketing Tech, Content Strategy to 173-Year-Old Company


	By  

Kate Maddox.
	

	
	
 Published on October 08, 2014. 














Most Popular






 

Rishi Dave was named CMO at Dun & Bradstreet in February -- the first CMO in recent history at the financial services company, and one of the first major hires by Bob Carrigan, the former CEO of IDG Communications who was appointed president-CEO of D&B last September.
Mr. Dave, who previously served as executive director-digital marketing for the b-to-b business at Dell, is bringing his skills in social media, content marketing and mobile to transform the 173-year-old company's marketing team into a more digitally focused organization.



		Rishi Dave 
 	

One of his first moves was selecting Droga5, New York, as creative agency of record to handle a brand relaunch that will be unveiled early next year, including everything from a new visual identity to a redefined brand purpose.
In the following interview, Mr. Dave discusses how he's bringing change to an established financial services company and using new technologies and strategies to achieve his goals.
Advertising Age: What is your biggest challenge?
Mr. Dave: The challenge is Dun & Bradstreet is a 173-year-old company that is known for credit reporting, but that is only a part of what we do. As we modernize our company, our brand must reflect not just what we have been but where we are today -- which is providing data to some of the biggest corporations in the world -- and where we will be tomorrow. The biggest challenge is really locking down in a very simple way what our purpose is and building a communications and messaging strategy behind that.
The next big piece is how we activate it. We don't want to activate it in a traditional way -- it won't be a traditional, big-bang, TV-type launch. The b-to-b buyer is very different now -- very digitally focused. So a lot of what we're doing is modern, digitally focused activation.
Ad Age: What will the relaunch include?
Mr. Dave: We're looking at the whole stack. There are really three components to the activation. The first is a marketing and content platform, things like marketing automation, content management and content operations.
The second is analytics -- how we manage analytics, track and report.










The third is content and thought leadership. We just hired a head of content. Our customers interact with us through content and thought leadership, and we're focused on building scalable, always-on content to drive inbound marketing.
Ad Age: You did a lot of mobile at Dell. Are you using mobile as part of your strategy at D&B?
Mr. Dave: We are absolutely doing mobile. We have a product called Mobile IQ that enables the field sales team to have data on mobile phones, and we're looking at executing all of our marketing with a mobile-first mentality. The site today is responsive-design, and in the future it will be completely mobile-optimized.
Ad Age: What are some of the differences in moving from a high-tech computer company to an established financial services company?
Mr. Dave: One of the differences is, because it's an iconic 173-year-old company, there's a lot of history there. As we looked at our history -- President Lincoln was an employee of D&B -- it helped guide how we brand ourselves and where we're going.
There are also different skill sets in terms of marketing. At Dell, I ran digital marketing, and here I run marketing across all the different functions. One of the big differences when I came on is that all aspects of marketing around the world were pulled together under the CMO, directly reporting to the CEO. Marketing became a global function across all aspects, whereas before it was more decentralized and regionalized.
