Yongnuo YN-622C II overview




1Description







Trigger flashes wirelessly with this 2-pack of YN-622C II E-TTL Wireless Flash Transceivers from Yongnuo. Compatible with Canon E-TTL / E-TTL II cameras and with added support for 622 and 560-RX communication protocols this set will function well with many flash units. For usage, one transceiver slides directly into the hot shoe and utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency with a range of 328' to trigger the remote flashes mounted on the other transceiver. A variety of features have been added in the model, including support for group ratios and multi flash. The transceivers also have a hot shoe and PC sync port available for mounting a flash unit or connecting to a strobe. When connected to a strobe via the PC sync port, a Super Sync function will allow photographers to achieve a faster sync speed than normally possible with their camera. Additionally, there are both TTL and manual flash modes available for full creative control. And, it can utilize 7 channels and 3 groups for setting up multiple flash units easily and efficiently. 
 
The YN-622C utilizes a series of LEDs to display settings and allow users to make adjustments. On the device is also an AF assist beam to help in low-light conditions. Multiple sync modes are available for more specific needs or effects, including 1st 2nd curtain sync. A high speed sync mode is available and will help in bright lighting conditions and for stopping motion with a maximum speed of 1/8000 second. Additionally, the transceivers run on 2 AA batteries each.

Yongnuo YN-622C II overview




1Description







Trigger flashes wirelessly with this 2-pack of YN-622C II E-TTL Wireless Flash Transceivers from Yongnuo. Compatible with Canon E-TTL / E-TTL II cameras and with added support for 622 and 560-RX communication protocols this set will function well with many flash units. For usage, one transceiver slides directly into the hot shoe and utilizes a 2.4 GHz frequency with a range of 328' to trigger the remote flashes mounted on the other transceiver. A variety of features have been added in the model, including support for group ratios and multi flash. The transceivers also have a hot shoe and PC sync port available for mounting a flash unit or connecting to a strobe. When connected to a strobe via the PC sync port, a Super Sync function will allow photographers to achieve a faster sync speed than normally possible with their camera. Additionally, there are both TTL and manual flash modes available for full creative control. And, it can utilize 7 channels and 3 groups for setting up multiple flash units easily and efficiently. 
 
The YN-622C utilizes a series of LEDs to display settings and allow users to make adjustments. On the device is also an AF assist beam to help in low-light conditions. Multiple sync modes are available for more specific needs or effects, including 1st 2nd curtain sync. A high speed sync mode is available and will help in bright lighting conditions and for stopping motion with a maximum speed of 1/8000 second. Additionally, the transceivers run on 2 AA batteries each.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
