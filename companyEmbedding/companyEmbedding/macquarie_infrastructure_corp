       HAWAI'IGAS produces and distributes synthetic natural gas and distributes propane
    

       HAWAI'IGAS is a producer and distributor of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and a distributor of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) on the six major islands of Hawaii. HAWAI'IGAS owns and operates an SNG plant and more than 1,100 miles of pipeline serving approximately 35,000 utility customers (businesses and households). The business serves an additional approximately 34,000 non-utility customers via on-site propane tanks or portable gas cylinders.
    

       HAWAI'IGAS operates the only gas utility in the Hawaii islands and the state's largest LPG distribution business.  HAWAI'IGAS’s utility business is regulated by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. HAWAI'IGAS has been meeting the state’s needs for gas safely and reliably for more than 100 years.
    

       The drivers of growth in this business include economic expansion in the state of Hawaii and shifts among end users between gas and other energy sources and competitors.  HAWAI'IGAS's two primary products, SNG and LPG, are relatively clean-burning fuels that produce lower levels of carbon emissions than other hydrocarbon fuels such as coal or oil.  This is particularly important in Hawaii where heightened public awareness of environmental impact makes lower emission products attractive to customers.
    

       Visit the HAWAI'IGAS website for more information.

Macquarie Infrastructure Corp Larger Than S&P 500 Component Foot Locker


July 21, 2017, 04:41:39 PM EDT
By TheOnlineInvestor.com, BNK Invest









































Shutterstock photo


In the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Macquarie Infrastructure Corp (Symbol: MIC) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Foot Locker, Inc. (Symbol: FL), according to The Online Investor  . Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true "apples-to-apples" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Macquarie Infrastructure Corp (Symbol: MIC), the market cap is now $6.25B, versus Foot Locker, Inc. (Symbol: FL) at $6.2B.    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MIC vs. FL:       Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and "tosses out" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller "up-and-comers" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.      MIC,FL makes up 3467.31% of the iShares Russell 2500 ETF ( SMMD  )    At the closing bell, MIC is off about 0.6%, while FL is down about 1.6% on the day Friday.

Is Macquarie Infrastructure Corp A Buy? - Macquarie Infrastructure Corp (NYSE:MIC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Is Macquarie Infrastructure Corp A Buy?Mar.23.16 | About: Macquarie Infrastructure (MIC) Canadian Dividend Growth Investor Long only, value, dividend growth investingMarketplaceDGI Across North AmericaSummaryMacquarie Infrastructure has outperformed the S&P 500 in the last 10 years and particularly in the last 5.
        However, MIC has underperformed the S&P 500 since October.
        MIC is managed externally by a professional team and its performance is dependent on the 4 diversified businesses it owns and subsequent investments.
        MIC yields 7%. This year, MIC targets to grow its distribution per share by 16.6% compared to its 2015 payout.
          In May 2015, Macquarie Infrastructure Corp (NYSE:MIC) converted from a limited liability company to a corporation. Over the past 5-year and 10-year periods, Macquarie Infrastructure has outperformed SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). 

 Source: Google Finance However, in the past year, Macquarie Infrastructure has declined 20.4% while SPY has only declined 2.7%. Specifically, Macquarie Infrastructure has started to underperform since late October 2015. What's going on? More on this later, but first, let's explore Macquarie Infrastructure as a business. The business Macquarie Infrastructure is a holding company that relies on the performances of the businesses it holds to pay expenses and dividends. Macquarie Infrastructure holds four businesses:  International-Matex Tank Terminals [IMTT] is a regional distribution centre for refined products, storing and handling bulk liquids at 10 marine terminals in the U.S. and 2 in Canada Atlantic Aviation provides fuel, terminal, and aircraft hangar services in 69 airports in the United States Contracted Power and Energy [CP&E] controls interests in gas-fired, wind, and solar power facilities in the U.S. Hawaii Gas processes and distributes gas in Hawaii  The EBITDA diversification is shown below: 

 Source: Q4 2015 Results Supplementary Material (pdf) - Slide 4 Since Macquarie Infrastructure generates most of its EBITDA from IMTT and Atlantic Aviation, Macquarie Infrastructure's performance is dependent on the well-being of those businesses. IMTT continues to be a stable performer, and Atlantic Aviation exceeded expectations last year. Let's take a look at these businesses in closer detail. IMTT Macquarie Infrastructure acquired 50% of IMTT in 2006 and acquired the rest in July 2014. Last year, 55% of IMTT's revenue was generated from storing and handling refined petroleum products, 23% was generated from storing and handling chemicals, 6% was from storing and handling biofuels (i.e. renewable/vegetable and animal oil), and 3% was from storing and handling crude oil and asphalt. 

 Source: IMTT website IMTT's clients are mostly major oil companies, major chemical companies, or traders of these commodities. About 50% of IMTT's 2015 revenue was generated by its top 10 clients of which 8 were investment grade and the other 2 were not rated. IMTT doesn't do business with the exploration and production part of the oil industry that has the highest risk of creditworthy issues. Because IMTT's business performance is not macro-factor sensitive, it should continue to give a stable performance with little sensitivity to the fluctuation of commodity prices. This view is supported by IMTT's recent performance. From 2013 to 2015, IMTT's gross profit increased at an average rate of 6.8% and its EBITDA increased at an average rate of 6.1%. Last year, its gross profit increased 2.7% to $327.3M and EBITDA increased 5.9% to $302.1M, which aligns with MIC's expectations. Atlantic Aviation Atlantic Aviation operates fixed based operations (FBOs) in 69 airports in the United States, servicing predominantly owners and operators of general aviation aircraft for corporate and leisure purposes. FBOs tend to have a high barrier to entry because airports have limited space for additional FBOs. Since 2004, Atlantic Aviation has divested 15 sites, acquired new FBOs, and only kept ones with better future prospects. 

 Source: Atlantic Aviation website In economic downturns, there will likely be higher volatility in Atlantic Aviation's business performance. However, MIC estimates that for every 10% decrease in flight volumes, free cash flow will only be reduced by 4%. Atlantic Aviation reduces risk by having FBOs in diverse locations across the U.S. with different economic drivers such that when flight activity decreases in a region, another region might see flight activity increase. Additionally, Atlantic Aviation buys fuel at a wholesale price and then sells the fuel to customers. Atlantic Aviation has little exposure to the commodity price of jet fuel because it usually carries a limited inventory of the fuel and passes fuel cost changes to customers. From 2013 to 2015, Atlantic Aviation's gross profit increased at an average rate of 12.7% and its EBITDA increased at an average rate of 18.6%. Last year, gross profit increased 13.1% to $410.2M and its EBITDA increased 21.3% to $203.6M. The higher profit was helped by acquisitions in the last 18 months. CP&E The contracted power business's primary customers are creditworthy. These customers have entered into power purchase agreements or tolling agreements for 13 to 25 years, which help stabilize the cash flows from this business. From 2013 to 2015, CP&E's gross profit increased at an average rate of 107% and its EBITDA increased at an average rate of 68.2%. Last year, gross profit increased 305% to $104.9M and its EBITDA increased 200% to $68.2M. These growth numbers are abnormally high because of divestiture and acquisition activities. For example, in August 2014, CP&E divested its 50.01% interest in a district energy business in Chicago, Illinois. As well, BEC, a gas-fired power facility in Bayonne, New Jersey, was acquired in April 2015. The following fact also might skew the perceived performance of the CP&E business. [T]he financial results … reflect 100% of the full-year performance of the solar and wind power facilities within the CP&E segment, not the contribution based on our economic interest." - Form 10K 2015 Annual Report So, it's best to observe CP&E's performance in the coming quarters instead of being caught up with 2015's financial results. At the end of 2015, CP&E had controlling interests in 6 solar power facilities (2 in Arizona, 2 in California, 1 in Texas, and 1 in Hawaii), 2 wind power facilities (in Idaho and New Mexico), and had 100% interest BEC. The Hawaii solar power facility is under development and is expected to be in service in the middle of this year. The combined facilities had the generating capacity of 779MW of which 66% was generated from BEC, 26% was from wind facilities, and 8% was from solar facilities. Hawaii Gas Hawaii Gas has been in business for over a century and is Hawaii's only government-franchised gas utility and gas distribution business. It is also one of the largest propane distribution businesses in Hawaii. Hawaii Gas operates on Hawaii's 6 major islands serving about 35,000 utility customers and 33,000 non-utility customers, and the loss of any customer will not materially affect its business. Hawaii Gas's main products include synthetic natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, and renewable natural gas. MIC acquired Hawaiian Gas in 2006 and has invested $70M in the business, such as developing gas storage capacity. 

 Source: Hawaii Gas website From 2013 to 2015, Hawaii Gas's gross profit increased at an average rate of 2.36% and its EBITDA increased at an average rate of 4.5%. Last year, gross profit increased 1.7% to $76.9M and its EBITDA increased 5.4% to $60.1M. Distribution and its growth At under $66, Macquarie Infrastructure yields 7%. It has increased its dividend for 6 consecutive years and 10 consecutive quarters. Its 3-year distribution growth rate is 36.2%. While that might jump out to some investors, its last quarterly dividend was "only" 12.7% higher than a year before. Shareholders may be concerned about the high fees paid to MIC's external manager in the sense that more paid to the manager implies less paid to shareholders in distributions. However, a portion of the manager's payment is based on the performance of the stock. So, it could be viewed as a win-win situation for the manager and other shareholders. With MIC's pipeline of growth projects and assuming its businesses continue to deliver stable performances, MIC targets to pay out distribution per share [DPS] of $5-$5.10 this year. Taking the midpoint of that, it would be a growth of 16.6% from 2015's DPS of $4.33. Macquarie Infrastructure's distribution could consist of dividends or return of capital, and it intends to pay out 75-85% of its free cash flow as distributions. Its 2015 payout ratio was 76%. Interested investors should check out MIC's website for the tax information on its distribution. The Manager and its implications Macquarie Infrastructure is managed externally by Macquarie Infrastructure Management [USA] Inc, a member of Macquarie Group based in Sydney, Australia, a global leader in managing infrastructure investment vehicles on behalf of third-party investors. Macquarie Infrastructure's manager gets a monthly base management fee based primarily on Macquarie Infrastructure's market cap, and potentially a quarterly performance fee based on the stock performance relative to a U.S. utility index. Specifically, the performance fee is 20% of the difference between the benchmark return and the return for MIC's shareholders. The default method of settling both base management and performance fees is through the reinvestment of the fees in shares. When reinvestment occurs, more shares may be issued, which translates to shareholder dilution. As usual, when more shares are issued, it only benefits shareholders if the capital put back into the business generates good returns. From 2014 to 2015, the base management fee was 52% higher, increasing from $46.6M to $70.6M and the performance fees were 134% higher, increasing from $121.5M to $284.4M. As of February 22, 2016, the external manager held 6.97% of Macquarie Infrastructure's outstanding shares. If it chooses to sell any of those shares, it may be viewed as a negative signal by the market. In the event our Manager chooses not to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares, the amount paid will reduce the cash that may otherwise be distributed as a dividend to all shareholders or used in our Company's operations. In the event our Manager chooses to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional shares, effectively returning the cash to us, such reinvestment and the issuance of new shares will dilute existing shareholders by the increase in the percentage of shares owned by our Manager. - Form 10K 2015 Annual Report The manager also placed two of its employees as the CEO and CFO of MIC. It can remove the CEO or CFO without any notice, and the manager can even resign with 90 days notice. If either of these events happened, it would likely disrupt MIC's operations because MIC would quickly need to look for suitable replacements. My other concern as a potential investor is that the external management might make decisions with a focus on short-term results instead of long-term sustainable results due to the performance fees. Only time will tell whether that holds true or not. Why has MIC underperformed recently? Macquarie Infrastructure's underperformance compared to the SPY since October 2015 may have to do with the following factors. 

 Source: Google Finance In early October, MIC announced multiple investments, including Atlantic Aviation's FBO investment in Salt Lake City and CP&E's $6M solar power projects in Hawaii. Then, in January 2016, MIC announced growth projects of $115M across its four businesses. New investments are made to create future value, but there's always risk involved regarding whether the projects will progress and work as expected. So usually, when an acquisition or investment is made, the stock would fall. MIC's 18% fall in share price in February was believed to be due to an erroneous online article that led investors to believe that MIC's Q4 2015 dividend was reduced. As soon as MIC corrected the news, its share price started recovering immediately. Additionally, MIC's slowing distribution growth may be a concern to shareholders. The table below displays MIC's quarterly distribution per share and its growth rate.          DPS DGR   Q1 2015 $1.02 -   Q2 2015 $1.07 +4.9%   Q3 2015 $1.11 +3.7%   Q4 2015 $1.13 +1.8%   Q1 2016 $1.15 +1.77%   However, I think DPS growth should be viewed at least on a year over year basis and not on a quarterly basis because quarterly results can be affected by seasonality and other short-term factors. Conclusion With a pipeline of more than $200M in approved growth projects of which the majority is expected to complete in 2016, it looks like Macquarie Infrastructure is poised for continued growth. In fact, MIC targets distributions per share to be 16.6% higher than in 2015. 

 The shares are priced at a 15% discount based on its normal multiple, and its above-average 7% yield is also compelling. Before investing, there are several concerns to think about. Concerns include the fact that MIC relies on its external manager which is likely pricier than if the company were managed internally, and the manager could pretty much resign and take the CEO and CFO with it if the manager so wishes. There's also the possibility that the manager would favor short-term growth (instead of long-term sustainable growth) due to performance-based fees based on short-term performance. At the same time, the performance fees might motivate the manager to achieve more in a shorter time period. Only time will tell if this is a real concern or not. 

 Source: Google Finance Another concern is that MIC may be more sensitive to recessions than the market as shown in the 10-year graph compared to the SPY. Particularly, investors should compare MIC's price and SPY's price in 2008-2009. However, since then, MIC has made new investments and improved its business. So, it should be better prepared for the next recession. Share in the comments below!  Which other company are you considering for a 7% yield?

IMTT is an industry leader in bulk liquids terminalling
International-Matex Tank Terminals (IMTT) is an industry leader in the handling and storage of bulk liquid products through its ownership and operation of ten terminals in the US and two additional facilities in Canada. The terminals handle petroleum (primarily refined), chemical, and vegetable and animal oil products for customers including refiners, commodities traders and specialty chemical manufacturers. Customers retain ownership of the bulk liquids, as well as responsibility for insuring those products. IMTT is the lessor of its more than 45 million barrels of storage capacity.
Bulk liquid storage terminals provide an essential link in the supply chain for major commodities such as refined petroleum products, basic and specialized chemicals and agricultural liquids. In addition to renting storage tanks, IMTT generates revenue by offering ancillary services including product transfer (throughput), heating and blending.  Pricing for storage and other services typically reflect local supply and demand as well as the specific attributes of each terminal including access to deepwater berths and connections to land-based infrastructure such as roads, pipelines and rail.

History[edit]
The company took its name from Macquarie Bank, which took its name from Lachlan Macquarie, who was Governor of New South Wales. One of his achievements includes the establishment of Australia's first bank and introduction of its first domestic coinage in 1813, the Holey dollar.
