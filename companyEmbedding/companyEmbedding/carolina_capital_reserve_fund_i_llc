About us - Carolina Capital Reserve Fund

























































































 


 



















About usHome About us






The Manager of the Fund is Carolina Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. CCM will also represent the Note Holders as the Note Holder Representative. The members of CCM are initially Big Brother, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company, whose principal is William (“Bill”) Fairman, Little Sister, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company, whose principal is Wendy Sweet, and Fairway America Fund VII LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“FA Fund VII”). The Originator is Carolina Hard Money LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company (“CHM”). The principals of CHM are Wendy Sweet and Bill Fairman.
Wendy Sweet and Bill Fairman (brother and sister) started Carolina Hard Money LLC in 2012. Having both worked in the mortgage business for a long time but never together, we felt the timing was finally right. In the aftermath of the credit crunch, banks no longer have much of an appetite for loans with any sort of construction component. Wendy, with her residential rehab experience, and Bill, with his commercial mortgage experience, thought that the timing couldn’t be better to fill that void in the Carolinas where they both hail from and have worked for many years. They have a combined 45 years of experience in the mortgage lending industry.
FA Fund VII is a newly created partnership that was formed to acquire a variety of real estate asset backed investments in various forms including security instruments in other 506 Regulation D funds, ownership of real property, and debt secured by real property, in target markets around the United States. The General Partner of FA Fund VII is Fairway America Management Group II LLC. Fairway America, LLC (“Fairway”), one of the key principals of the General Partner, is an experienced and long-time fund manager, and has successfully procured and deployed several hundred million dollars in private money between its several proprietary funds as well as multiple smaller funds and individual whole loan investors. Over the past twenty years, Fairway has started, operated, and concluded multiple funds and has either funded, brokered, and/or serviced nearly 1,000 small balance commercial real estate loans, totaling in excess of $400,000,000. Since late 2011, Fairway has leveraged its extensive experience and track record to become the nation’s premier real estate asset based 506 Regulation D fund consulting, advisory, and investment firm specializing in the business planning, creation, capital raising strategy, and third party administration of private money pooled mortgage and other real estate asset based funds around the United States.

Capital “Reserve” Fund?

Posted by South Carolina Policy Council on Thursday, March 14, 2013 ·  




SINCE WHEN DOES ‘RESERVE’ MEAN ‘SLUSH’?
As has become a yearly tradition, legislators have voted to raid the Capital Reserve Fund to funnel money to their own pet projects.
The purpose of the Fund is to finance previously authorized capital improvement bond projects and to retire interest or principal on previous bonds. Each year, the state constitution mandates that it be appropriated 2 percent of the previous year’s General Fund Revenue. However, a provision in the constitution allows the Fund to be used for “other nonrecurring purposes,” and lawmakers have used that phrase as license to raid the fund for all manner of things that have nothing to do with capital improvements.
The meaning of this third provision – much like the Commerce Clause and General Welfare clause in the U.S. Constitution – has been expanded well beyond its original intentions. Capital projects are supposed to be large, necessary projects.
For example, of the roughly $112.6 million appropriated to the fund this year, $5.3 million is given to the Deal Closing Fund. This fund, which is used to hand out tax dollars to specific companies to “lure” them to the state, was given a total of $25 million last year—$8 million in recurring funds, $7 million from the indecipherable Part 1B, and $10 million from the Mortgage Settlement Fund.
This year’s Fund also appropriates $3 million for the state Farmers Market, $2,950,000 more than it was funded in last year’s Capital Reserve Fund bill. A fund reserved for capital projects is designed to fund long-term, large-scale, necessary improvements – roads, bridges, refurbishments of prisons, DMV offices, or other government buildings – not to prop up failed, costly ventures when those ventures run through their originally allotted budget.
Below are just a few more items in the Capital Reserve Fund that seem questionable at best.

$1.5 million Cadet Accountability system for The Citadel.
$20.1 million for the Department of Revenue to repay a loan from hacking incident.
$7.5 million for the CATT Program/ReadySC – a program designed to provide workforce training for companies.
$5.5 million for a System-wide Infrastructure and Workforce Development for State Board of Technical and Comprehensive Education
$3 million Clemson University-PSA Advanced Plant Technology Lab.
$1 million Business Incubator Program.

The General Assembly routinely uses the Capital Reserve Fund to give these types of appropriations on years when they don’t have to use the fund to fill in General Fund deficits. The word “Reserve” in Capital Reserve Fund is apparently meaningless to legislators since every year they build up the fund and raid all of it in the same year. This fund should be what its title implies – a reserve fund – and should only be used to spend on actual capital projects, and only when there is some semblance of immediate necessity.
A bill has been proposed in the Senate, S.111, that would propose an amendment to eliminate “other recurring purposes” from the Capital Reserve Fund appropriations criteria. That would at least have the merit of preventing this “reserve” fund from being used as, in effect, a slush fund.
An additional point: If there are really no legitimate and immediately necessary capital projects to be undertaken in a given fiscal year, or at least if such projects haven’t taken all the previous year’s appropriation to the Capital Reserve Fund, that money should be returned to the taxpayer. If the General Assembly has taken more money from taxpayers than is required to run the state, they have a moral obligation – not a legal one but at least a moral obligation – to return it to the people who produced it in the first place.

I am a board of director for an HOA in SC.  I am trying to find out if reserve funds can be used for capital improvements for common areas.  There is no mention of reserve funds in any of our governing documents.  Does anyone know if this is allowed in SC?   Carole

I have a question for you.   What is your understanding of what "reserve funds" CAN be used for?   














CaroleL(South Carolina)Posts:11



05/21/2010 12:38 PM

							
							
							 
					


My understanding is that they are for repairs to the common areas, ex. repairing a fence, but I am not sure if improvements to the common areas are also included.  I have seen some definitions of reserve fund include capital improvements for other states.  SC does not have any HOA laws, a bill is pending, but there is nothing right now.  Since our governing docs do not reference reserve funds at all, I am unsure of what the definiton is in SC.  The reason I am asking is that our HOA has a pond but the only access to it is through swampy water.  So, I am wondering if we can use reserve funds to build a boardwalk and small dock area so that homeowners can fish in the pond.

I don't know if it is allowed in SC but I would think not.   Usually, reserve funding is guided by a reserve study.  The reserve study specifies in detail what "action items" the reserve funds are for.  An "action item" would include both a verb and an object and a time period.  For example, "repaint the fence on 12th Street every 5 years".  If something is not in the reserve study, the reserves would not be used to pay for it.  Chances are that capital improvements are not anticipated and not included in the reserve study.

IMO you can't use the funds to build the boardwalk and small dock but only to repair or replace it after it exists. Better to do a special assessment to fund it; once you start playing with the reserves it is too easy to use those funds.

There is no mention of reserve funds in any of our governing documents.  Does anyone know if this is allowed in SC? Carole If there are no restrictions in the Covenants or state law I think you can. Whether or not to do so may require association approval unless your governing documents delegate the authority to the Board of Directors.

Reserve funds are not for repair, they are for replacement of common elements.

Gerald,   Wrong!  They are for "major" repair and replacement.  Sometimes there's a fine line between repair and "major" repair but it's up to the BOD to decide which to apply and whether or not to use the reserve monies.  If reserve funds were to be used only for replacement then assn's with private streets could not resurface those streets (a major repair) using reserve funds.

South Carolina Code 11-11-320. Capital Reserve Fund


																							
											Current as of: 2016 | 				
										
											Check for updates									
									 | 		
											Other versions




(A) The General Assembly, in the annual general appropriations act, shall appropriate, out of the estimated revenue of the general fund for the fiscal year for which the appropriations are made, into a Capital Reserve Fund, which is separate and distinct from the General Reserve Fund, an amount equal to two percent of the general fund revenue of the latest completed fiscal year.
(B) This appropriation must be contained in the Ways and Means Committee report on the general appropriations bill, the general appropriations bill at the time of third reading in the House of Representatives, the Senate Finance Committee report on the general appropriations bill, the general appropriations bill at the time of a third reading in the Senate, and in any conference report on the general appropriations bill.
Terms Used In South Carolina Code 11-11-320appropriation: The provision of funds, through an annual appropriations act or a permanent law, for federal agencies to make payments out of the Treasury for specified purposes. The formal federal spending process consists of two sequential steps: authorizationconference report: The compromise product negotiated by the conference committee. The "conference report" is submitted to each chamber for its consideration, such as approval or disapproval.fiscal year: The fiscal year is the accounting period for the government. For the federal government, this begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. The fiscal year is designated by the calendar year in which it ends; for example, fiscal year 2006 begins on October 1, 2005 and ends on September 30, 2006.(C) Revenues in the Capital Reserve Fund only may be used in the following manner:
(1) In any fiscal year in which the General Reserve Fund does not maintain the percentage amount required by Section 11-11-310, monies from the Capital Reserve Fund first must be used, to the extent necessary, to fully replenish the requisite percentage amount in the General Reserve Fund. The Capital Reserve Fund’s replenishment of the General Reserve Fund is in addition to the replenishment requirement provided in Section 36(A), Article III of the Constitution of this State. After the General Reserve Fund is fully restored to the requisite percentage, the monies in the Capital Reserve Fund may be appropriated pursuant to item (2) of this subsection. The Capital Reserve Fund may not be used to offset a midyear budget reduction.
(2) Subsequent to appropriations required by item (1), monies from the Capital Reserve Fund may be appropriated by the General Assembly in separate legislation upon an affirmative vote in each branch of the General Assembly by two-thirds of the members present and voting but not less than three-fifths of the total membership in each branch for the following purposes:
(a) to finance in cash previously authorized capital improvement bond projects;
(b) to retire interest or principal on bonds previously issued;
(c) for capital improvements or other nonrecurring purposes.
(D)(1) Any appropriation of monies from the Capital Reserve Fund as provided in subsection (C) of this section must be ranked in priority of expenditure and is effective on September first of the following fiscal year. If it is determined that the fiscal year has ended with an operating deficit, then the monies appropriated from the Capital Reserve Fund must be reduced by the State Budget and Control Board based on the rank of priority, beginning with the lowest priority, to the extent necessary and applied by the board to the year-end operating deficit before withdrawing monies from the General Reserve Fund.
(2) At the end of the fiscal year, any monies in the Capital Reserve Fund that are not appropriated as provided in subsection (C) of this section or any appropriation for a particular project or item which has been reduced due to application of the monies to a year-end deficit must lapse and be credited to the General Fund.

UPDATE: Surplus, Capital Reserve, Sine Die, Uber

Posted by South Carolina Policy Council on Friday, June 19, 2015 ·  


 
SESSION IS OVER … ALMOST
The third week in June ended on a tragic note in the General Assembly, and attention has rightly been away from legislative business. In the interests of keeping tabs on the legislature, however, here’s a summary of the main business at present.
Supplemental appropriations bill 
The House passed a supplemental appropriations bill on Wednesday determining what to do with a surplus of $400 million divided between recurring and non-recurring revenue. Some of the $415 million was pre-committed to education, but lawmakers have discretion over roughly $300 million of the surplus.
Some notable expenditures in the House supplemental appropriations bill include:

$145.8 million to county transportation committees, or CTCs, for the repair and maintenance of state owned secondary roads.
$23.5 million for a state employee one-time bonus ($800 for every employee employed for more than 6 months and earning less than $100,000).
$70 million for “economic development infrastructure” – i.e. to build an interchange for Volvo.
$16.5 million for debt service on economic development bonds (paying down some bond debt will free up more bonding capacity to finance projects such as the Volvo incentives package).

The Senate Finance Committee approved a different version of the bill Wednesday, which the full Senate approved on Thursday. The Senate version of the legislation increases the share of the surplus going to CTCs to $216 million. The Senate achieved this increase by cutting other proposed expenditures, including child support enforcement at the Department of Social Services, medical assistance payment case services at the Department of Health and Human Services, appropriations to the homestead exemption fund, and indigent defense.
The bill will be debated over the next several days in a conference committee alongside other budget bills.
On road funding, bear in mind: putting more money into the same unaccountable and wasteful transportation governance system without reform is unlikely to yield any significant or lasting improvements to South Carolina roads.
Capital Reserve Fund 
An amended version of the capital reserve fund passed the House on Wednesday. The most recent version of the legislation passed by the House appropriated $127 million, in contrast to the $84 million appropriated by the most recent Senate version of the bill.
Each version of the legislation appropriates a large amount of funds to higher education, but the House version focuses on this area to a greater degree than the Senate. The House legislation restores financing to a number of higher education projects for which the Senate only appropriated $1, including:

$25 million for a proposed children’s hospital at the Medical University of South Carolina. (A private donor recently gifted the same amount to MUSC for the same purpose, but that apparently doesn’t alter the university’s need for this appropriation.)
$2.5 million for repurposing of the Stern Center at the University of Charleston.
$3.5 million for renovations of the old law school at the University of South Carolina (USC) Columbia.
$5 million for a business and behavioral sciences building at Clemson University.
$5 million for the South Caroliniana Library at USC Columbia.

Despite the constant claims of poverty by state institutions of higher education, South Carolina’s principal state universities are doing just fine financially. Nor does increasing university funding seem to improve educational outcomes. In any case, many lawmakers seem determined to give the universities all or most of what their lobbyists ask for.
With different versions having passed both chambers, the CRF bill is now in conference committee.
Amending sine die
Also on Wednesday, the House passed a new sine die resolution which would permit the General Assembly to debate H.3579 during the additional session days. The House and Senate were already operating under a separate sine die resolution that restricted the matters lawmakers could debate.
The Senate adjourned Thursday under the terms of the original sine die resolution, with Senate leaders expressing little interest in considering the House resolution or debating the gas tax prior to final passage of all budget bills. However, there is no guarantee senators won’t return to this resolution or the gas tax when they return to approve conference committee reports on the multiple appropriations bills and others. Leaders in the Senate alluded to a return to Columbia next week, assuming all goes according to plan in conference committee.
It would be irresponsible of the legislature to extend session even further – increasing the taxpayer cost of the already too-lengthy session – to debate what is sure to be the largest tax increase in state history. Since the Senate has already voted put the gas tax bill on special order, the bill will be among the first debates the chamber takes up in 2016. That should settle it until next year.
‘Uber bill’ conference report adopted
The House approved the conference version of the Uber legislation by a vote of 96 to 2, and the Senate approved the conference report by a vote of 39 to 0.
The most recent version of the Uber legislation (the conference report) has been made available on the State House website; it combines almost all the negative provisions from the bill’s previous versions.
In general, the bill is a sad missed opportunity. Rather than deregulating the entire passenger carrying motor vehicle industry (including ride-sharing companies and their competitors, traditional taxis) legislators have opted to impose numerous burdensome regulations on ride-sharing companies, too, leaving them just slightly less regulated than taxis. The conference report on the Uber legislation continues this approach.
More detailed analysis by the Policy Council on the ridesharing issue and its appropriate policy solution can be found here.
