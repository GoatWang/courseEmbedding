Our Famous Produce




















Locavores love Wilson Farm! 
The term “locavore” was coined in 2005, but Wilson Farm has always believed that the best-tasting, most sustainable and nutritious foods are ones that have been grown close to home. We’ve been growing fresh, local, affordable produce for more than 130 years!
On over 500 acres of land in Lexington, MA and Litchfield, NH, we produce over 125 varieties of fruit, vegetables, and herbs. Almost everything we grow is sold within just hours of being harvested, so you know our produce is the freshest around!
Vegetables
Our stand is a celebration of the seasons, full of vibrant colors and abundant choices all year long. We have everything from artichokes to zucchini, and our meticulous staff always makes sure everything is at the peak of freshness and flavor. 
Fruit
Wilson Farm has the sweetest, most luscious fruit available anywhere! An amazing selection of citrus, berries of every color – including our own strawberries – juicy stone fruit, a huge variety of apples (even rare heirloom varieties), velvety pears, melons of every kind, and much more, plus our own fresh-squeezed juice and ready-to-eat fruit cups.
The Wilson Farm CSA
If you just can’t get enough fresh, local fruit and vegetables, joining our CSA is a great idea! You’ll receive a basket overflowing with our incredible produce every week for 18 weeks during our growing season. It’s a great way to make sure you eat your veggies – and try new produce you might not have had before. Plus you’ll get recipes, cooking tips, the inside scoop from the farm, and more!

Why Sinaloa tomatoes are the best.
I guess you could say it’s all in a name. The name Sinaloa comes from the Cahita language and is a combination of the words sina, which means pithaya (a plant with thorny stalks), and lobola, which means rounded. Hmmm...sound like a tomato?

Our FamousProduce

Simply the Best Produce Available Anywhere
















 


Vegetables
There's always a celebration of seasons, colors and flavors in the stand! Our vegetables reflect the alphabet, from artichokes to zucchini, plus:
    Tomatoes; including hothouse grown, on-the-vine clusters, cherry tomatoes, and the ever-popular grape tomatoes.
    
    Salad Greens include it all - iceberg, Italian mixes, mesclun, radicchio, endive, sprouts, spinach and more - if it's green, we've got it.
Carrots, Celery, Cucumbers, Beans, Seasonal Squashes, plus Peppers in a rainbow of colors.
Spuds, including Yukon Gold and Red Bliss.
We get misty-eyed over our Onions such as Vidalia, Spanish & Bermuda red.
Towers of Broccoli and Cauliflower sit amongst showy Snow Peas and Sugar Snap Peas.
Fruit
Our fruits are flashy because they're the very best quality available anywhere, with colors and flavors reflecting the seasons, as well as our commitment to secure the best year-round:
Bushels of Apples, Pumpkins and Pears in autumn. Warm weather brings Berries of every color, which peak with our own luscious strawberries in June. Sunshine and summer means Melons; ours are huge, juicy and in a kaleidoscope of colors and varieties. Citrus all winter, plus our own year-round fresh-squeezed juice and ready-to-eat fruit cups.
Loving Locavores
Locavores eat food grown or produced locally, believing that the best-tasting and most sustainable choices are foods that are fresh, seasonal, and grown close to home.
We meticulously farm over 500 acres of land producing over 100 different varieties of fruit, vegetables, and herbs. Much of our seasonal crop is sold within hours of being harvested. 
While the word "Locavore" was coined in 2005, Wilson Farm has understood the value of locally grown produce since 1884.
Our family eats our harvest, we hope yours will too.

Gorgeous Antidote to City Living
3/18/2006

Alison P.


                        Cooped up too long in your little apartment?  Unable to bear any more cement?  Head out to Wilson Farms for some sensory nature overload.  It's a real, working farm and its products are inside.  Under the outside tent are incredible flower displays in the summer and pies and pumpkins (and exotic flowers such as Japanese lanterns) in the fall.  The place can be crazy on weekends and especially right before holidays, so go early if you can to avoid Shopper Rage.  Good prices here when something is really in its season, like apples in fall and strawberries in summer.  There's a bakery on premises and you can sometimes find still-warm loaves at the back of the store.  It is not cheap to shop here in general, but you're supporting a local business and the experience makes it a treat once in a while.  They also have meat, a good cheese selection, and some premade foods ready to go.

Barn full of groceries
2/5/2006

w j c.


                        Wilson Farms is a grocery store like no other in the area. It has the best selection fresh produce, cut flowers and imported gourmet cheeses. You can also pick up one of their already-prepared take home meals that are expertly fabricated from food grown or produced on the premises.

Also excellent at Wilson Farms is their large green house with many plants available for purchase. Prices are a little high, but can be expected with the uncompromised quality.

                        If you are looking for a feast of the senses, this is the place to go. Some of the best produce I have found in the area all arranged in large colorful piles and they have everything imaginable. Fruits vegetables, herbs and fresh flowers, plants and bushes. In addition, they also sell meats/chicken, baked goods, eggs, cheeses, take home meals and snacks. For every holiday the have decorations for sale (pumpkins and fall decorations and Christmas trees/ wreaths etc...) the parking lot is ALWAYS full and when you shop there, you will know why.

Great local store for fresh groceries
9/27/2005

Jodi G.


                        Wilson Farms is located in Lexington, MA and is easily the best place around for fresh groceries.  This store, which gets very crowded on weekend afternoons, sells loads of fresh fruits and veggies, has a bakery, gourmet cheese section, and sells fresh pasta.  The produce cannot be beat and the prices, while a little high, are still reasonable.

Great Fresh Produce

                        Wilson Farm has the most amazingly fresh produce. They also have specialty foods and prepared foods. The bakery items are amazing. They sell fresh flowers that are stunning. They also sell seasonal items, such as pumpkins in the fall and Christmas trees and wreaths around the holidays.

Market for Fresh Produce
8/20/2005

J. W.


                        This is the real thing.  Fresh, farm-grown fruits and vegetables from a real farm!  

The quality and freshness are unbelievable and the employees are uniformly helpful and conversant about the different types of produce they sell.  

The place is terribly crowded on weekends (and finding a parking spot becomes a major challenge!), especially during the summer months when gardeners converge to shop for plants and other gardening paraphernalia.

Fresh veggies, garden plants and so much more
8/18/2005

Alexis B.


                        Locally owned and growing since 1884, Wilson Farms offers "foodies" a great place to explore fresh and local produce, meats and dairy products.  The gardener can explore Wilson Farms garden center and greenhouse for the latest in beautiful house plants, flowers and equipment.  Wilson Farms staff is another bonus as they are pleasant, knowledgeable and offer countless tips and advice to their shoppers.  The produce is priced slightly higher than local grocery chains but its quality is worth it.  You can feel confident shopping here, preparing the food and serving it to your family.

Better than Whole Foods-quality produce, at Star Market prices
4/26/2005

Jess B.


                        Wilson Farm is a family-run farm stand/store in Lexington.  But it's a lot more.  Stocking produce year-round from purveyors across the country (where else do they add labels next to each fruit telling you where it came from?), Wilson Farms has become my go-to store for all our fruits and vegetables.  Their prices are reasonable -- often less than you'd pay at Star Market or Stop and Shop -- and the quality of their produce can put even Whole Foods to shame.

Parking on the weekends can be a nightmare -- I like to show up around 6:30 p.m. on Sunday and miss the rush.  

In addition to produce, Wilson Farms has great flowers, plants and shrubs in the summer, and even a real barn area where kids can go and see (maybe even pet?) the animals.  My favorite time of year is fall, when they have homemade cider donuts, fresh-pressed cider, and a pile of pumpkins that would make the Great Pumpkin blush.
