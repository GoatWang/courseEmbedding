PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

To measure a money market fund's performance, you can look at either total      
return or yield. Total return reflects the change in a fund's share price       
over a given period,  and reinvestment of its dividends (or income). Yield      
measures the income paid by a fund. Since a money market fund tries to          
maintain a $1 share price, yield is an important measure of performance. If

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms        
over a set period - in this case, one year, five years or ten years. For        
example, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return over the         
past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050. To measure how the     
fund's performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare it to the      
average all taxable money market fund, which reflects the performance of        
741 taxable money market funds with similar objectives tracked by               
IBC/Donoghue over the past 12 months. Comparing the fund's performance to       
the consumer price index (CPI) helps show how your fund did compared to         
inflation. (The periods covered by the CPI and IBC/Donoghue numbers are the     
closest available match to those covered by the fund.)

YIELD refers to the income paid by the fund over a given period. Yields for     
money market funds are usually for seven-day periods, expressed as annual       
percentage rates. A yield that assumes income earned is reinvested or           
compounded is called an effective yield. The chart above shows the fund's       
current seven-day yield at quarterly intervals over the past year. You can      
compare these yields to the average all taxable money market fund and the       
average bank money market deposit account (MMDA). Figures for the average       
all taxable money market fund

There are some important differences between                                    
a bank money market deposit account (MMDA)                                      
and a money market fund. First, the U.S.                                        
government neither insures nor guarantees a                                     
money market fund. In fact, there is no                                         
assurance that a money market fund will                                         
maintain a $1 share price. Second, a money                                      
market fund returns to its shareholders income                                  
earned by the fund's investments after                                          
expenses. This is in contrast to banks, which                                   
set their MMDA rates periodically based on                                      
current interest rates, competitors' rates, and                                 
internal criteria.

Q. BURNIE, HOW DID THE CASH PORTFOLIO PERFORM?                                  
A. The fund's seven-day yield on June 30, 1995 was 5.70%, compared to 4.02%     
a year ago. For the year ended June 30, 1995, the fund's total return was       
5.28%. That compares favorably with the average total return of 4.99%           
during the same period for the average all taxable money market funds,          
according to IBC/Donoghue.                                                      
Q. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT?                    
A. We haven't seen such a dramatic shift in the middle of the fund's fiscal     
year since the late 1980s. Throughout the second half of 1994, everything       
the Federal Reserve did was designed to slow down the pace of economic          
growth and prevent an outbreak of inflation. As recently as the fourth          
quarter of 1994, when growth surged ahead at an annual rate of more than        
5%, it looked as if the Fed still had a lot of work to do. But then very        
quickly we began to see signs of weakness throughout the economy. The           
first-quarter 1995 growth rate was slightly above the Fed's                     
non-inflationary trend rate of 2.5%, but there was no denying that the          
economy had slowed down dramatically. In fact, by early summer, some            
economists were speculating that the Fed had overshot its goal of a soft        
landing for the economy, and began to have concerns that an extended            
downturn could lead to a recession.                                             
Q. WHAT KIND OF STRATEGIC ADJUSTMENTS DID YOU MAKE DURING THE PERIOD?           
A. As long as the economy was heating up and the Fed was raising interest       
rates, I positioned the fund very defensively. My aim was to keep pace with     
current rates and maintain as much flexibility as I could. By the end of        
December, the fund's average maturity was around 25 days. Later in the          
period, as signs of economic weakness accumulated and prospects for an          
eventual Fed rate cut improved, I began buying longer-term securities and       
gradually extending the fund's average maturity. By the end of June, I had      
the fund out around 55 days.                                                    
Q. GIVEN THE CURRENT RATE ENVIRONMENT, DO YOU HAVE PLANS TO EXTEND THE          
FUND'S AVERAGE MATURITY FURTHER IN THE MONTHS AHEAD?                            
A. I would characterize the fund's average maturity at the end of the           
period as being toward the aggressive side of neutral. If I thought we were     
headed for a recession, I might want to extend the fund further, but that       
seems unlikely. Among the historical prerequisites for a recession are high     
inflation, tight credit conditions and an inverted yield curve, with            
longer-term securities yielding less than shorter-term securities. None of      
those conditions currently apply. The upshot is, while I may want to extend     
the fund slightly, I probably won't go much beyond 60 days until the            
economic picture becomes clearer.

PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate a fund's historical performance. You can     
look at the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage     
change, or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Each figure         
includes changes in a fund's share price, plus reinvestment of any              
dividends (or income) and capital gains (the profits the fund earns when it     
sells bonds that have grown in value). You can also look at the fund's          
income to measure performance. If Fidelity had not reimbursed certain           
expenses, the past 5 years and life of fund total returns would have been       
lower.

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage terms        
over a set period - in this case, one year, five years, or since the fund       
started on March 19, 1987. For example, if you invested $1,000 in a fund        
that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your investment would     
be $1,050. You can compare the fund's returns to the performance of the         
Salomon Brothers 12-Month T-Bill Index - a broad measure of the performance     
of short-term treasury bills. To measure how the fund's performance stacked     
up against its peers, you can compare it to the average short U. S.             
government bond fund, which reflects the performance of 35 funds with           
similar objectives tracked by Lipper Analytical Services over the past 12       
months. These benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if     
any. Comparing the fund's performance to the consumer price index (CPI)         
helps show how your fund did compared to inflation. (The CPI returns begin      
on the month end closest to the fund's start date.)

$10,000 OVER LIFE OF FUND:  Let's say you invested $10,000 in North             
Carolina Term Portfolio on March 31, 1987, shortly after the fund started.      
As the chart shows, by June 30, 1995, the value of your investment would        
have grown to $16,556 - a 65.56% increase on your initial investment. For       
comparison, look at how the Salomon Brothers 12-Month Treasury Bill Index       
did over the same period. With dividends reinvested, the same $10,000           
investment would have grown to $16,911 -                                        
a 69.11% increase.                                                              

UNDERSTANDING

How a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of                                     
how it will do tomorrow. Bond prices, for                                       
example, generally move in the opposite                                         
direction of interest rates. In turn, the share                                 
price, return, and yield of a fund that invests in                              
bonds will vary. That means if you sell your                                    
shares during a market downturn, you might                                      
lose money. But if you can ride out the                                         
market's ups and downs, you may have a gain.

DIVIDEND returns and capital appreciation returns are both part of a bond       
fund's total return. A dividend return reflects the actual dividends paid       
by the fund. A capital appreciation return reflects both the amount paid by     
the fund to shareholders as capital gain distributions and changes in the       
fund's share price. Both returns assume the dividends or gains are              
reinvested.

DIVIDENDS per share show the income paid by the fund for a set period. If       
you annualize this number, based on an average share price of $9.91 over        
the past month, $9.87 over the past six months and $9.86 over the past          
year, you can compare the fund's income over these three periods. The           
30-day annualized YIELD is a standard formula for all                           
funds based on the yields of the bonds in the fund, averaged over the past      
30 days. This figure shows you the yield characteristics of the fund's          
investments at the end of the period. It also helps you compare funds from      
different companies on an equal basis.

Q. BOB, HOW DID THE TERM PORTFOLIO PERFORM?                                     
A. Not as well as I would have liked. Although the fund had a decent first      
half of the year, the overall results were disappointing. That's because        
the fund was positioned too conservatively while the bond market was            
rallying during the last six months of its fiscal year. For the 12 months       
ended June 30, 1995, the fund's total return was 5.87%. That was less than      
the 6.66% total return for the Salomon Brothers 12-month Treasury Bill          
Index. Going forward, I'll be measuring the fund's performance more closely     
against this index, which is a representation of the 12-month Treasury bill     
market. My goal will continue to be to generate returns that are better         
than the 12-month Treasury bill market as a whole, while attempting to          
dampen relative volatility.                                                     
Q. HOW HAS THE INTEREST-RATE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED SINCE THE PERIOD BEGAN?        
A. The difference is like night and day. A year ago, the Federal Reserve        
was still aggressively pursuing a policy designed to slow down the pace of      
economic growth and prevent an outbreak of inflation. The rate on the           
one-year Treasury Bill was rising steadily along with the Fed's primary         
tool for carrying out its monetary policy, the federal funds rate, which is     
the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. By the end of 1994 -      
the halfway point in the fund's fiscal year - the one-year Treasury was         
yielding 7.16%. There was still one more rate increase to come, in              
February, but since then, as the economy has slowed down, rates have fallen     
sharply. Several factors have fueled the rally, including continued             
deterioration in the economy; a stable U.S. dollar, which has encouraged        
foreign investors to become more active in the U.S. market; and lately,         
aggressive buying on the part of market participants who had stayed on the      
sidelines during the early stages of the rally. By the end of June, the         
one-year Treasury was yielding 5.63%.                                           
Q. HOW DID YOUR STRATEGY CHANGE?                                                
A. The fund's average maturity for much of the period was less than one         
year. That was an advantage as long as interest rates were rising and bond      
prices were falling. It quickly became a disadvantage once rates started        
moving the other way in February 1995 and bond prices rose. As rates have       
continued falling, I've taken steps in recent months to extend the fund's       
average maturity to closer to one year.                                         
Q. WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK FOR THE REST OF 1995?                                     
A. It's clear that the pace of economic activity has slowed markedly.           
During the first quarter of 1995, the gross domestic product grew at an         
annual rate of 2.7%, compared to 5.1% during the fourth quarter of 1994. By     
the end of June, economists were predicting a second-quarter 1995 growth        
rate of less than 1%, and speculation centered on when the Fed might cut        
rates. As we all know by now, the Fed did cut the federal funds rate            
one-quarter percentage point on July 6, shortly after the period ended.         
While the Fed may not be through cutting yet, the economy has shown signs       
of unexpected strength lately; housing has improved slightly and consumer       
confidence appears to be rising. Given the uncertain outlook, I'd probably      
rather have the added flexibility that comes with an average maturity of        
slightly less than one year.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
Cash Portfolio and Term Portfolio (the funds) are funds of The North            
Carolina Capital Management Trust (the trust). The trust is registered          
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an      
open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts             
business trust. Shares of the trust are offered exclusively to local            
governments and public authorities of the State of North Carolina. Each         
fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares. The following        
summarizes the significant accounting policies of the funds:                    
SECURITY VALUATION.                                                             
CASH PORTFOLIO. As permitted under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, and certain       
conditions therein, securities are valued initially at cost and thereafter      
assume a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium.          
TERM PORTFOLIO. Securities are valued based upon a computerized matrix          
system and/or appraisals by a pricing service, both of which consider           
market transactions and dealer-supplied valuations. Short-term securities       
maturing within sixty days of their purchase date are valued either at          
amortized cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both of which            
approximate current value. Securities for which quotations are not readily      
available through the pricing service are valued at their fair value as         
determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures under the        
general supervision of the Board of Trustees.                                   
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter      
M of the Internal Revenue Code, each fund is not subject to income taxes to     
the extent that it distributes substantially all of its taxable income for      
the fiscal year. The schedules of investments include information regarding     
income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."
INVESTMENT INCOME.                                                              
CASH PORTFOLIO. Interest income, which includes amortization of premium and     
accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as earned.                     
TERM PORTFOLIO. Interest income, which includes accretion of original issue     
discount, is accrued as earned.                                                 
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.      
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the        
funds in the trust.                                                             
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS.                                                  
CASH PORTFOLIO. Dividends are declared daily and paid monthly from net          
interest income.                                                                
TERM PORTFOLIO. Distributions are declared daily and                            
paid monthly from net interest income. Distributions                            
to shareholders from realized gains on investments,                             
if any, are recorded on the ex-dividend date.                                   
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with         
income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting      
principles. These differences, which may result in distribution                 
reclassifications, are primarily due to differing treatments for capital        
loss carryforwards and losses deferred due to excise tax regulations. Term      
Portfolio also utilized earnings and profits distributed to shareholders on     
redemption of shares as a part of the dividends paid deduction for income       
tax purposes.                                                                   
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital and may       
affect the per-share allocation between net investment income (loss) and        
realized and unrealized gain (loss). Undistributed net investment income        
and accumulated undistributed net realized gain (loss) on investments may       
include temporary book and tax basis differences which will reverse in a        
subsequent period. Distributions in excess of net investment income and         
accumulated undistributed net realized gain (loss) on investments may           
include temporary book and tax basis differences that will reverse in a         
subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining at fiscal year end      
is distributed in the following year.                                           
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the funds, along with other       
affiliated entities of Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR), may        
transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more joint trading accounts.      
These balances are invested in one or more repurchase agreements that           
mature in 60 days or less from the date of purchase, and are collateralized     
by U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                                 
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The funds, through their custodian, receive delivery     
of the underlying U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency Securities, the market        
value of which is  required to be at least equal to the repurchase price.       
For term repurchase agreement transactions, the underlying securities are       
marked-to-market daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the          
repurchase price.  The funds' investment adviser,  FMR, is responsible for      
determining that the value of the underlying securities remains in              
accordance with the market value requirements stated above.                     
3. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.                                          
TERM PORTFOLIO. Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term        
securities, aggregated $19,847,656 and $19,683,594 respectively.                
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As each fund's investment adviser,                              
FMR pays all expenses, except the compensation of the non-interested            
Trustees and certain exceptions such as interest, taxes, brokerage              
commissions and extraordinary expenses.                                         
FMR receives a fee that is based upon a graduated series of rates ranging       
from .38% to .41% of each fund's average net assets. For the period the         
management fees paid to FMR were equivalent to an annualized rate of .39%       
and .41% for the Cash and Term Portfolios, respectively.                        
SUB-ADVISER FEE. As Cash Portfolio's investment sub-adviser, FMR Texas          
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR, receives a fee from FMR of 50% of       
the management fee payable to FMR. The fee is paid prior to any voluntary       
expense reimbursements which may be in effect, and after reducing the fee       
for any payments by FMR pursuant to the fund's Distribution and Service         
Plan.                                                                           
DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN. Pursuant to the Distribution and Service         
Plans (the Plans), and in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act, FMR       
pays Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), an affiliate of FMR, a            
distribution and service fee that is based on a graduated series of rates       
ranging from .14% to .17% of each fund's average net assets. For the            
period, FMR paid FDC $2,361,376 and $91,592 on behalf of the Cash and the       
Term Portfolios, respectively, all of which FDC paid to Sterling Capital        
Distributors, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sterling Capital               
Management Company.                                                             
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                                               

To the Trustees and Shareholders of                                             
The North Carolina Capital Management Trust:                                    
Cash Portfolio and Term Portfolio:                                              

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of        
The North Carolina Capital Management Trust (comprised of the Cash              
Portfolio and the Term Portfolio), including the schedules of portfolio         
investments, as of June 30, 1995, and the related statements of operations      
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each       
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for     
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements     
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management.      
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements       
and financial highlights based on our audits.                                   
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and          
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of            
securities owned as of June 30,1995 by correspondence with the custodian        
and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles         
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating        
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits        
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                                     
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred      
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position       
of the respective aforementioned Portfolios comprising The North Carolina       
Capital Management Trust as of June 30, 1995, the results of their              
operations for the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for         
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial               
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in              
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Easily access high-quality real estate deals.
High Returns
LendingHome’s high-yield real estate assets have returns that range from 8% to 10%. We fund all of our loans before they become available to you as investments, so you start earning interest from the very first day you invest.
Backed by Real Assets
We source creditworthy real estate professionals looking for short-term mortgages of 12 months or less to be used for purchasing and rehabilitating homes. These mortgages are backed by the underlying value of the properties that they fund.
Institutional Quality
You can access the same mortgage platform trusted by some of the largest credit funds in the world. Our credit guidelines have been fully vetted by our institutional investors, and we do an in-depth analysis of each mortgage.
Build a Diversified Portfolio With the Click of a Button
Our online platform makes it easy to build a diverse real estate portfolio. The AutoInvest feature can do the work for you, spreading out your investment across a variety of fractional notes based on your preferences. Or, customize your portfolio by selecting individual loans on your own.
Easy Access
Individuals can access LendingHome’s opportunities with as little as $5,000 per investment and none of the fees of traditional real estate investing. Once you’ve built a portfolio, you’ll get on-demand updates on its performance.



"Unlike other FinTech platforms that offer investments backed by unsecured loans, LendingHome provides an opportunity to participate in the market for senior secured, collateralized mortgage loans backed by real assets."

Founder and managing partner,
Aesalon Capital Management LLC
