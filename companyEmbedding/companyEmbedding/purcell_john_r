			Mr. Purcell is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Grenadier Associates Ltd., a private equity firm. Mr. Purcell has held this position since April 1989. Prior to that, Mr. Purcell served as Chief Executive Officer of SFN Cos. Inc., as Executive Vice President of CBS, Inc., as Senior Vice President Operations and Chief Financial Officer of Gannett Co., Inc. and as Chairman of Donnelley Marketing, Inc., a database direct marketing firm.

KEY SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS: 
Mr. Purcell has many years of senior management experience working in the legal, tax, publishing, broadcasting and marketing industries in roles as varied as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer which gives him a solid grasp of how to effectively oversee the management of a complex advertising, marketing and corporate communications company and, coupled with his distinguished career in private equity and finance, how to deploy a global corporation's assets and optimize its capital structure. In addition, Mr. Purcell's years of experience as a tax lawyer at Covington & Burling and as chief internal tax counsel at United Technologies have endowed him with a keen insight into legal issues and corporate compliance matters. The strength of judgment derived from this honed insight is a crucial aspect of what qualifies him to serve as the Chairman of Omnicom's Governance Committee. Further, his extensive experience as a tax lawyer also provides him with a true understanding of the important taxation issues inherent in Omnicom's global business operations. As a member of Omnicom's Board of Directors since its creation in 1986, Mr. Purcell has a deep understanding of Omnicom's history, strategies, operations, businesses and clients. This accumulated knowledge is an asset to the Board and is extremely valuable to Omnicom in the development of its complex global businesses. Mr. Purcell's contribution to Omnicom's Board is further enhanced by his extremely significant board experience at approximately 15 other public companies.

KEY SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS: 
Mr. Purcell has many years of senior management experience working in the legal, tax, publishing, broadcasting and marketing industries in roles as varied as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer which gives him a solid grasp of how to effectively oversee the management of a complex advertising, marketing and corporate communications company and, coupled with his distinguished career in private equity and finance, how to deploy a global corporation's assets and optimize its capital structure. In addition, Mr. Purcell's years of experience as a tax lawyer at Covington & Burling and as chief internal tax counsel at United Technologies have endowed him with a keen insight into legal issues and corporate compliance matters. The strength of judgment derived from this honed insight is a crucial aspect of what qualifies him to serve as the Chairman of Omnicom's Governance Committee. Further, his extensive experience as a tax lawyer also provides him with a true understanding of the important taxation issues inherent in Omnicom's global business operations. As a member of Omnicom's Board of Directors since its creation in 1986, Mr. Purcell has a deep understanding of Omnicom's history, strategies, operations, businesses and clients. This accumulated knowledge is an asset to the Board and is extremely valuable to Omnicom in the development of its complex global businesses. Mr. Purcell's contribution to Omnicom's Board is further enhanced by his extremely significant board experience at approximately 15 other public companies.
