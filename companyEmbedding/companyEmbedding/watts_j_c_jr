Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]

1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]




President Bush bows his head as Watts leads a prayer before the swearing-in ceremony for Rod Paige (right) as Secretary of Education on January 24, 2001.


In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]




President Bush bows his head as Watts leads a prayer before the swearing-in ceremony for Rod Paige (right) as Secretary of Education on January 24, 2001.


In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]




President Bush bows his head as Watts leads a prayer before the swearing-in ceremony for Rod Paige (right) as Secretary of Education on January 24, 2001.


In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]




President Bush bows his head as Watts leads a prayer before the swearing-in ceremony for Rod Paige (right) as Secretary of Education on January 24, 2001.


In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]




President Bush bows his head as Watts leads a prayer before the swearing-in ceremony for Rod Paige (right) as Secretary of Education on January 24, 2001.


In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Read an Excerpt


What Color Is a Conservative?           My Life and My PoliticsChapter One Family Is the Rock on Which We Build Our Lives Know whence you came. If you know whence you came, there is really no limit to where you can go. James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time, 1962 Donna Brazile, Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign manager, and I ought to be friends, but we're not. We're about the same age. We're both proud African Americans who are involved in public service and fascinated by the political arena. Both of us can lay claim to a few "firsts" -- she is the first black woman presidential campaign manager, and I am the first black to serve in the House Republican leadership. Our upbringings are also surprisingly similar. Our fathers both did odd jobs, and we were both raised on the poor side of the tracks. Growing up, love was a lot easier to come by than money. We both felt the sting of racism and exclusion, and I suspect that she too was called "nigger" a few times, as I was. Despite a less than easy road, however, each of us managed to graduate from college and go on to make our mark in politics and government. Yet with all that we share, Donna Brazile decided to use me to play the race card in the 2000 presidential campaign. Attacking my integrity, my motives, and my commitment to African American children, she told a reporter, "The Republicans bring out Colin Powell and J.C. Watts because they have no program, no policy. They play that game because they have no other game. They have no love and no joy. They'd rather take pictures with black children than feed them." I may have given up boxing years ago, but telling a youth minister he doesn't care about his kids is fightin' words. No one likes to be on the receiving end of a partisan barrage, but if I was going to get shot at, I was glad Colin Powell was in the foxhole with me. I've never met Donna Brazile. She certainly doesn't know me or what motivates me. Maybe our paths will cross one day, and I'll get to ask her why she chose to single out General Powell and me for what I've come to affectionately call the "full Donna." But knowing her penchant for headline-making remarks (it was an off-hand comment that got her fired as Michael Dukakis's political director in 1988), I found her intemperate comments hardly a surprise. Ms. Brazile is typical of many black leaders and political operatives today who simply can't accept the notion that there are independent-minded African American men and women who disagree with them, who have rejected their liberal philosophy and approach to problem solving. For them, group identity is more important than individual principles because for them, maintaining the group identity assures the continuation of their power. Like any group that has endured much, African Americans have created a strong and mutually reinforcing sense of group identity. That's not a bad thing in and of itself. Once the exhilaration of emancipation had worn off after the Civil War and the reality of being free but black in America had sunk in, that group identity comforted, protected, and encouraged us as a people to move forward in spite of the barriers put before our progress. That group identity gave us new strength and courage during the civil rights movement of the 1960s that ended the reign of Jim Crow and began a new era of black educational and economic upward mobility. Sometimes, though, this group identity can limit us more than it protects us. Just as the Irish, the Italians, and the Jews still take pride in their roots, African Americans today should be proud of their heritage and never forget the difficult path our people have been forced to walk. But when the group identity becomes more important than the individual, it can blind us to valuable viewpoints, options, and opportunities. I embrace my blackness, just as I do my conservatism and my Christianity, but I don't want to be defined or pigeonholed by any one of the many elements that make up my character. That refusal to be stereotyped and cast into certain beliefs and behaviors is what gets people of color who take another path, particularly a conservative path, into a heap of trouble. It doesn't matter whether it is Colin Powell or Condoleezza Rice, Shelby Steele, Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas, or yours truly -- we have all been labeled expedients, Uncle Toms, oreos, sell-outs, traitors to our race, and other equally uncomplimentary characterizations. Most of all, however, critics of black conservatives say we've forgotten where we came from. I may forget a federal budget number or, God forbid, to set the alarm clock for my weekly 6 a.m. flight to Washington, but I know exactly where I came from. I know because every decision I make every day is based on the values and lessons I learned growing up on the poor side of the tracks in a dusty little Oklahoma town that most people have never heard of and nobody can spell right the first time. I like to call the ethos I grew up with "Oklahoma values." But you'd be just as accurate if you said "American values." Except for our lack of a seacoast, Oklahoma has a little bit of just about everything that's American. We call the southeastern corner "Little Dixie" because it touches Arkansas and almost reaches Louisiana. The northern part of the state has a shared border with Missouri and Kansas. The northwestern section is a gateway to Colorado and New Mexico. And, of course, our entire southern boundary defines the northern edge of Texas. We're southern, and we're western, and Great Plains, too. Every weekend when I fly home from Washington, I never get tired of seeing the beauty and bounty of my home state.

Biography



A college football hero, charismatic  conservative, and gifted public speaker, J. C. Watts had star power when he  took the oath of office as a Member of the first Republican majority in 40  years. One of two black Republicans in Congress in his freshman term, Watts  cited his humble roots in a segregated Oklahoma  farm town as the source of his belief in self–reliance and disdain of social  welfare. “I wasn’t raised to be a Republican or Democrat,” Watts  recalled. “My parents just taught by example. They taught me and my brothers  and sisters that if you lived under their roof, you were going to work.”1 Watts  quickly became one of the GOP’s most visible spokesmen, quickly rising to the  position of Republican Conference Chair—the fourth–highest–ranking Republican  in the House. His uneasy relationship with party leaders and a desire to spend  more time with his family cut short Watts’s  Capitol Hill career in its prime.Julius  Caesar (J. C.) Watts, Jr., was born in the farming community of Eufaula, Oklahoma,  on November 18, 1957. His mother, Helen Watts, a homemaker, raised six  children: Melvin, Lawrence, Mildred, Gwen, J. C., and Darlene. Watts’s father,  Julius Caesar (Buddy) Watts, was a police  officer, a businessman, and a minister. The elder Watts  also served on the Eufaula city council, and along with his brother, Wade, was  active in the Democratic Party and the National Association for the Advancement  of Colored People (NAACP). Wade Watts headed the Oklahoma branch of the NAACP for 16 years.2 J. C. Watts was one of the first black  children to attend a previously all–white elementary school in Eufaula. At Eufaula High School,  Watts was the first African–American quarterback for the school’s football  team; some of Watts’s teammates from the  mostly segregated local community protested at first.3 While in high school, Watts  fathered two daughters with two different women. One child, Tia, was adopted by  Watt’s Uncle Wade.4 Watts  married his other daughter’s mother, Frankie Jones, whom he first met at his  seventh birthday party. The couple raised five children: LaKesha, Jerrell,  Jennifer, Julia, and Trey.5After graduating in 1976, Watts played football and  studied journalism at the University  of Oklahoma in Norman. At first, he was a seventh–string  quarterback. Discouraged with his minimal playing time, he left school multiple  times. In each instance, his father persuaded him to return.6 In 1979, Watts  became the starting quarterback and led the Sooners to Orange Bowl victories in  1980 and 1981. He was named the bowl’s most valuable player both years, and he  was inducted into the Orange Bowl Hall of Fame in 1992. Watts’s  athletic prowess provided him with motivational speaking opportunities while he  was in college.7Following  Watts’s graduation in 1981, the New York Jets,  a National Football League (NFL) team, offered him a place on their roster, but  it was not in his favorite position as quarterback. Watts  turned down the NFL offer and played from 1981 to 1986 in the Canadian Football  League (CFL).8 Watts then returned to Oklahoma to become a youth minister at Sunnyvale Baptist  Church, in Del City, Oklahoma.  Ordained in 1993, he supplemented his ministerial income by opening his own  highway construction company. His discontent with government regulation of his  business led him to contemplate running for office.Despite  the Watts family’s long–standing public support for the Democratic Party—Buddy  Watts once quipped that “a black man voting for the Republicans makes about as  much sense as a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders”—J. C. Watts subscribed to  the Republican message of social and fiscal conservatism.9 He first considered changing his party  allegiance when he covered a 1980 Oklahoma  senate campaign as a journalism student and found that his views were more in  line with those of the Republican candidate, Don Nickles.10 He officially changed his party affiliation  in 1989. “I switched my registration not out of convenience but out of  conviction,” Watts later recalled. “I knew  what I was doing would not be popular. It created some strain, even in  relationships I had built over the years. But I knew in my heart that this was  the right road, the honest road for me to take and remain true to my own  principles.”11 In 1990, Watts ran for a  seat on the Oklahoma  corporation commission, an organization that regulated the state’s telephone,  oil, and gas industries. With Oklahoma party  loyalty tending to split along racial lines, officials in the state Republican  Party eagerly embraced Watts.12 He won a seat on the commission, serving as  chairman from 1993 until his departure in 1995.13In  1994, seven–term Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma  announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate and local Republican  businessmen urged Watts to run for McCurdy’s  seat. McCurdy represented a conservative southwest Oklahoma district, with several oil reserves  and three major military installations. Agriculture was also a major industry  and the district included the University  of Oklahoma in Norman.14  Watts entered the primary as a “textbook  conservative”: He favored the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget  amendment and welfare reform. He also opposed abortion and cuts in defense  spending.15Watts faced a tough August primary challenge against state  representative Ed Apple, winning 49 percent to Apple’s 48 percent; however,  state law required a runoff primary if no candidate won more than 50 percent of  the vote.16 In preparation for the  September contest, Watts brought in  high–powered Republicans to campaign for him, including New York Representative  Jack Kemp, a football star, and National Rifle Association spokesman and actor  Charlton Heston. Watts also secured the  endorsement of the House Republican leadership. Apple lambasted Watts’s courting of out–of–state luminaries. Comparing  his local campaign to Watts’s star–power  support, he declared, “It’s grassroots vs. glitz.”17 The runoff remained close, but Watts prevailed with 52 percent of the vote.Watts continued to host high–profile Republicans for his general  election campaign, including former President George H. W. Bush, Kansas Senator  Bob Dole, and future Republican Speaker (then Republican Whip) Newt Gingrich of  Georgia.18 He and his Democratic  opponent, local attorney David Perryman, a self–described conservative, soon  found themselves in a close, heated campaign. In an attempt to appeal to the  district’s conservative farming voters, Perryman launched an advertisement  depicting Watts with his Afro hairstyle in  high school juxtaposed against images of himself as a teenager posing with his  prize–winning pigs.19 The  advertisement’s racial overtones attracted national attention and Perryman  offered to change the photograph of Watts in  the advertisement.20 Watts’s  firm conservative platform and his popularity among Oklahoma Sooners fans  prevailed. He defeated Perryman and Independent candidate Bill Tiffee, with 52  percent of the vote.21Watts’s victory established several milestones. He was the first  black Representative elected from Oklahoma  and the first Republican to win the district in 72 years.22 He was sworn in to the 104th Congress  (1995–1997) as part of the GOP national tide, putting the party in power in the  House for the first time in 40 years. Watts  increased his victories in his next three re–election campaigns, winning by as  much as 65 percent in 2000.23 He  received assignments on the Banking and Financial Services Committee and  National Security Committee (later renamed Armed Services). The latter panel  was crucial to the oversight of the three military installations in his  district. Watts left the Banking and Financial  Services Committee for a spot on the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee in the 105th Congress (1997–1999). In the 106th Congress (1999–2001),  he turned down a position on the prestigious Appropriations Committee when a  seat opened midterm; he did not want to leave the Transportation Committee. The  GOP hoped that Watts, as one of two black Republicans in the House  (Representative Gary Franks was also re–elected to a Connecticut district), would court  African–American voters, who overwhelmingly voted Democratic in national  elections. Watts focused on promoting the GOP  through black organizations. He often attended NAACP meetings and met with  representatives from historically black colleges.24 “Most black people don’t think alike. Most  black people just vote alike,” he argued. “Why is it that so many people in the  black community [who] would agree with Republican issues, why don’t they vote  Republican? I think that’s the question we have to ask.”25 However, Watts  stressed that he represented his district, rather than strictly his race. “My  father raised me to be a man, not a black man,” Watts  declared.26 “I am black, but that’s not  all of who I am,” he later added.27  Accordingly, Watts declined an invitation to  join the traditionally liberal Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). “I think the  CBC and I want the same things for the black community,” he mused. “The  difference is how we get there.”28Representative  Watts supported a fiscally conservative agenda, voting 95 percent of the time  for legislative initiatives from the Contract With America, a 1994 Republican  campaign promise to limit government spending and corruption.29 Watts’s  legislative emphasis was based on his belief that public assistance programs  encouraged dependency in poor minorities.30  In 1995, Watts teamed with Representative Jim Talent of Missouri to create the Renewal Community  Project, legislation that provided tax breaks and the deregulation of small  businesses, school vouchers allowing parents to choose their children’s  schools, and funding for faith–based organizations assisting low–income  communities. In 2000 Watts reintroduced the legislation as the American  Community Renewal Act, adding tax cuts for low–income communities as well as  opportunities for home ownership. The new legislation also eliminated the  capital gains tax and provided a “wage credit” for businesses that hired  qualified low–income employees. Watts’s goal  was to help low–income families save money. “Under the current tax system, we  penalize savings and investment and productivity,” he argued. “Those are three  things we should be rewarding.”31 The  legislation gained bipartisan support. President William J. (Bill) Clinton’s administration  supported the measure and Speaker Dennis Hastert dubbed the bill among the  GOP’s top three priorities for the second session of the 106th Congress  (1999–2001).32 The legislation was  signed into law in December 2000.Though  Watts embraced his role as a conservative, he  attempted to remain outside the debate on affirmative action.33 “Affirmative action isn’t the problem,” Watts argued. “Lousy education for black kids is the  problem. Until you fix these schools don’t talk to me about equal opportunity.”34 Watts’s personal experience with continued  racism led him to believe the United States  was not ready to abolish preferences for minorities, and Watts opposed a bill  submitted by fellow black Republican Gary Franks of Connecticut and Florida Republican Charles  Canady in the 104th Congress to eliminate affirmative action practices in the  federal government. As the bill gained momentum in the Republican House, Watts appealed directly to Speaker Newt Gingrich to block  it. “Look, in principle I don’t agree with affirmative action,” he told  Gingrich, “but in practice, we still don’t have a level playing field.” An  emotional Watts admitted to the Speaker that  he was “thinking with my heart here, not my head.” Sympathetic to Watts’s position, the Speaker arranged for the bill to  die in the Judiciary Committee.35Representative  Watts’s ability to draw national attention earned him a reputation as the GOP’s  “Great Black Hope.”36 In 1996, the  Republican Party tapped him to deliver the GOP response to President Clinton’s  State of the Union Address.37 He was the  youngest Representative and the first African American to be accorded this  honor.38 Watts’s  response was generally well received. He spoke about reducing the role of  government in American lives. “Government can’t ease all pain. In fact,  Government sometimes rubs the wound raw and makes healing harder,” he argued.  “I’m afraid that when the [Clinton]  Administration and others talk about race it sounds to me like the same old,  same old—a bunch of sermons and sloganizing that defends the old assumption  that Government can heal the racial divide.” Watts  concluded that the GOP’s “mission is to return power to your home, to where  mothers and fathers can exercise it according to their beliefs.”39 Watts was  rumored as a possible vice presidential candidate in 1996, serving as  co–chairman for GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole.40 Former Representative Kemp eventually  received the vice presidential nomination.In  1998, Watts capitalized on a GOP Conference roiled by a poor showing in the  midterm elections to challenge incumbent Conference Chairman John Boehner of Ohio. Though Republicans  had maintained their majority, exit polls showed high African–American voter  turnout in the South, the GOP’s stronghold, and only 11 percent of these Black  Americans voted Republican—down from 18 percent in 1996.41 Though he claimed he was not running as a  black candidate, Watts emphasized the GOP’s  need for broader appeal to minorities. In a letter to House Republicans, he  wrote, “It is time to let the American people know that the Republican Party is  the party of all Americans. We are the party of inclusiveness. Our ideas are  good for everyone.”42 Supporters  emphasized Watts’s strong oratorical skills,  noting that the GOP lacked a charismatic spokesperson. On Watts’s  41st birthday, November 18, 1998, he prevailed against Boehner, 121 to 93, in  the race for chairman of the House Republican Conference, the GOP’s fourth  highest position in the House.43 Watts was the first African American to join the  Republican leadership and was subsequently re–elected to the position for the  107th Congress (2001–2003).However,  Watts’s tenure in the leadership proved  difficult. Despite his elevated post, Watts  often felt alienated by GOP decision makers.44  He also found himself at odds with powerful Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas. Watts  disagreed with DeLay’s often forceful leadership. As a result, the GOP Whip’s  hands–on approach to gathering votes and maintaining party unity often  overstepped Watts’s role as the hub for  communication within the GOP Conference. In July 1999, Watts  threatened to resign from his leadership position to protest DeLay’s alleged  encroachment on his duties, but he stopped short of doing so. When Majority  Leader Dick Armey of Texas announced his  retirement in 2002, Watts considered running to replace him and he quietly  solicited the aid of congressional allies; however, DeLay nailed down enough  votes to secure the position before Watts made  an open bid for Majority Leader.45Watts also felt ignored by Republican President George W. Bush’s  administration. In 2002, the Pentagon considered eliminating funding for an $11  billion weapons system that would be partially assembled in Watts’s district in  Elgin, Oklahoma.  Watts later claimed that President Bush  refused to return his phone calls after targeting the project for spending  cuts. When Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the program’s demise  on May 8, Watts was only given two hours’  notice from the Pentagon. An early and avid supporter of the Bush  administration, Watts was furious. When the  President addressed the Republican Conference on Capitol Hill the next week, Watts was conspicuously absent.46In  2002, Watts declined to run for re–election to the 108th Congress (2003–2005),  citing a desire to spend more time with his family, who had remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington. “This business is hard on  families,” he admitted. “I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. There  are other things I want to do and can do. You have to be careful about getting  on this treadmill.”47 Prominent  Representatives of both parties implored him to stay, recognizing that his  unique position brought diversity to the House. “I hate to see him go,” noted  CBC Member James Clyburn of South    Carolina, a prominent Democrat. “J. C. is someone who  really has been quietly and forcefully doing a lot of good.”48 Civil rights leader Rosa Parks, who, in  1955, famously refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery,  Alabama, bus, wrote to Watts.  “If you can,” Parks implored him, “please remain as a pioneer on the  Republicans’ side until others come to assist you. I am glad that I stayed in  my seat.”49 Though appreciative of the  support, Watts noted that “the strength in  this business is not hanging on. The real strength is to let go.”50 Watts’s  political ally, Republican Tom Cole, won his congressional seat in the 2002  election. Though Watts left Congress, he did  not abandon the political spotlight. He formed a consulting business and  currently serves as a nationally recognized political analyst.

Though convinced of Watts’s party loyalty,  Republican officials worried that African–American voters who came to the polls  to vote for Watts would split their tickets  and cast their ballots for other Democratic candidates. Watts  called this a “sick, pathetic theory.” See Tapper, “Fade to White.”

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]




President Bush bows his head as Watts leads a prayer before the swearing-in ceremony for Rod Paige (right) as Secretary of Education on January 24, 2001.


In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]




President Bush bows his head as Watts leads a prayer before the swearing-in ceremony for Rod Paige (right) as Secretary of Education on January 24, 2001.


In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]

In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

Julius Caesar "J. C." Watts Jr. (born November 18, 1957) is an American politician from Oklahoma who was a college football quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners and later played professionally in the Canadian Football League. Watts served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, representing Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District.
Watts was born and raised in Eufaula, Oklahoma, in a rural impoverished neighborhood. After being one of the first children to attend an integrated elementary school, he became a high school quarterback and gained a football scholarship to the University of Oklahoma. He graduated from college in 1981 with a degree in journalism and became a football player in the Canadian Football League until his retirement in 1986.
Watts became a Baptist minister and was elected in 1990 to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as the first African-American in Oklahoma to win statewide office. He successfully ran for Congress in 1994 and was re-elected to three additional terms with increasing vote margins. Watts delivered the Republican response to Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union address and was elected Chair of the House Republican Conference in 1998. He retired in 2003 and turned to lobbying and business work, also occasionally serving as a political commentator.

Early life and career[edit]
Watts was born in Eufaula in McIntosh County, Oklahoma[1] to J. C. "Buddy" Watts, Sr., and Helen Watts (d. 1992).[2] His father was a Baptist minister, cattle trader,[3] the first black police officer in Eufaula,[4] and a member of the Eufaula City Council.[5] His mother was a homemaker.[6] Watts is the fifth of six children and grew up in a poor rural African-American neighborhood.[7] He was one of two black children who integrated the Jefferson Davis Elementary School in Eufaula and the first black quarterback at Eufaula High School.[4]
While in high school, Watts fathered a daughter with a white woman, causing a scandal.[8] Their families decided against an interracial marriage because of contemporary racial attitudes and Watts' family provided for the child until she could be adopted by Watts' uncle, Wade Watts, a Baptist minister, civil rights leader and head of the Oklahoma division of the NAACP.[8]
He graduated from high school in 1976 and attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship.[1][9] In 1977, Watts married Frankie Jones, an African-American woman with whom he had fathered a second daughter during high school.[6][8]
Watts began his college football career as the second-string quarterback and left college twice, but his father convinced him to return, and Watts became starting quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners in 1979 and led them to consecutive Orange Bowl victories.[5] Watts graduated from college in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts[1] in journalism.[5] Watts sought entrance in the National Football League through the New York Jets, but instead entered the Canadian Football League and played for the Ottawa Rough Riders, whom he helped reach the 1981 Grey Cup game.[5] He stayed with the team from 1981 to 1985 and played a season for the Toronto Argonauts before retiring in 1986.[5][10]
Watts returned to Oklahoma and became a youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993.[6] He is a teetotaler.[11] Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office.[6] Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, but it did not help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race.[5][9] Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles.[6] Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him.[2][12] Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990[7] for a six-year term[2] as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma.[13] He served as a member of the Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.[1]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]




Congressional photo


1994 Congressional election[edit]
Watts ran for Congress in 1994 to succeed Dave McCurdy, who had announced his retirement from the House of Representatives to run for the Senate. He positioned himself as both a fiscal and social conservative, favoring the death penalty, school prayer, a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform, and opposing abortion, gay rights, and reduced defense spending.[6] After a hard-fought primary campaign[3] against state representative Ed Apple, Watts won 49 percent to Apple's 48 percent of the vote in August 1994, and 52 percent in the resulting run-off election in September 1994 with the support of Representative Jack Kemp and actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston.[6] Watts started his race against the Democratic nominee, David Perryman, a white lawyer from Chickasha, with a wide lead in several early polls and 92 percent name recognition in one poll.[13] Watts hosted former President George H. W. Bush, U.S. Senator Bob Dole, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich[6] and focused on welfare reform and the necessity of capital formation and capital gains, as well as a reduction in the capital gains tax as beneficial for urban blacks.[13] Some voters were expected to not vote for Watts because of race, but the editor of a local political newspaper argued Watts' established Christian conservative image and his popularity as a football player would help him win.[13] On November 8, 1994, Watts was elected with 52 percent of the vote[14] as the first African-American Republican U.S. Representative from south of the Mason–Dixon line since Reconstruction.[15] He and Gary Franks of Connecticut were the only two African-American Republicans in the House.[15] Oklahoma's Fourth District at the time was 90 percent white and had been represented by Democrats since 1922.[5]
As Congressman, Watts was assigned to the Armed Services Committee and the Financial Services Committee.[6] Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda,[15] the Contract with America,[6] and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus.[11] He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring inadequate education the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government.[6] Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges.[6] In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.[9]
Reelection and successive terms[edit]
Watts' 1996 reelection campaign featured state representative Ed Crocker as the Democratic candidate[16] in a negative campaign.[2] Crocker questioned Watts' business dealings because of tax issues for a real estate company of which Watts was the principal owner, and whether he was paying child support for one of his daughters born out of wedlock.[16] Crocker suggested Watts might use drugs or sanction their use because he declined to participate in a voluntary drug screening in the House of Representatives.[17] Watts denied the charge, took the test, and accused Cocker of draft dodging during the Vietnam War and later living at the "center of the West Coast drug culture."[17] Watts was given a featured speaking role at the 1996 Republican National Convention[17] and was re-elected with 58 percent of the vote in the 1996 U.S. House election.[14]
Following the election, Watts switched from the Financial Services Committee to the House Transportation Committee.[6] He was the only African-American Republican in the House and was chosen to deliver the Republican reply to President Bill Clinton's State of the Union address in February 1997,[4] the youngest congressman and first African-American to do so.[5] In his response, Watts focused on providing a positive vision of the Republican Party and advocated deficit and tax reduction and faith-based values.[4] Watts had previously spoken to The Washington Times and created controversy by criticizing "race-hustling poverty pimps"[4] as keeping African-Americans dependent on government. These remarks were viewed as critical of activist Jesse Jackson and Washington, D.C. mayor Marion Barry, and Jesse Jackson, Jr. demanded a public apology.[4] Watts stated he did not speak about Barry and Jackson but about "some of the leadership in the black community."[4]
In his 1998 reelection campaign against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions in a federal bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.[7] Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma.[7] Watts argued he had been exonerated from any criminal conduct and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.[7] He was re-elected with 62 percent of the vote.[14]
From 1995 until 1997, Watts was only one of two black Republicans in Congress (along with Gary Franks of Connecticut). From 1997 until 2003, Watts was the only black Republican Congressman. There would not be another until the elections of Tim Scott and Allen West in 2011.
Leadership position and retirement[edit]
In Congress, Watts had established himself as a "devoted conservative."[18] He had a lifetime 94 percent rating from the American Conservative Union[19] and a lifetime "liberal quotient" of 1 percent from Americans for Democratic Action,[20] and was regarded as a team player by Republicans.[11] Watts was elected House Republican Conference Chair in 1998, replacing John Boehner,[21] after a vote of 121–93.[6] Watts assumed the position in 1999[1] and was the first African-American Republican elected to a leadership post.[11]

In his leadership position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt to restore the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products.[22] He voted to impeach Bill Clinton,[2] was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues,[3] and became a member of a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush.[23] Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work.[3] Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities,[18] and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.[24]
To keep a majority of House seats in the 2000 election, Watts advised Republicans to moderate their language and criticized the party for creating the perception it favored a view of "family values that excluded single mothers."[3] Watts opposed the Confederate battle flag flying over the South Carolina State House and advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing racial quotas.[3] By then, Watts had become involved in a contest with other members of the Republican House leadership, including Tom DeLay, over control of the party's message and nearly announced retirement in early February 2000, due to strains on his family, who remained in Oklahoma during his tenure in Washington,[6] but changed his mind after consultations with constituents, Hastert, and his family.[3] He ran, despite an earlier pledge to serve not more than three terms.[25] Watts won re-nomination with 81 percent against James Odom[26] and was re-elected by his largest margin yet against Democratic candidate Larry Weatherford.[14]
After George W. Bush took office as president, Watts co-sponsored a bill to create tax incentives for charitable donations and allow religious charities to receive federal money for social programs,[27] and proposed several new tax reductions in addition to Bush's tax cut plan,[28] targeting the estate tax and marriage penalty.[29] Watts was one of ten congressional leaders taken to an undisclosed location following the September 11 attacks.[30]
In 2002, Watts stated he would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with his family,[18] but stated the decision was difficult because Rosa Parks asked him to stay.[31] Republicans argued Watts complained about the party message and the cancellation of an artillery system in his district by the Bush Administration, which Watts denied.[18] Watts supported the candidacy of Tom Cole, who won the election to fill his seat.[32]
Post-Congressional career[edit]

After he left Congress, Watts was appointed by President Bush to be a member of the Board of Visitors to the United States Military Academy for a term expiring December 30, 2003.[33] Watts founded a lobbying and consulting firm, J. C. Watts Companies, in Washington, D.C., to represent corporations and political groups and focus on issues he championed in Congress.[34] The John Deere Company hired Watts as lobbyist in 2006 and Watts later invested in a Deere dealership and sought financial support from United States agencies and others for a farm-related project in Senegal.[35] Watts wrote an autobiography, worked as a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal[36] and joined the boards of several companies, including Dillard's,[37] Terex,[38] Clear Channel Communications,[39] and CSX Transportation,[citation needed] and served as chairman of GOPAC.[40]
Watts supported the Iraq War in 2003, stating: "America did not become the leader of the free world by looking the other way to heinous atrocities and unspeakable evils."[41] He was later hired as a political commentator by CNN[35] and following the 2006 House election, Watts argued the Republican Party had lost seats because it failed to address the needs of urban areas and did not offer a positive message. He stated: "We lost our way, pure and simple."[42]
In 2008, Watts announced he was developing a cable news network with the help of Comcast, focusing on an African-American audience,[43] and that he considered voting for Barack Obama, criticizing the Republican party for failing in outreach to the African-American community.[44] Reports showed he contributed to John McCain, but not to Obama.[45]
Watts considered running to succeed Brad Henry as Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 gubernatorial election,[46] but declined in May 2009, citing his business and contractual obligations.[47]
On April 7, 2015, Watts joined U.S. Senator Rand Paul on stage during Paul's announcement speech for U.S. President.[48] Watts endorsed Paul in his presidential bid.[49]
For most of 2016, Watts served as the President and CEO of Feed the Children. The Board of Directors announced his appointment on January 21.[50] On November 15, the organization and Mr. Watts announced that he was no longer serving in those roles.[51]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

J. C. Watts Quotes

American
-
Politician

Born: November 18, 1957

Republicans and Democrats have used accounting gimmicks and competing government analyses to deceive the public into believing that 2 + 2 = 6. If our leaders cannot agree on the numbers, if 'facts' are fictional, how can they possibly have a substantive debate on solutions?
J. C. Watts


Government,
Accounting




















It doesn't take a lot of strength to hang on. It takes a lot of strength to let go.
J. C. Watts


Strength,
Go,
Hang




























We need to remember that politics is all about people, not programs. We shouldn't want to take the humanness out of the political arena.
J. C. Watts


Politics,
Political,
People



















Affirmative action is a little like the professional football draft. The NFL awards its No. 1 draft choices to the lowest-ranked team in the league. It doesn't do this out of compassion or guilt. It's done for mutual survival. They understand that a league can only be as strong as its weakest team.
J. C. Watts


Team,
Strong,
Football



















Character is doing the right thing when nobody's looking. There are too many people who think that the only thing that's right is to get by, and the only thing that's wrong is to get caught.
J. C. Watts


Character,
Looking,
People



















The past two decades revolutionized the way we access information. You and I can have our questions answered with the click of a mouse at any time of day. If America, both corporation and citizen alike, can use these services to solve problems, why can't Washington?
J. C. Watts


Time,
Past,
Day



















The measure of a man is not how great his faith is, but how great his love is. We must not let government programs disconnect our souls from each other.
J. C. Watts


Love,
Faith,
Great



















I'm not one that believes that affirmative action should be based on one's skin color or one's gender, I think it should be done based on one's need, because I think if you are from a poor white community, I think that poor white kid needs a scholarship just as badly as a poor black kid.
J. C. Watts


Community,
Action,
Black



















I think you grow wherever God plants you. I hope I'm growing as a person of faith, as a Christian. That should be our number one objective this journey of life. That all starts with a personal intimate relationship with Christ and then being in prayer every single day about all of those things - being tenacious about it.
J. C. Watts


Life,
Relationship,
Journey
























Everyone tries to define this thing called Character. It's not hard. Character is doing what's right when nobody's looking.
J. C. Watts


Character,
Looking,
Doing



















Good policy makes good politics and what I've done has been good politics.
J. C. Watts


Good,
Politics,
Done



















I would caution all of us or I would remind all of us that any candidate that we support, they are going to be flawed.
J. C. Watts


Support,
Going,
Caution



















When you look at the results that Newt Gingrich got when he was speaker, he got results for the American people.
J. C. Watts


American,
Look,
People



















There's a whole lot more to the African-American community than entertainment and sports.
J. C. Watts


Sports,
Community,
More



















Having a Republican candidate speak at the NAACP convention is like trying to build a house starting at the roof. If you don't have a foundation, the roof isn't going to stand.
J. C. Watts


Trying,
Foundation,
Speak
























Republicans think that the NAACP is the only voice in the black community. It is a voice in the black community. But it's not the only voice.
J. C. Watts


Community,
Black,
Voice



















When it comes to the American dream, no one has a corner on the market. All of us have an equal chance to share in that dream.
J. C. Watts


Chance,
American,
Dream



















In addition, there is one title I cherish a great deal more than Congressman and that is the title of... Dad.
J. C. Watts


Dad,
Great,
More



















I embrace my blackness, just as I do my conservatism and my Christianity, but I don't want to be defined or pigeonholed by any one of the many elements that make up my character.
J. C. Watts


Character,
Want,
Embrace



















I'm looking forward to the day when America will mature to the point that we are a color-blind society. I'm not so sure that in politics that will ever be reality, because politics has a way of separating us based on skin color.
J. C. Watts


Politics,
Day,
Society



















Reparations, I believe, are talked about for political reasons, trying to cater for the purpose of getting votes. If Congress was serious about reparations - in '93 and '94 the Democrats controlled the House, the Senate and the White House, and not one single Republican vote was needed for reparations.
J. C. Watts


Purpose,
Believe,
Trying



















I'm secure in who I am. I don't need the validation of those that would say, you have to be a certain thing in order to be accepted. I'm comfortable going against the grain if I need to.
J. C. Watts


I Am,
You,
Comfortable
























In my wildest imagination, I never thought that the fifth of six children born to Helen and Buddy Watts - in a poor black neighborhood, in the poor rural community of Eufaula, Oklahoma - would someday be called Congressman.
J. C. Watts


Children,
Community,
Black



















If you are explaining, you are losing.
J. C. Watts


Losing,
You,
Explaining



















The Democratic Party has taken the black community for granted and said, 'This is the most loyal constituency we have. They're not going anywhere.' But the Republican Party has said, 'That's the most loyal constituency Democrats have. They're not going anywhere. We've got to win without them.'
J. C. Watts


Community,
Black,
Party



















Individual responsibility, hard work, paying attention in school, faith, family all these things are important.
J. C. Watts


Work,
Family,
Hard Work
