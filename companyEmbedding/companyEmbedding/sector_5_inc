Notes: 


1. Manufacturing of our products. 

2. Product Development; design and pattern. 

3. Contractor/Fees; allocated for the purpose of paying potential part-time 
employees or contracted employees.  None of the proceeds allocated in this 
category are intended to pay the CEO, or directors of the Company. 

4. The category of General Working Capital may include, but is not limited to, 
postage, telephone services, overnight delivery services and other general 
operating expenses.

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the proceeds 
of this offering based on planned use of funds for the our operations and 
current objectives. Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be 
held in reserve as working capital and subject to reallocation to other line 
item expenditures as required for ongoing operations.

We currently consider the foregoing project our priority and intend to use the 
proceeds from this offering for such projects.


Sector 5, Inc. has many potential competitors in the garment and specifically 
the denim marketplace.  We acknowledge that our competition is competent, 
experienced, and they have greater financial, development, and marketing 
resources than we do at the present. Our ability to compete may be adversely 
affected by the ability of these competitors to devote greater resources to 
the development, sales, and marketing of their products than are available to 
us. 

Some of Sector 5’s competitors may also offer a wider range of apparel and 
have greater name recognition.  They have greater customer loyalty bases and 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing 
opportunities, fashions, and customer design desires. In addition our 
competitors may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, 
offer terms that are more attractive to wholesales and customers and adopt 
more aggressive pricing policies than Sector 5 at the present.


Company Description
Sector 5, Inc. was formed in the state of Nevada on April 11, 2012. We are a 
development stage company with a principal business of design and 
manufacturing of women’s fashion design denim apparels.  Sector 5 plans to 
market its own brand under the brand name “Urban Street Apparel”. Because of


 
the brand name Urban Street Apparel we plan to take advantage of the “USA” 
acronym, which is famous, the world over for quality and design, in its 
marketing campaign.  Sector 5’s intentions are to stay on the cutting edge of 
the swiftly changing young woman’s apparel market. As the marketplace for high 
end fashion denim has increased dramatically over the last 7-10 years, Sector 
5 plans to position itself deep in the fashion culture by introducing new 
styles and designs on an ongoing basis.  As Urban Street Apparel will be a new 
brand coming into the marketplace, we also plan on reselling current existing 
popular brands as a draw to attract potential new customers while showcasing 
our own brand.  That combined, with our innovative “fifth pocket” design and 
marketing, Urban Street Apparel plans to carve a distinctive niche in this 
lucrative, high margin, garment sector. 

Current management is comprised of Jeannie C. Bacal, CEO and President. Due to 
the development stage of the Company, Ms. Bacal distributes part of her time 
toward the everyday operations and forward movement of the corporation. Ms. 
Bacal’s responsibilities include acting as the company’s creative designer as 
well as determining the overall design direction of the company and its 
marketing strategy.  Ms. Bacal has cultivated relationships with design 
consultants and manufacturing representatives. Ms. Bacal and her relationships 
with targeted consultants should help her in her efforts to further the 
development of operations during the development stage of the Company.

Sector 5 is a development stage company that has not commenced its planned 
principal operations to date.  Sector 5 plans to launch its full operations 
including apparel under its own brand approximately six to nine months 
following the closing of the offering. Operations to date have been devoted 
primarily to start-up and development activities, which include the following:

1. Development stage; denim jean design and manufacturing components 
(denim vendors, cut and sew, washers, and finishers);

2. Initiated initial website design, layout and development; 

3. Due diligence continuing on potential market outlets; 

4. Initiated contacts with contractors to help with development; 

5. Patterns and design for Urban Street Apparel brand continuing; 

6. Initial stage of evaluating and identifying daily deal coupons for “Fifth 
Pocket” marketing campaign (local, regional and national); 

7. Bulk denim; identified, sourced, quality evaluation. 

Sector 5 has identified the following challenges to its success: 

1. Finalize design of our Urban Street Apparel fashion garments; The Company 
is continuing to perform the necessary due diligence and undertaking the 
necessary steps and procedures so our signature brand launch we hope will be 
widely accepted by our targeted market.

2. Effective Marketing Campaign: In order to effectively enter our targeted 
market, Sector 5 plans to use a multi-faceted marketing plan that includes a 
high-end web site, targeted print media, and eventually target specific 
distribution channels using independent representatives. Initially we must get 
customers to our website so we are focusing particular attention to address 
this issue.  As the Company gains more recognition in the marketplace we plan 
to have Independent commissioned sales representatives work as middlemen 
between Sector 5 and retailers. Their responsibilities include approaching 
large retailers, work trade shows and employ creative marketing techniques to 
attract boutique type retailers and shops.

3. Constantly monitor and appealing to our target market: We plan to constantly
monitor our target market and place a personal emphasis on quality. Our 
overall business structure we plan to be geographically accessible (localized 
design and manufacturing capabilities) in an ultimate goal to be able to 
respond quickly to the markets potentially changing desires and demands.

The Company believes that raising $50,000 through the sale of common equity is 
sufficient for the company to become operational and sustain operations 
through the next twelve (12) months. The capital we are raising has been 
budgeted to launch our product line of women’s garments and to become a fully 
reporting company.  Unfortunately, there can be no assurance that the actual 
expenses incurred will not materially exceed our estimates or that cash flow 
from services will be adequate to maintain our business. As a result, our 
independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to 
continue as a going concern in the independent auditors’ report to the 
financial statements included in the registration statement.

Sector 5 currently has one officer and director. This individual allocates 
time and personal resources to Sector 5 on a part-time basis and devotes 
approximately 15 hours a week to the Company. Once the public offering is 
closed, Ms. Bacal plans to spend the time necessary to oversee the product 
development, manufacturing, sales and marketing campaigns, website design, and 
direct the primary operations of the business. 

Sector 5 has administrative offices located at 2186 Darby Street, Escondido, 
California 92025. Telephone number: (702) 406-6848.

They’re easy for everyone to use: Whether it’s helping with homework or resolving dinner-table disputes, Chromebooks can help answer everyone’s questions. And with automatic security updates, Chromebooks help keep your family safe from computer viruses and malware.



    Sector 5® education & business technology connects people, making
all forms of communication—including
business transactions, video sharing, and
mobile browsing—faster and less expensive.
The work often involves designing, testing,
maintaining, and improving computer software,
hardware, systems, and networks. “The
goal is not only to solve a problem, but also
to make that problem easier to solve in the future,” says Dan Parsons, an IT manager in
Portland, Oregon.

“The future of the economy is in STEM,” says James Brown, the executive director of the STEM Education Coalition in Washington, D.C.

“That’s where the jobs of tomorrow will be.” Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) support that assertion.

Employment in occupations related to STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—is projected to grow to more than 9 million between 2012 and 2022. That’s an increase of about 1 million jobs over 2012 employment levels. Get Involved

    Minimalist Design
Sector 5® has defined application of minimalist philosophies and principles in hardware and software design together with Google as a Partner. This affordable and well designed, user-friendly educational electronic device is made with love and designed by artists and engineers at Sector 5® Inc.


Every child in America deserves an education that opens opportunities—especially the opportunity to join a thriving middle class. Yet, too many children—particularly those in poverty—lack access to the education and supports that make the journey to the middle class possible. Sector 5® supported by the Trump Administration is committed to ensuring that every child has that opportunity. The high school graduation rate is at its highest point in history, in large part due to increases in the number of African-American and Hispanic students receiving diplomas. Dropout rates are down steeply for African-American, Hispanic, and low-income young people, and college attendance by minorities has jumped sharply. 






 



    Drop & spill resistant

Sector 5® has taken special care in manufacturing a Chromebook that can handle the weather and everyday incidents that would normally destroy our same price category competitors.  A long lasting and durable computer that is easily taken with you, wherever you go, Sector 5® cares with this exceptionally well designed E1 Chromebook. The affordability, durability and useability also make it a top pick for schools, universities, and charter schools dedicated to EdTech.



 Science workers study the physical and
natural world through observation and experimentation.
“Science is a lens to interpret the
world,” says Julie Herrick, a volcanologist at
the Smithsonian Institution National Museum
of Natural History in Washington, DC. “My
job is to expand knowledge.” Science workers
can also inform public policy.   






 



    For education
Starting at $149, this Sector 5® Chromebook is the easiest device to set up and manage — lowering total ownership costs with time, administration and durability.

    Share with an unlimited number of students
Even when Chromebooks are shared in classes, each student gets a completely personalized experience, including access to his or her own classwork, apps, books and videos.


    Multiple profiles, guests welcome, share away
With security built-in, students and teachers can share their Chromebook with others without fear of common computer problems like accidental software installations, malware or altered settings.


    Engineers and engineering technicians
use math, science, and technology to solve
real-world problems. “Engineering makes things better and
cheaper for everyone,” says Patrick Holm, a
project civil engineer in Olympia, Washington.
“Without it, we couldn’t live in the kind
of society we know—with bridges, clean
    water, and cars.”

    Performance Packed

Work online or offKeep getting stuff done when you’re disconnected from the web by using offline apps like Gmail and Google Docs.
There is no universally agreed-upon definition
of STEM. Experts generally do agree, however,
that STEM workers use their knowledge
of science, technology, engineering, or math
to try to understand how the world works and
to solve problems. Their work often involves
the use of computers and other tools.

    Stay synced with Android phones and tablets too


    
    For picking up where you left off

Chromebooks stay synced with your Android phones & tablets, and everywhere you're signed in with your Google account - so your stuff stays with you, even when your laptop doesn't.

    ESSA includes provisions that will help to ensure success for students and schools. Below are just a few. The law: 

Advances equity by upholding critical protections for America's disadvantaged and high-need students.
Requires—for the first time—that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in college and careers.
Ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through annual statewide assessments that measure students' progress toward those high standards.
Helps to support and grow local innovations—including evidence-based and place-based interventions developed by local leaders and educators—consistent with our Investing in Innovation and Promise Neighborhoods
Sustains and expands this administration's historic investments in increasing access to high-quality preschool.
Maintains an expectation that there will be accountability and action to effect positive change in our lowest-performing schools, where groups of students are not making progress, and where graduation rates are low over extended periods of time.

Portland, Oregon.

“The future of the economy is in STEM,” says James Brown, the executive director of the STEM Education Coalition in Washington, D.C.

“That’s where the jobs of tomorrow will be.” Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) support that assertion.

Employment in occupations related to STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—is projected to grow to more than 9 million between 2012 and 2022. That’s an increase of about 1 million jobs over 2012 employment levels. Get Involved

    Minimalist Design
Sector 5® has defined application of minimalist philosophies and principles in hardware and software design together with Google as a Partner. This affordable and well designed, user-friendly educational electronic device is made with love and designed by artists and engineers at Sector 5® Inc.


Every child in America deserves an education that opens opportunities—especially the opportunity to join a thriving middle class. Yet, too many children—particularly those in poverty—lack access to the education and supports that make the journey to the middle class possible. Sector 5® supported by the Trump Administration is committed to ensuring that every child has that opportunity. The high school graduation rate is at its highest point in history, in large part due to increases in the number of African-American and Hispanic students receiving diplomas. Dropout rates are down steeply for African-American, Hispanic, and low-income young people, and college attendance by minorities has jumped sharply. 






 



    Drop & spill resistant

Sector 5® has taken special care in manufacturing a Chromebook that can handle the weather and everyday incidents that would normally destroy our same price category competitors.  A long lasting and durable computer that is easily taken with you, wherever you go, Sector 5® cares with this exceptionally well designed E1 Chromebook. The affordability, durability and useability also make it a top pick for schools, universities, and charter schools dedicated to EdTech.



 Science workers study the physical and
natural world through observation and experimentation.
“Science is a lens to interpret the
world,” says Julie Herrick, a volcanologist at
the Smithsonian Institution National Museum
of Natural History in Washington, DC. “My
job is to expand knowledge.” Science workers
can also inform public policy.   






 



    For education
Starting at $149, this Sector 5® Chromebook is the easiest device to set up and manage — lowering total ownership costs with time, administration and durability.

    Share with an unlimited number of students
Even when Chromebooks are shared in classes, each student gets a completely personalized experience, including access to his or her own classwork, apps, books and videos.


    Multiple profiles, guests welcome, share away
With security built-in, students and teachers can share their Chromebook with others without fear of common computer problems like accidental software installations, malware or altered settings.


    Engineers and engineering technicians
use math, science, and technology to solve
real-world problems. “Engineering makes things better and
cheaper for everyone,” says Patrick Holm, a
project civil engineer in Olympia, Washington.
“Without it, we couldn’t live in the kind
of society we know—with bridges, clean
    water, and cars.”

There is no universally agreed-upon definition
of STEM. Experts generally do agree, however,
that STEM workers use their knowledge

    For picking up where you left off

Chromebooks stay synced with your Android phones & tablets, and everywhere you're signed in with your Google account - so your stuff stays with you, even when your laptop doesn't.

    ESSA includes provisions that will help to ensure success for students and schools. Below are just a few. The law: 

Advances equity by upholding critical protections for America's disadvantaged and high-need students.
Requires—for the first time—that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in college and careers.
Ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through annual statewide assessments that measure students' progress toward those high standards.
Helps to support and grow local innovations—including evidence-based and place-based interventions developed by local leaders and educators—consistent with our Investing in Innovation and Promise Neighborhoods
Sustains and expands this administration's historic investments in increasing access to high-quality preschool.
Maintains an expectation that there will be accountability and action to effect positive change in our lowest-performing schools, where groups of students are not making progress, and where graduation rates are low over extended periods of time.

ALEXANDRIA, Va., April 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Sector 5, Inc. a Nevada fully reporting public corporation (OTCQB: SECT) announces that on March 18, 2016, a change in control of Sector 5 occurred.  Sector 5, formally a Women's, Misses' and Juniors' Outerwear Company, has formally requested the SEC to change to a SIC: 3571 Electronic Computers. This change will occur approximately August 2016 when the SEC is scheduled to make changes to all Company profiles. The change in control includes a plan of new management to launch Sector 5 branded electronics focused on Chrome, Android and Windows Operating Systems products targeting the educational and consumer electronics markets. 








The change in control included the purchase of controlling interest by Kirkland Holdings Co. and its sole officer Roger B. McKeague, currently the CEO, CFO, and sole Director of Sector 5 Nevada.  Prior or to joining the Company in March 2016, Mr. McKeague was the Chief Executive Officer of Sector Five, Inc., an unaffiliated Delaware electronics company, and was an attorney and business consultant focused on business and education management from November 2015 to April 2016. 
Peter Mortenson was appointed President in April of 2016.   Mr. Mortensen was the Software R&D Director of Panasonic Avionics.  Mr. Mortensen managed a department of 52 software developers covering R&D in Android and Linux software development for inflight entertainment (IFE) systems both for passengers (seatback systems) and crew (in-wall and mobile terminals) for all major airlines.  Mr. Mortensen was Foreign Expert and Director of Product Planning for Digital Products Group, a Company specializing in mobile phones, tablets & TVs. (Full Bios) can be viewed on Sector-five.com. 
Roger McKeague, CEO, provided this insight, "Our initial phase will focus on the education markets utilizing Chrome Operating Systems, Charging Carts and Large Screen TV's. Sector 5 has a competitive advantage on price, quality and customer service."  
As our sales staff ramps up, we intend to broadly target general consumer retail channels and possibly other B2B opportunities (e.g., hospitals). In this phase we will need to carefully and continuously balance growth in width (number of sales channels and product SKU's) versus depth (quality of service and support). 
We are currently negotiating contracts with experienced sales and marketing individuals and companies who we believe can get Sector 5 branded products placed in major retail channels. We believe that our relationship with Google will assist us in entering into contracts with major distributors for U.S. markets.
About Sector 5, Inc.
Sector 5, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, publicly traded (OTCQB: SECT), that creates, manufactures and sells Sector 5 branded electronics utilizing Chrome, Android and Windows Operating Systems, focused on the educational and consumer electronics markets. Sector 5 and its manufacturing partners, "best in class" suppliers, and tier-1 designers are working together to combine American ingenuity and China's manufacturing strengths to create products with the latest technology, innovative features (rugged designs, spill/drop resistant, portable) and best pricing, exceeding market expectations. Sector 5's distribution strategy centers on our competitive advantages in the B2B, retail, e-commerce, K-12 and Higher Education markets. Sector 5's foundation of success and promise to the world is defined by a pursuit of simplicity and a commitment to innovation. Quality, reliability and excellent customer support is an integral component of that commitment. Further information can be found at www.sector-five.com.
