Important noteInterests in the Challenger Guaranteed Income Fund ARSN 139 607 122 (Fund) are offered by Challenger Retirement and Investment Services Limited ABN 80 115 534 453, AFSL 295642 (Challenger).
Earnings rates shown on this site are the currently applicable earnings rate for the open classes of units in the Fund. The earnings rate that applies to a person's investment in the Fund is the earnings rate that is current on their investment date and may be different to the earnings rate shown on this page. This is because earnings rates are updated at least weekly and change. Accordingly, it is important to check the currently applicable earnings rate on a person's investment date and update any information provided to them prior to that date as required.
The distribution, maturity date and maturity unit price information also relates to the different open classes of units in the Fund. The distribution and maturity unit price are fixed and assume that units in the Fund are held to the relevant maturity date. If an investor withdraws from the Fund before the relevant maturity date they may receive significantly less back than if they held their investment until the maturity date.
Challenger Life Company Limited (Challenger Life) is the provider of the annuities and derivative contracts in which the Fund invests. Whilst Challenger Life's Statutory Fund No 2 is contractually obliged to make certain guaranteed income and capital payments to the Fund, no company within the Challenger Group provides a guarantee in respect of the Fund or a person's return. Challenger, as the responsible entity of the Fund, does not provide any guarantee in respect of the Fund, the earnings rate or the distribution or the maturity unit price. An investment in the Fund is also not secured against loss and under the constitution there is no recourse against the responsible entity (including in its personal capacity) or for investors in one class against the assets of the Fund that are referrable to another class.
A copy of the current product disclosure statement for the Fund (PDS) can be downloaded from this site or from our website: www.challenger.com.au Reference should be made to the PDS which includes important information (including about the earnings rate and about the guarantees provided by Challenger Life to the Fund).
The information on this site is not intended to be financial product advice. It does not take into account any person's objectives, financial situation or needs and is provided solely for the use of licensed financial advisers and is not to be passed on to a retail client except where it is included by a licensed financial product adviser as part of their own advice to their client. Before making an investment decision in respect of the Fund a person should consider the appropriateness of this information having regard to their objectives, financial situation and needs. Advisers and persons considering investing in the Fund should first obtain and consider the information in the PDS before making an investment decision (including deciding whether to acquire or continue to hold any investment in the Fund). Where a person acquires or holds units in the Fund, Challenger and Challenger Life will receive the fees and/or other benefits disclosed in the PDS. Neither Challenger nor Challenger Life nor their employees receive any specific remuneration for any advice provided. Some or all of Challenger group companies and their directors may benefit from fees, commissions and other benefits received by another group company.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
