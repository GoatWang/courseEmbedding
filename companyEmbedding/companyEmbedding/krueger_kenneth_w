The Manitowoc Company Appoints Kenneth W. Krueger Interim Chairman, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer






October 28, 2015 05:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MANITOWOC, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (NYSE: MTW) announced today that it has 
      named current Board member Kenneth W. Krueger as interim chairman, 
      president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. The 
      company has also announced that Glen Tellock has resigned as Manitowoc’s 
      chairman, president and chief executive officer, and will step down from 
      the Board of Directors, to pursue other opportunities. The Board of 
      Directors has initiated a search for a chief executive officer of 
      Manitowoc Cranes. Hubertus Muehlhaeuser will remain the chief executive 
      officer of Manitowoc Foodservice.
    


      As stated in the company’s third-quarter earnings release issued this 
      afternoon, it remains on track to execute the spin of its Foodservice 
      business in the first quarter of 2016.
    

      “Manitowoc has maintained its industry-leading positions in Cranes and 
      Foodservice in spite of significant macro-economic headwinds and 
      operational issues over the last 18 months,” Roy Armes, The Manitowoc 
      Company’s lead independent director commented. “The Board of Directors, 
      however, believe this is the right time for new leadership at the 
      company. Ken’s deep knowledge of Manitowoc’s businesses, coupled with 
      his robust financial and operational expertise, make him an excellent 
      choice to lead the company’s efforts as we execute a search for our next 
      chief executive officer. In his interim role, Ken will be focused on 
      executing the company’s efforts to improve financial performance and 
      executing the spin of the Foodservice business, as well as implementing 
      the restructuring initiatives we announced today. Our commitment to 
      delivering superior quality, innovative products and unmatched customer 
      support is unwavering as we further extend our leadership in the 
      marketplace.”
    

      Armes concluded, “On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank 
      Glen for his efforts and contributions to Manitowoc over the last 24 
      years. We wish him well in his future endeavors.”
    

      In addition to being a member of the company’s Board of Directors since 
      2004, including four years as audit committee chair, Mr. Krueger has had 
      a distinguished career that blends an extensive financial and 
      operational background. Mr. Krueger most recently served as chief 
      operating officer at Bucyrus International, Inc., a global leader in 
      mining equipment manufacturing, before retiring in 2009. While at 
      Bucyrus, he helped to grow revenues by 138% and EBITDA by 247%, while 
      concurrently implementing Lean manufacturing principles, launching new 
      products and enhancing existing equipment, and streamlining product 
      development processes and priorities, among other areas of focus. Prior 
      to that he served as chief financial officer at A.O. Smith, a leading 
      water technology company, and Rockwell Automation, a global leader in 
      industrial automation, from 2000-2005 and 1983-1999, respectively.
    

About The Manitowoc Company, Inc.


      Founded in 1902, The Manitowoc Company, Inc. is a multi-industry, 
      capital goods manufacturer with 92 manufacturing, distribution, and
