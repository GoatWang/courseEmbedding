����������� This Agreement is entered into between the State of Maine Securities Division ("Securities Division") and Deltec
Asset Management LLC (" Deltec Asset Management"), a broker-dealer
located in New York, New York.
 
����������� WHEREAS, the
parties agree as follows:
 
1.                 
At all
relevant times, it has been unlawful in Maine for a person to act as a
broker-dealer unless licensed or exempt from licensing under the Revised Maine
Securities Act, Title 32 Maine Revised Statutes Annotated �10101 et seq.
 
2.                 
Deltec Asset
Management filed an application with the Securities Division for licensing as a
broker-dealer on November 6, 2000.
 
3.                 
On December 4,
 2000, the Securities
Division sent a letter to Deltec Asset Management requesting that the firm
provide additional information in connection with its pending broker-dealer
application.
 
4.                 
On December 13,
 2000, the Securities
Division received a letter from Stephen Zuppello in which he provided, among
other things, details regarding transactions effected in six (6) Maine-based
accounts. He disclosed that six (6) transactions had been effected in the
accounts.
 
5.                 
It is the
Securities Division's position that Deltec Asset Management has acted as a
broker-dealer in Maine without being licensed or exempt from licensing.
 
6.                 
Deltec Asset
Management has represented to the Securities Division that the violations
occurred when the accounts of the predecessor firm, Deltec Asset Management
Corporation, where transferred to Deltec Asset Management LLC, and the firm was
required to register as a new firm in each state.
 
7.                 
Both parties
desire an expeditious resolution of this matter.
����������� NOW
THEREFORE, without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and
without Deltec Asset Management admitting or denying that its conduct violated
the Revised Maine Securities Act, it is agreed that:���� 
 
1.�������� Deltec Asset Management will comply
with all licensing and other legal requirements governing persons acting as
securities broker-dealers in the State of Maine at all times from the date
hereof;
 
2.�������� In lieu of the Securities Division
seeking the imposition of a penalty for the allegations contained herein,
Deltec Asset Management will pay the sum of $3000 to the Securities Division
upon Deltec Asset Management's execution of this Agreement; and
 
3.�������� The Securities Division will not take
further action against Deltec Asset Management, based upon its unlicensed
status during the period preceding and including the date of execution of this
Agreement, PROVIDED, however, that this
paragraph applies only to those transactions previously disclosed to the
Securities Division by Deltec Asset Management.
