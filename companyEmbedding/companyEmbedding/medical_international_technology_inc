ArterioVision

MTI’s lead product, the CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) test, or ArterioVision,
                                                    consists of standardized B-mode ultrasound image acquisition methodology and software that enables
                                                    clinicians to safely and non-invasively screen for and monitor atherosclerosis (the underlying cause of heart attack and stroke) in individuals who are either asymptomatic or symptomatic for cardiovascular disease.


                                                    ArterioVision™ is a 
                                                    convenient, safe, painless 
                                                    and precise technique for 
                                                    measuring the thickness of 
                                                    the first two layers of the 
                                                    vascular wall, the very site 
                                                    where atherosclerosis 
                                                    develops.  Wall thickening 
                                                    is the earliest anatomical 
                                                    manifestation of 
                                                    atherosclerosis and vascular 
                                                    disease.  ArterioVision™ is 
                                                    a non-invasive "biopsy" done 
                                                    via simple skin surface 
                                                    imaging which can be used to 
                                                    determine the health of the 
                                                    arterial wall.

                                                    Additionally, MTI’s 
                                                    technology enables 
                                                    clinicians to 
                                                    monitor treatment efficacy.  
                                                    By using ArterioVision™ as 
                                                    an ongoing tool within their

For Patients 

What is a CIMT test?
The CIMT (Carotid Intima-Media Thickness) test is a
                                                        convenient, safe and
                                                        painless ultrasound
                                                        procedure that measures the thickness of the first two inner layers of the carotid artery wall.
How can it help me?
The CIMT test is a direct measurement of vascular disease  the cause of heart attack and stroke  even in its early stages, before it starts to block blood flow in the artery and cause symptoms. 
What is the carotid artery, and why is it so important?
The carotid is
                                                        a major artery located on both sides of the neck. Its function is to supply blood to the brain.
                                                        It is the largest artery near the surface of the skin and can
                                                        be examined
                                                        non-invasively without injections,
                                                        radioisotopes, contrast media, catheterization or radiation.
Why is the early detection of coronary artery disease so important?
According
                                                        to the AHA, 50% of men
                                                        and 64% of women who die
                                                        suddenly  of CVD
                                                        have no previous
                                                        symptoms.  Therefore, early detection is crucial.
Coronary artery disease may partially or completely block the blood's flow through the artery. The result:

Bleeding (hemorrhage) into the plaque
														
															Formation of a blood clot (thrombosis) on the plaque's surface
													
														
If either of these occurs and blocks the entire artery, a stroke or heart attack may result.
If cardiovascular disease is detected, what can I do to
                                                        reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke?
In addition to lowering your cholesterol and blood pressure  which  often can be accomplished through medication  many risk factors can be addressed.  
                                                        See your doctor for
                                                        recommendations.
Remember, for many people with coronary artery disease, death is the first symptom. So, be proactive!
Who should have a CIMT test?
Individuals with the following risk factors for vascular disease:

Family history of heart disease/stroke
														
															
															Overweight
														
															
															
															Physical
                                                              inactivity
															Age 40 & over
														
															High-fat diet
														
															
															Tobacco user
														
															
															
															Elevated

How often should I undergo a CIMT test?
Depending upon your condition and current course of treatment, follow-up CIMT testing should be conducted 
                                                        periodically.  Your 
                                                        doctor will advise when 
                                                        you should be tested.
Is a CIMT test painful? Am I exposed to radiation during the test?
No, absolutely not!  The 
                                                        test is painless and 
                                                        non-invasive with no 
                                                        radiation exposure.
How long will a CIMT test take?
15-20 minutes.
How do I get my results? What do I look for?
Review the report with your physician. In general, the higher the CIMT 
                                                        value, the greater the likelihood of developing symptomatic heart disease. Please keep in mind that even if your 
                                                        value indicates a high risk for a heart attack, health awareness enables you to take proactive steps to lower your modifiable risk factors for heart disease. 
How much does a CIMT 
                                                        test cost? 

                                                        CIMT testing is a new 
                                                        procedure and is 
                                                        available to you at an 
                                                        affordable price.

The Bottom Line

All of us have atherosclerosis.  Half of us will die from it.
                                                        Although no risk factor
                                                        or technique is 100% accurate in predicting who will
                                                        die from cardiovascular disease, imaging the arterial wall can bring this silent killer into the light for early prevention and intervention.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.  Business Development  Expanding the product line:  Medical International Technology Inc. ("MIT or the "Company") has been expanding financial resources in R&D in the last 5 years. MIT already has 5 products for the human market and 9 products for the animal market. The company has unveiled two new additions one for the human line and one for its animal line to our distributors.  MIT's patented technology has received approval in several countries worldwide. The Company expects that the two new products will be no exception.  The Company has decided not to put any physical nor financial effort at this time in pursuing its efforts for the FDA certification and will resume its effort in fiscal year 2017/2018.  The Company has decided to put more effort in its existing products and existing market for the next three quarters and the year 2016/2017, in order to better consolidate and serve our existing Distributor.  Projected Sales and Market Breakdown  The following information will outline market expectations by category and timeframe:  Human applications:  The Company has decided for the next three quarters and the year 2016/2017 to put more effort in expanding our cosmetic dermatology, plastic surgery, podiatry market, it will do so through the use of the Med-Jet models MIT MBX, MIT-H-III and the MESO-JET.  Animal applications:  The Company has decided for the next three quarters and the year 2016/2017 to put more effort in expanding the pork, cattle, and poultry markets, using our existing products for mass animal vaccination.  China Joint Venture  The creation of MIT China in June of 2009 has given MIT a unique advantage to expand its production operations and increase its sales and profits in the multi-billion dollar worldwide needle-free injector market. Furthermore, MIT China venture will help MIT supply large production volumes in lesser time, which will attract large medical and pharmaceutical partners.  The introduction of our Agro-Jet needle-free injector for animal application is progressing well; our veterinary staff has been successfully job training our distributors in various regions. We expect that these efforts will result in sales growth for the coming fiscal quarters and years.  During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, MIT China purchased 151,000 sq. ft. of land and began construction of their first building in Taizhou (China Medical City). This first building of 40,000 sq. ft. when finalized will be used for the production of injectors for the Chinese market only.  The work in progress at MIT China for the construction of its 40,000 sq. ft. building is expected to be completed and certified by the Chinese SFDA by March 2014. We will start planning and purchasing much of the equipment and tools necessary for the assembly and production of some of our Agro-Jet and Med-Jet products. The production facility should be able to supply a large number of injectors and disposables to the Chinese market.  Per the recent discussions and understanding of our general manager, Ethan Sun, with our Joint Venture partner, our plan of sales and expansion into the Chinese market is progressing and MIT China agreed and sold 9% of their joint venture for an investment of 18,000,000 RMB (US$3,000,000). MIT China now has 46.41%, we have 44.59%, and Taizhou Amazon Investment Center has 9% ownership in such venture.  Our objective is to ensure that our injectors become an indispensable and environmentally friendly product for doctors, dentists, veterinarians and home users around the world.  We will continue providing a safe and effective means to help prevent the spread of deadly diseases to both humans and animals through the use of the Med-Jet(R) and Agro-Jet(R) needle-free injection system.  Results of Operations  Results of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  For the three-month period ended June 30, 2016 the Company experienced a loss from operations of $169,661 which was primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses of $151,403 and sales of $50,875. Gross losses for the period were $18,258.  For the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 the Company experienced a profit from operations of $10,024 which was primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses of $91,057 and sales of $140,945. Gross profits for the period were $101,081.  The growing net loss between the comparable quarters was due to decreased sales as the Company continues to push its products into the market along with reduced research and development costs. Sales for the three-month period ending June 30, 2016 were $50,875 compared to sales of $140,945 for the same period last year. Gross loss for the period ending June 30, 2016 represented 36% of sales, where gross profits for the same period last year represented 72% of sales.

For the nine-month period ended June 30, 2015 the Company experienced a profit of $58,650 which was primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses of $258,896. Gross profits for the period were $317,546.  The growing net loss between the comparable quarters was due to decreased sales as the Company continues to push its products into the market along with reduced research and development costs. Sales for the nine-month period ending June 30, 2016 were $292,125 compared to sales of $439,249 for the same period last year. Gross profits for the period ending June 30, 2016 represented 51% of sales, where gross profits for the same period last year represented 72% of sales.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2016, the Company's cash position, including access to cash through a revolving line of credit, increased by $399,184. Net cash used in operating activities was $250,307. Cash used by investing activities was $45,124, which was primarily the result of $32,061 for the acquisition of new patent rights. Cash provided by financing activities was $668,019 which was primarily a result of an advance from a related party of $500,000 and a short term borrowing from an individual of $300,000. In addition repayments were made to the bank line of $74,663 and $57,318 to various other debt. The effect of exchange rates on cash increased cash balances by $26,596.  For the nine-month period ending June 30, 2015, the Company's cash position, including access to cash through a revolving line of credit, increased by $6,869. Net cash used in operating activities was $106,474. Cash provided by financing activities was $53,901 which was primarily a result of pay down of debt by $83,901. Cash used by investing activities was $34,452, which was a result of acquisitions of new patent rights. The effect of exchange rates on cash decreased cash balances by $11,252.  Plan of Operations  Medical International Technology's intends to concentrate its activities in the medical and veterinary sectors, in particular, in the field of equipment and instrumentation. The company's strategy is to build good, reliable and cost effective products, seek and establish strategic alliances with different pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers to ensure good distribution channels for its products.  MIT promotes and sells products in over 30 countries including the United States of America. MIT is exerting every effort and using its resources to promote its products and to open markets for its technology. As we continue to market our products, we hope to gain broader acceptance of the needle-free injection technology. MIT is continually researching and developing its products to the market needs.  We will continue to seek additional funding to expand operations and develop sales revenue to a volume sufficient to sustain operations and increase shareholders value.  Product Development  Per our previous fillings for FDA approval for our needle-free injector, the MED-JET is designed specifically for mass human inoculations. The MED-JET is capable of delivering many types of medications such as vaccines, insulin and other types of injectables. Its low-pressure technology offers an advantage to alternative high pressure systems that can cause blowbacks and expose medical workers and patients alike to microscopic traces of blood.  According to the International Sharps Injury Prevention Society (http://www.isips.org), it has been estimated that one out of every seven workers is accidentally struck by a contaminated sharp point each and every year. The Center for Disease Control (CDC:  The approval process can be expensive and may take an extended period of time. There can be no assurance that this system will receive approval from the FDA or if approved gain broad acceptance by the medical community or individual patients.  MIT's Needle-Free Injection System, designed specifically to allow fast, accurate and safe injections, is rapidly moving toward establishing itself as a valuable instrument in the fight against disease in both humans and animals. Spurred on by growing fears of a worldwide epidemic that could match or even exceed the deadly flu pandemic of 1918 which killed millions of people, the MIT team is focusing its efforts to make its Needle-Free Injection System available to the world.  MIT will increasingly promote its Agro-Jet needle-free injector. Having the same benefits as Med-Jet, Agro-Jet will become a valuable instrument in the fight against Avian Flu via its ability to mass inoculate animals at over 1000 injections per hour.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

A Little More Normal

“My entire world sort of clicked off. I didn't hear anything. I didn't see anything. And the only thing that I could think of was: I'm going to be dead in six months.”
This is James, looking back at 1988, the year the Dow closed above 2100, the Hubble Space Telescope was turned on, and James was diagnosed with HIV. “I'm a survivor of domestic violence, child molestation, depression,” he says with some pride. Even so, James knew he was about to enter the toughest fight of his life.
 After all, while HIV/AIDS awareness was still relatively new in 1988, James was seeing growing evidence of something much bigger. “First, there would be the fever and then there was the immense weight loss along with the Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions that would appear on the body,” James says. “A person would die and sometimes it would happen over a week.”
 James also explained that, since doctors had just begun researching HIV, there were almost no treatment options available. “The medication at the time was fairly nonexistent,” he recalls. Of the side effects, he says “the medication that they had at the time was even worse than the disease itself.”
 Thanks to years of investment and hard work by America’s biopharmaceutical companies, and other health care stakeholders, things have changed dramatically – and patients likes James, who can look back 29 years in near-disbelief, are proof.
 Brian, a researcher developing HIV/AIDS medications for nearly 20 years, is astounded by how far treatment has come. “The progress is actually quite miraculous,” he says. “In the early days, the goal was just keeping patients alive as long as possible.  Resistance was rampant and the regimens were not tolerable for many patients, but the alternative was death.  Frankly, both options were horrible.  Fast forward 30 years and now we have several one-pill, once-a-day treatment options for patients and their physicians to choose from.”  
 “They can live a normal life – a healthy, successful life.”
 Today, the outlook has never been more promising with more than 50 medicines and vaccines in development to treat, prevent, or help with the disease impact of HIV/AIDS.
 As Brian explains, treatment is no longer simply about survival, but enabling individuals to regain the quality of life they once had. “It is extremely motivating when we hear that a physician has a patient who is benefiting, that the new [medicines] we've brought forward have allowed the patient to regain weight, reverse the progression of their disease and essentially have a new life ahead of them.”
James understands the sentiment personally – and recognizes the network that helped him back. “My family, my doctors who were trying to make sure that I got the right medications to keep me going,” he says, “the programs that helped me find housing, sent me back to school, and helped me to better myself.” 
  “I have a great doctor. Most of doctors that I've had have been very good and this last one has been just fantastic.  We have gotten me to a point now where my numbers are just fantastic.”
 James’s experience motivated him to help others. He began volunteering at San Francisco City Hall by taking calls, helping around the office, and any job in between. This volunteer work led to HIV community activism – and a run for office. While he may not have won his election, James continued to give back to others, providing the same kind of support he is so thankful to have received. 
 James recently lost his partner to AIDS and his brother to cancer. Still, he knew he had to keep moving forward. 
 “The thing that gives me hope is just being able to wake up every day,” he says. “I will get back up.”
 Brian knows there’s still a long way to go. “There are people who are alive today because of the work that we do,” he acknowledges. “The work is often very quiet, very slow moving, very frustrating. But over time it has a major impact on thousands of people.”
And Brian sees even greater hope ahead.
“I don't take no for an answer,” he says. “The power of imagination and innovation is incredible and I see it every day in the eyes of my colleagues.”  “Science is real and the key to solving problems. We just need to find the right people to bring together, collaborate, and find a solution.”  
James is grateful for Brian’s – and many other researchers’ – tenacity. “I'm not sure how to explain it any better,” he says, “than it just makes me feel a little more normal.”
