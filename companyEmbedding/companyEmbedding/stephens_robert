Product Description

Stephens and Montgomery are talented young musicians who are equally at home with Bluegrass and Old-Time music.  Here in 15 cuts  they present a nice assortment of songs from such different sources as Charlie Poole, Uncle Dave Macon, The Lewis Family, Rebe & Rabe, Blind Alfred Reed, the Blue Sky Boys and Mac O’Dell. Stephens—who had a previous album of his own on Rebel—is a fine Scruggs style banjo picker, and Montgomery plays some clawhammer banjo as well as sharing guitar duties.  Performing in a “brother duet” style they present nice versions of songs like CAN YOU FORGIVE, LET’S PRAY, IT’S A GRAND & GLORIOUS FEELING, WHY NOT CONFESS, MATTHEW 24, OVER THE MOUNTAIN, etc.
