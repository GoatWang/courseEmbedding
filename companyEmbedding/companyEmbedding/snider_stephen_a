Dr. Stephen Snyder began practice with the Southern California Orthopedic Institute (SCOI) in 1981 as one of the five founding partners. He became interested in shoulder arthroscopy in 1982.
Since shoulder arthroscopy was a unfamiliar surgical procedure at the time, there was very little information available to guide an interested surgeon wishing to learn this new surgical discipline.  To enable the performance of arthroscopic repairs of ruptured rotator cuff and biceps tendons, as well as the reattachment of torn ligaments, Dr. Snyder partnered with several newly formed surgical equipment companies to develop a complete catalogue of novel miniature tools including suture anchors, stitching tools, tissue handling devices, arm support brackets, cannulas as well as a full line of shoulder braces and splints.

(A few of the 50+ surgical products Dr. Snyder has invented and co-developed)
These “inventions” along with many others are in use today, many in the second and third iterations and have catalyzed the development for numerous additional tools and techniques that have enhanced surgical outcomes.  
With these newly created tools available it now was possible to conceive, practice and perfect new surgical procedures.  Not only was Dr. Snyder instrumental in innovating the techniques for the now standard operations such as rotator cuff repairs, shoulder instability corrections and calcium and bone spur removal but when he found it necessary to devise a method to replace the massive non-repairable rotator cuff tendon the eventual solution was the GraftJacket Allograft soft tissue patch.  With this operation performed arthroscopically in the outpatient surgery, a tissue patch is sutured to the edges of the torn rotator cuff defect to close it and allow the body to actually regenerate a new cuff tendon.

(This is an example of a patient who had a massive tear of the rotator cuff tendon that has regenerated after placing a GraftJacket patch to fill in for the missing tendon.)
Early in his career, Dr. Snyder recognized the need to have better methods to train surgeons in the complex skills needed to perform shoulder arthroscopy. He determined that it would be useful to develop a realistic shoulder model with which students could practice and perfect the new techniques without potentially injuring the patients or the need for cadavers.  The product was completed in 1991 and was dubbed “Alex the Shoulder Professor” a realistic life-sized surgical model that is now used for surgeon training worldwide.  To enhance the product and make it available to every surgeon, a kit including an arthroscope, a light source, a coupler and an Internet video camera was developed thus enabling the use of a laptop computer in place of an expensive surgical set-up.

To further exchange new information with other surgeons around the world Dr. Snyder conceived and founded the Shoulder Arthroscopy Study Group, an association composed of shoulder arthroscopic surgeons from around the world.  The focus of the association was to share arthroscopic surgical cases on videotapes, DVDs and later Internet and thus facilitate learning new techniques.  With Dr. Snyder’s help and many other shoulder arthroscopy pioneers, this nascent society has bloomed into a successful Internet web site called VuMedi.com and is the leading source for shoulder arthroscopy teaching videos available.
  Dr. Snyder joined the Arthroscopy Association of North America in 1985 and was chosen to be the first to coordinator of the shoulder arthroscopy section. He later served as the Chairman of the Education Committee and the Treasurer of the Board of Directors. He is an active member of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Association, The 20th Century Orthopaedic Organization, The Western Orthopedic Association The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the Arthroscopy Association of North America.
Dr. Snyder is passionate about teaching and has traveled throughout the world as an invited lecturer to help others learn the art of shoulder arthroscopy.  He founded the SCOI CLASroom (Center for Learning Arthroscopic Skills) designed as a high-tech learning center for shoulder arthroscopy techniques using the Alex models and the latest “Virtual Reality” simulators. The CLASroom is located in the SCOI Van Nuys office and is frequented by student doctors from around the world without charge to facilitate their surgical training. In addition he is a senior member of the teaching faculty of the SCOI Sports Medicine Fellowship.

(CLASroom®- Center for Learning Arthroscopic Skills)
Dr. Snyder’s most notable contribution to shoulder arthroscopy education has been his sole authorship of the first two additions his textbooks, “SCOI Shoulder Arthroscopy”. The third edition, which is being co-authored by five of the SCOI shoulder partners, is being published in 2014.
Stephen J. Snyder, MD, is available to see patients in the Van Nuys office.

(Three editions of "SCOI Shoulder Arthroscopy" Textbook)
Outside of the office, Dr. Snyder enjoys fly-fishing, biking, exercising, traveling, video editing, hiking, reading and his new hobby is learning to fly remote control airplanes.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Fiction isn't about the facts of events, but rather about the emotional truths that come from being human. The best novels teach the reader things about themselves that they could never have learned from personal experience.Collect the Classics of LiteratureLiterature has been around almost as long as language has. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes are thousands of years old, and even those of Shakespeare are over four hundred. Antiquarian books not only look impressive on your bookshelf, but they let you see literature the way it was meant to be seen. They also make great collectibles, often growing in value over the years.Horror's One True KingFew names conjure a sense of horror on the page quite like Stephen King. Maine's prodigal son is one of the best known authors of the last half-century having written such bestsellers as "The Stand," "It," and "Salem's Lot." Known best for horror, King has the ability to capture an era of small town America like no author before or since. With King you can read the stories behind such movies as "Stand by Me," and even "The Shawshank Redemption."It's Just a Matter of GenreFrom romance to fantasy, and mystery to science fiction, fiction comes in a wide variety of genres. The beauty of reading genre fiction is that you always know what you're going to get. Every category romance has a happy ever after ending; that's the defining feature of the genre. Every mystery can be figured out through logical reasoning. It's all about finding the right story.Find the Right FormatFiction and Literature books come in three major formats: hardcover, trade paperback, and mass market paperback. Hardcovers are the largest, traditionally sewn together and built to last. Trade paperbacks are almost the size of hardcovers, and provide a balance between the bulk of a hardcover and the portability of a mass market paperback. Mass market paperbacks are the smallest of the three formats, designed to provide portable and often disposable fiction.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksFiction & Literature BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allAction, AdventureClassicsFantasyHorrorLiterature, ModernMystery, ThrillerRomanceScience FictionSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
