Local Matters to Us

Since 1923, Old Point has dedicated our efforts to the overall success of Hampton Roads. When our employees eat, shop, and celebrate, they choose local business first! We're showcasing small businesses in Hampton Roads and highlighting the tools that Old Point offers to expedite their success.
 
We hope you will be inspired by these stories and share your own on our Facebook page. When you eat, shop, or bank local, snap a picture and tag it #localmatterstous. Not every business can afford to advertise, but Hampton Roads can’t afford to lose them.
 
To learn more about how Old Point is making a difference in this community, check out our Facebook page, our Community Engagement Report or email us at talktous@oldpoint.com.  
 
"When local business thrives, we all succeed."
    -Rob Shuford Jr., President & CEO
