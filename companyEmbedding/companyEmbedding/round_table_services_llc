Disclosure  













          Disclosure    







 


Round Table Wealth Management ("Round Table") is an SEC registered investment advisor with locations in New York, New York and Westfield, New Jersey. Round Table and its representatives are in compliance with the current filing requirements imposed upon SEC registered investment advisors by those states in which Round Table maintains clients. Round Table may only transact business in those states in which it is registered, or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration requirements. Round Table's web site is limited to the dissemination of general information pertaining to its advisory services, together with access to additional investment-related information, publications, and links. Accordingly, the publication of Round Table's web site on the Internet should not be construed by any consumer and/or prospective client as Round Table's solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet. Any subsequent, direct communication by Round Table with a prospective client shall be conducted by a representative that is either registered or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration in the state where the prospective client resides. For information pertaining to the registration status of Round Table, please contact the SEC or the state securities law administrators for those states in which Round Table maintains a notice filing. A copy of Round Table's current written disclosure statement discussing Round Table's business operations, services, and fees is available from Round Table upon written request. Round Table does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any unaffiliated third party, whether linked to Round Table's web site or incorporated herein, and takes no responsibility therefor. All such information is provided solely for convenience purposes only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
Past performance may not be indicative of future results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance of any specific investment, investment strategy (including the investments and/or investment strategies recommended or undertaken by Round Table) or product made reference to directly or indirectly by Round Table in its web site, or indirectly via a link to an unaffiliated third party web site, will be profitable or equal the corresponding indicated performance level(s). Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client or prospective client's investment portfolio. Historical performance results for investment indices and/or categories generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges, the deduction of an investment management fee, nor the impact of taxes, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results.
Certain portions of Round Table's web site (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, Round Table's (and those of other investment and non-investment professionals) positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date. Due to various factors, including changing market conditions, such discussion may no longer be reflective of current position(s) and/or recommendation(s). Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from Round Table, or from any other investment professional. Round Table are neither attorneys nor accountants, and no portion of the web site content should be interpreted as legal, accounting or tax advice.
To the extent that any client or prospective client utilizes any economic calculator or similar device contained within or linked to Round Table's web site, the client and/ or prospective client acknowledges and understands that the information resulting from the use of any such calculator/device, is not, and should not be construed, in any manner whatsoever, as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized individual advice from Round Table, or from any other investment professional.
Each client and prospective client agrees, as a condition precedent to his/her/ its access to Round Table's web site, to release and hold harmless Round Table, its officers, directors, owners, employees and agents from any and all adverse consequences resulting from any of his/her/its actions and/or omissions which are independent of his/her/its receipt of personalized individual advice from Round Table.

        Collaborative Partners  
 We strive to make personal connections – as a client partner, an advisory team, and a leader of our clients’ professional service network. 
 This collaboration allows us to gain a comprehensive perspective on client goals, both the big picture and the small details, providing a focused framework to plan and execute integrated, goal-oriented strategies. With a heritage in delivering multi-family office services, we understand family dynamics. More often than not, we serve as statesmen, diplomatic representatives, and mediators on behalf of our clients. We know what questions to ask and how to navigate and simplify the complexities of wealth and financial desires. 



        High Standards  
 We instill integrity, honesty, and ethics into everything we do, from offering advice to selecting investments. 
 As stewards of wealth, we are objective in our guidance, clear in our purpose, and transparent in our fees. We are personalized, approachable, and responsive in our service. As fiduciaries, we endeavor to do what is best for the client, avoid conflicts of interest and offer unbiased insight and oversight. 



        Balanced Mindset  
 While we are disciplined in our approach, we are flexible and individualized in our thinking. 
 We take a long-term view of investing, but are proactive in capitalizing on appropriate short-term opportunities as we discover them. Our combination of institutional-class solutions and high-touch technical service offers our clients the best of both worlds: access to exclusive and global investments and broad expertise on a personal level. 



        Expansive Access  
 Our investments and clients span the globe. 
 We have broad expertise in both U.S. and non-U.S. tax matters as well as domestic and international investments. Our open architecture platform affords us access to a vast array of global investment options, and our extensive relationships and buying power provide exclusive access to institutional money managers and strategies not typically available to individual investors.
