      Excludes amortization of intangible assets (excluding software),
      gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, restructuring costs,
      impairment losses and other non-core items3
      Reconciliation between the definition of Core Operating Income and the
      previous definition is presented on page 24 Cash and
      cash equivalents, less bank overdrafts, bank loans and other financial
      liabilities and excluding financial derivative instruments
    


David Meek, Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen, stated: “Our
      performance in the first half of 2017 exceeded expectations, leading to
      an improved financial outlook for the full year. Sales grew in the first
      half by an impressive 19% year-on-year and core operating margin
      improved by 1.2 points, both driven by Specialty Care performance. In
      the second half of the year, we expect Somatuline® to
      continue along its positive growth trajectory and also an increasing
      contribution from our new products Cabometyx® in
      Europe and Onivyde® in the U.S. We remain focused on
      the successful execution of the commercial portfolio as well as the
      transformation of our R&D model to build an innovative and sustainable
      pipeline.”


Full year 2017 upgraded guidance



      Following the strong performance in the first half of 2017, the Group
      updates its financial targets for the full year 2017:
    


Specialty Care sales growth upgraded to greater than +24.0%,
        reflecting the strong momentum for Somatuline® and Cabometyx®;
      

Revised slight growth ofConsumer Healthcare, reflecting
        primarily lower sales expected in the second half for Prontalgine®
        following a decree from the French Minister of Health on July 12, 2017
        for all medicines containing codeine (e.g. Prontalgine®),
        dextromethorphan, ethylmorphine or noscapine to be available by
        prescription only to prevent misuse;
      

Core Operating Income margin upgraded to greater than 25.0%
        of sales, based on the improved sales guidance and assuming
        additional investments to support the Cabometyx® and Onivyde®
        launches, increased R&D spend and higher employee variable
        compensation.

Definition of Core Financial Measures



      Effective December 31st, 2016, Ipsen updated its definition
      of Core financial measures (Core Operating income, Core consolidated net
      profit, Core EPS) to exclude the amortization of intangible assets
      (excluding software) and the gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets.
    

      These performance indicators do not replace IFRS indicators, and should
      not be relied upon as such.
    

      Reconciliations between IFRS H1 2016/2017 results and the newly defined
      Core financial measures are presented in Appendix 4 and in the
      “Reconciliation from Core consolidated net profit to IFRS consolidated
      net profit” table on page 13.
    

      Below is a reconciliation of the Core Operating Income from the previous
      definition to the new reported definition:

Review of the first half 2017 results



Note: Unless stated otherwise, all variations in sales are stated
      excluding foreign exchange impacts.


Group sales reached €919.5 million, up 18.8% year-on-year.
    

Specialty Care
sales reached €764.6 million, up 23.1%,
      driven by the strong growth of Somatuline® and the
      contribution of €28.6 million of key new products Cabometyx®
      (mainly sales from Germany and France) and Onivyde® (with
      first sales booked in the second quarter following the closing of the
      transaction in early April 2017). Somatuline® growth of 31.8%
      was driven by a continued growth in North America, and a solid
      performance throughout Europe. Dysport® growth was fueled by
      the good performance of our partner Galderma in North America and Europe
      but still impacted by importation issues related to the temporary
      cancellation of the certificate of Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)
      in Brazil. Decapeptyl® sales reflect good volume growth in
      most geographies but also some continued price pressure, notably in
      China.
    


Consumer Healthcare

sales reached €154.8 million, driven
      by the good performance of Smecta® thanks to the retail
      strategy in China and a positive sales dynamic in Russia, as well as the
      contribution of the recent acquisitions of new OTC products (including
      Prontalgine® in France) and the new products from Akkadeas
      Pharma in Italy. This performance was partly offset by some continued
      pressure in emerging markets like Algeria and Russia.
    

Core Operating Income totaled €240.5 million, up 25.7%, driven by
      the strong Specialty Care sales growth and reflects increased commercial
      investments mainly for the new products Cabometyx® and Onivyde®.
    

Core operating margin reached 26.2% of sales, up 1.2 points.
    

Core consolidated net profit was €169.2 million, compared to
      €145.7 million in 2016, up 16.2% and impacted by higher financial and
      income tax expenses.
    

Fully diluted core earnings per share grew by 15.7% to reach
      €2.04, compared to €1.76 in 2016.
    

IFRS Operating income was €176.4 million, up 1.0% compared to
      €174.6 million in 2016 after higher amortization of intangible assets
      from Cabometyx® and Onivyde®, and costs associated
      primarily with Onivyde® integration and R&D restructuring
      expenses. Operating income margin at 19.2% is down 3.6 points compared
      to the first half of 2016.
    

IFRS Consolidated net profit was €125.9 million versus €133.3
      million in 2016 after higher financial and income tax expenses.
    

IFRS
Fully diluted EPS (Earning per share) was €1.52
      versus €1.61 in 2016.
    

Free cash flow reached €94.9 million, up by €21.3 million, driven
      by the improvement in Operating Cash Flow, partially compensated by
      higher restructuring costs and financial expenses.
    

Closing net debt reached €669.4 million at the end of June 2017,
      versus a cash position of €17.3 million at the end of June 2016
      reflecting the acquisitions completed during the first half of 2017 for
      Onivyde®, the Consumer Healthcare product portfolio and the
      equity stake in Akkadeas Pharma.

Forward Looking Statement


      The forward-looking statements, objectives and targets contained herein
      are based on the Group’s management strategy, current views and
      assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and
      uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to
      differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks
      could affect the Group’s future ability to achieve its financial
      targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions
      based on the information available today. Use of the words "believes,"
      "anticipates" and "expects" and similar expressions are intended to
      identify forward-looking statements, including the Group’s expectations
      regarding future events, including regulatory filings and
      determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were
      prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and
      potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These
      objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by
      the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen
      in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results
      may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of
      certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising
      product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never
      being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably
      for regulatory or competition reasons. The Group must face or might face
      competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of
      market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves
      several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the
      Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its
      efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant
      sums. Therefore, the Group cannot be certain that favorable results
      obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently
      during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be
      sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product
      concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the
      necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be
      commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or
      risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially
      from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and
      uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry
      conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest
      rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of
      pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global
      trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new
      products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new
      product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the
      Group's ability to accurately predict future market conditions;
      manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of
      international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the
      effectiveness of the Group’s patents and other protections for
      innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent
      litigation, and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third
      parties to develop and market some of its products which could
      potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave
      in such ways which could cause damage to the Group’s activities and
      financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will
      fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from
      those agreements. A default by any of the Group’s partners could
      generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a
      negative impact on the Group’s business, financial position or
      performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking
      to update or revise any forward looking statements, targets or estimates
      contained in this press release to reflect any change in events,
      conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements
      are based, unless so required by applicable law. The Group’s business is
      subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed
      with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and
      uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to
      refer to the Group’s 2016 Registration Document available on its website
      (www.ipsen.com).

1 New sales reporting according to the main therapeutic
      indication of each product
    

      Sales amounted to €919.5 million, up 18.8% year-on-year, driven by 23.1%

      equity stake in Akkadeas Pharma in 2017, and a good sales dynamic in

Sales



      For the six months ended 30 June 2017, the Group's consolidated sales
      came to €919.5 million, up 20.4% year-on-year and up 18.8% excluding the
      impact of foreign exchange.
    


Other revenues



      Other revenues for the first half of 2017 totaled €50.2 million, up
      17.4% versus €42.8 million generated in the six-month period ended 30
      June 2016.
    

      The evolution was attributable to higher royalties received from Group
      partners, mainly Galderma for Dysport® and Menarini for
      Adenuric®.
    


Cost of goods sold



      For the six months ended 30 June 2017, Cost of goods sold amounted to
      €190.2 million, representing 20.7% of sales compared to €172.2 million,
      or 22.5% of sales, in the six-month period ended 30 June 2016.
    

      The improvement in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was
      mainly driven by a favorable product mix from the growth in Specialty
      Care sales. Royalties paid to partners increased due to the growth of
      Group sales.
    


Selling expenses



      For the six months ended 30 June 2017, Selling expenses came to €349.6
      million, representing 38.0% of sales, up 23.5% versus the six months
      ended 30 June 2016. The increase reflects the commercial efforts
      deployed to support the Cabometyx® launch in Europe, the
      growth of Somatuline® in the United States as well as the
      commercial investment for Onivyde® in the United States after
      the closing of the acquisition in April.
    


Research and development expenses



      For the half-year period ended 30 June 2017, Research and development
      expenses totaled €115.0 million, compared to €95.0 million in the same
      period in 2016.
    

      The Group is strengthening its Oncology capabilities and increased
      development costs for Cabometyx®, the peptide receptor
      radionuclide therapy program and Onivyde®. In Neurosciences,
      the short acting toxin entered into the clinical phase, leading to a
      progressive increase of costs.
    

      At 30 June 2017, the research tax credit amounted to €13.3 million, up
      €0.9 million versus 2016.
    


General and administrative expenses



      For the six months ended 30 June 2017, General and administrative
      expenses came to €68.3 million, up €9.2 million versus the same period
      in 2016. The increase resulted primarily from the strengthening of the
      structure to support the Onivyde® acquisition in the United
      States as well as to the impact of the Group’s positive performance on
      variable compensation.
    


Other core operating income and expenses



      In the first half of 2017, Other core operating expenses totaled €6.0
      million, in line with the first half of 2016.
    


Core Operating Income



      Core Operating Income in the first half of 2017 came to €240.5 million,
      representing 26.2% of sales, compared to €191.3 million in Core
      Operating Income in the first half of 2016, representing 25.0% of sales.
      The strong performance of Specialty Care including the contribution from
      new products Cabometyx® and Onivyde®, combined
      with higher commercial investments enabled the Group to increase its
      profitability by 1.2 points. The growth of Core Operating Income between
      the first half of 2017 and 2016 reached 25.7%.
    


Net financing costs and Other financial income and expense



      In the first half of 2017, the Group incurred net financial expenses of
      €11.6 million, versus €2.9 million in the first half of 2016.
    

      Net financing costsamounted to €4.2 million, versus €1.1 million
      in 2016, driven by interest expenses on the bond issued in June 2016 and
      by financing costs related to the acquisitions completed during this
      semester.
    

      In the first half of 2017, Other financial income and expense
      amounted to an expense of €7.5 million, compared to €1.8 million in the
      first half of 2016, driven by the cost of hedging implemented to
      mitigate the foreign exchange risk of the Group.
    


Core income taxes



      In the first half of 2017, Core income tax expense of €60.7 million
      resulted from a core effective tax rate of 26.5% on pre-tax profit
      compared to a core effective rate of 23.4% in 2016. This increase is
      mainly attributable to the increase of unrecognized deferred tax assets
      in the United States and Germany.
    


Core consolidated net profit



      For the six months ended 30 June 2017, Core consolidated net profit
      increased by 16.2% to €169.2 million, fully attributable to Ipsen S.A.
      shareholders. This compares to Core consolidated net profit of €145.7
      million, with €145.3 million attributable to Ipsen S.A. shareholders, at
      the end of June 2016.
    


Core Earning per share



      At the end of June 2017, Core EPS fully diluted came to €2.04, up 15.7%
      versus €1.76 per share at the end of June 2016.
    

From Core financial measures to IFRS reported figures


      Reconciliations between IFRS 2016 / 2017 half-year results and the Core
      financial measures are presented in Appendix 4.
    

      In the first half of 2017, the main reconciling items between Core
      consolidated net income and IFRS consolidated net income were:
    


Amortization of intangible assets (excluding software)



      Amortization of intangible assets (excluding software) for the six
      months ended 30 June 2017 amounted to €21.5 million before tax, compared
      to €2.2 million before tax in the first half of 2016. This variance
      consisted mainly of the amortization of the intangible assets for
      Cabometyx® and Onivyde®.
    


Other operating income and expenses and Restructuring costs



      Other non-core operating expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2017
      amounted to €34.8 million before tax and Restructuring costs came to
      €7.9 million before tax.
    

      Those expenses consisted mainly of integration costs related to the
      Onivyde® acquisition, the adaptation of the R&D structure and
      programs and a settlement with a partner in Japan.
    

      In the first half of 2016, Other non-core operating expenses totaled
      €5.8 million before tax and consisted mainly of costs from the change in
      the Group’s corporate governance and costs from the move to the new
      research and development site in Oxford, UK. Restructuring costs were
      €0.4 million before tax at the end of June 2016.
    


Impairment losses



      In the first half of 2017, no impairment loss was recognized in the
      Group accounts.
    

      In the first half of 2016, Ipsen recorded an impairment for €8.4 million
      before tax, on MCNA intangible assets acquired from Telesta Therapeutics.
    


Other



      In the first half of 2017, Other items amounted to €1.6 million and was
      related to discontinued operations, while in the first half of 2016,
      Other items amounted to € 0.3 million.
    

      As a consequence, IFRS reported indicators are:
    


Operating income



      In the first half of 2017, Operating income totaled €176.4 million in
      line with last year, with an Operating margin at 19.2%, down 3.7 points
      compared to the first half of 2016.
    


Consolidated net profit

      by 5.5% versus last year at €133.3 million.
    


Earning per share



      Fully diluted EPS was €1.52 at 30 June 2017 versus €1.61 last year.
    

Operating segments: Core Operating Income by therapeutic area


      Segment information is presented according to the Group's two operating
      segments, Specialty Care and Consumer Healthcare.
    

      All costs allocated to these two segments are presented in the key
      performance indicators. Only corporate overhead costs and the impact of
      the currency hedging policy are not allocated to the two operating
      segments. Research and development costs are allocated to the operating
      segments while formerly included in Unallocated.
    

      The Group uses Core Operating Income to measure its segment performance
      and to allocate resources.

      For the half year period ended 30 June 2017, Specialty Care sales
      grew to €764.6 million, up 24.6% over the first six months of 2017 (or
      23.1% at constant exchange rate), driven by the contribution of the two
      new products Onivyde® and Cabometyx® and the
      strong growth of Somatuline®. The relative weight of
      Specialty Care products continued to increase, reaching 83.2% of total
      consolidated sales at 30 June 2017, versus 80.3% a year earlier. In the
      first half of 2017, Core Operating Income for Specialty Care
      amounted to €281.3 million, representing 36.8% of sales. This compares
      to €214.8 million in the prior-year period, representing 35.0% of sales.
      The improvement reflects Somatuline® continued sales growth
      in the United States and Europe and the Cabometyx® and Onivyde®
      incremental sales, along with increased commercial investments to
      support growth and launches.
    

      For the six months ended 30 June 2017, sales of Consumer Healthcare
      products came to €154.8 million, up 3.0% year on year, driven by the
      good performance of Smecta® and the portfolio of Sanofi
      products acquired in May 2017. In the first half of 2017, Core
      Operating Income for Consumer Healthcare amounted €47.1 million,
      representing 30.4% of sales in comparison of 35.8% at 30 June 2016. This
      variance reflects the commercial efforts deployed to support the
      implementation of the OTx strategy as well as an increase in medical
      studies expenses.
    

      In the first half of 2017, Unallocated Core Operating Income came
      to a negative €87.8 million, compared to a negative €77.3 million in the
      year-earlier period. The evolution is mainly attributable to the Group’s
      positive performance on higher variable compensation and investments to
      support Ipsen’s growth. These expenses consisted mainly of unallocated
      corporate expenses and of the impact from the currency hedging policy.
    

Net cash flow and financing


      In the first half of 2017, the Group had a net cash decrease of €738.0
      million after the acquisition of the Onivyde® assets, OTC
      products portfolio including Prontalgine® and the equity
      stake in Akkadeas Pharma, bringing closing net debt to €669.4 million.

Operating cash flow



      At 30 June 2017, Operating Cash Flow totaled €143.4 million, up €26.4
      million (+22.6%) versus 30 June 2016. The increase was driven by higher
      Core Operating Income, partially offset by an increase in working
      capital requirement (WCR) and net capital expenditure (excluding
      milestones paid).
    

      Working capital requirement for operating activities increased by €35.4
      million at 30 June 2017, compared with an increase of €26.3 million at
      30 June 2016. The change at 30 June 2017 stemmed mainly from the
      following:
    


        A €19.5 million rise in inventories during the first half, in step
        with business growth and recent acquisitions;
      

        A €34.0 million increase in trade receivables in line with sales
        growth, to compare to a €22.4 million increase in trade receivables at
        the end of June 2016;
      

        A €18.1 million increase in trade payables at end of June 2017 in
        correlation with the phasing of operating expenses mainly to support
        the growth of the business. At the end of June 2016, trade payables
        rose by €3.1 million.
      


      In the first half of 2017, other WCR need increased by €20.0 million.
      This increase was mainly driven by negative seasonality on working
      capital components (including the payment of variable compensation and
      VAT), partially compensated by the reimbursement of R&D tax credit. The
      other WCR increased by €8.9 million in the first half of 2016.
    

      Net capital expenditure advanced €2.3 million year-on-year to €37.2
      million at 30 June 2017. These investments were aimed at reinforcing the
      production capacity at the United Kingdom and France industrial sites.
    


Free cash flow



      At 30 June 2017, Free Cash Flow came to €94.9 million, up €21.3 million
      (+28.9%) versus 30 June 2016. This evolution is mainly driven by an
      improvement in Operating Cash Flow, partially compensated by higher
      Other operating income or expenses and restructuring costs, and
      increased Financial expenses.
    

      Other non-core operating income and expenses and restructuring costs of
      €18.3 million included Onivyde® integration costs as well as
      the impact of the transformation of the R&D model. At the end of June
      2016, €10.2 million of such payments were primarily comprised in costs
      arising from the change in corporate governance, as well as payments for
      earlier restructuring plans that were staggered over several fiscal
      periods.
    

      The €9.1 million in financial expenses paid at end June 2017 resulted
      from interests on the bond issued in June 2016 and hedging costs. In
      comparison, the €2.3 million in financial income collected at end June
      2016 resulted mainly from the collection of dividends, an earnout
      payment related to the sale of Spirogen shares and realized foreign
      exchange gains.
    

      The change in current income tax stemmed mainly from the change in the
      effective tax rate.
    


Shareholders return and external growth operations



      At 30 June 2017, the dividend payout to Ipsen S.A. shareholders amounted
      to €70.2 million.
    

      Net investments at 30 June 2017 amounted to €760 million, including the
      acquisition of Onivyde® assets from Merrimack Pharmaceuticals
      on April 3rd for €666 million including the purchase price
      and future earn-outs (discounted and probabilized under IFRS), the
      acquisition of Consumer Healthcare products in European territories from
      Sanofi for €86 million and the equity stake in Akkadeas Pharma for €5
      million as well as an additional commercial milestone paid to Exelixis
      for €9 million following the exclusive licence agreement signed in 2016.
      This was partially offset by a €8 million regulatory milestone payment
      received from Radius.
    

      At 30 June 2016, net financial investments mainly encompassed a €184
      million upfront payment to Exelixis for the exclusive licensing
      agreement for cabozantinib and a €5 million upfront payment to 3B
      Pharmaceuticals GmbH, partially offset by regulatory milestone payments
      received from Acadia and Radius (€10 million) and by scheduled payments
      related to the agreement signed with Galderma in December 2015 for
      Asia-Pacific markets (€7 million).

      (a) Impact of change in consolidation scope reflects the recent
      acquisitions of Onivyde® assets from Merrimack
      Pharmaceuticals and the equity stake in Akkadeas Pharma.
    

      (b) Milestones paid correspond to payments subject to the terms and
      conditions set out in the Group's partnership agreements. The €9 million
      milestone paid to Exelixis accounted for the majority of the milestones
      paid at 30 June 2017. The amounts paid were recorded as an increase in
      intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The transactions
      were included in the "Acquisition of intangible assets" line item in the
      consolidated statement of cash flow (see Appendix 3.1).
    

      (c)Milestones received are amounts collected by Ipsen from
      its partners. The €8 million milestone received at 30 June 2017 were
      paid by Radius. The amounts were recorded as deferred income in the
      consolidated balance sheet and then recognized in the income statement
      as "Other revenues". Milestones received were included in the "Net
      change in other operating assets and liabilities" line item in the

        team provided a comprehensive update on its current business,
        corporate strategy and outlook. In Specialty Care, Ipsen is focused on
        three key therapeutic areas, Oncology, Neurosciences and Rare
        diseases, where Ipsen can establish a leadership position and leverage
        its expertise from drug development to commercialization. To build a
        sustainable pipeline of innovative assets, Ipsen will transform the
        R&D model and continue to invest in business development. In Consumer

        will complete the OTx model transformation and leverage the three main
        market-leading brands through consumer innovations, capture the
        underlying market growth in emerging markets and strengthen the

APPENDIX


RISK FACTORS


      The Group operates in an environment which is undergoing rapid change
      and exposes its operations to a number of risks, some of which are
      outside its control. The risks and uncertainties set out below are not
      exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the Group’s 2016
      Registration Document available on its website (www.ipsen.com).
    


        The Group is faced with uncertainty in relation to the prices set for
        all its products, in so far as medication prices have come under
        severe pressure over the last few years as a result of various
        factors, including the tendency for governments and payers to reduce
        prices or reimbursement rates for certain drugs marketed by the Group
        in the countries in which it operates, or even to remove those drugs
        from lists of reimbursable drugs.
      

        The Group depends on third parties to develop and market some of its
        products, which generates or may generate substantial royalties for
        the Group, but these third parties could behave in ways that cause
        damage to the Group’s business. The Group cannot be certain that its
        partners will fulfill their obligations. It might be unable to obtain
        any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group’s
        partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations
        could have a negative impact on the Group’s business, financial
        position or performance.
      

        Actual results may depart significantly from the objectives given that
        a new product can appear to be promising at a development stage, or
        after clinical trials, but never be launched on the market, or be
        launched on the market but fail to sell, notably for regulatory or
        competitive reasons.
      

        The Research and Development process typically lasts between eight and
        twelve years from the date of discovery to a product being brought to
        market. This process involves several stages; at each stage, there is
        a substantial risk that the Group could fail to achieve its objectives
        and be forced to abandon its efforts in respect of products in which
        it has invested significant amounts. Thus, in order to develop viable
        products from a commercial point of view, the Group must demonstrate,
        by means of pre-clinical and clinical trials, that the molecules in
        question are effective and are not harmful to humans. The Group cannot
        be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials
        will subsequently be confirmed during clinical trials, or that the
        results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the
        safety and efficacy of the product in question such that the required
        marketing approvals can be obtained.
      

        The Group must deal with or may have to deal with competition (i) from
        generic products, particularly in relation to Group products which are
        not protected by patents (ii), products which, although they are not
        strictly identical to the Group’s products or which have not
        demonstrated their bioequivalence, may obtain a marketing
        authorization for indications similar to those of the Group’s products
        pursuant to the bibliographic reference regulatory procedure (well
        established medicinal use) before the patents protecting its products
        expire. Such a situation could result in the Group losing market share
        which could affect its current level of growth in sales or
        profitability.
      

        Third parties might claim the benefit of intellectual property rights
        with respect to the Group’s inventions. The Group provides the third
        parties with which it collaborates (including universities and other
        public or private entities) with information and data in various forms
        relating to the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of
        its products. Despite the precautions taken by the Group with regard
        to these entities, in particular of a contractual nature, they (or
        certain of their members or affiliates) could claim ownership of
        intellectual property rights arising from the trials carried out by
        their employees or any other intellectual property right relating to
        the Group’s products or molecules in development.
      

        The Group’s strategy includes acquiring companies or assets which may
        enable or facilitate access to new markets, research projects or
        geographical regions or enable the Group to realize synergies with its
        existing businesses. Should the growth prospects or earnings potential
        of such assets as well as valuation assumptions change materially from
        initial assumptions, the Group might be under the obligation to adjust
        the values of these assets in its balance sheet, thereby negatively
        impacting its results and financial situation.
      

        The marketing of certain products by the Group has been and could be
        affected by supply shortages and other disruptions. Such difficulties
        may be of both a regulatory nature (the need to correct certain
        technical problems in order to bring production sites into compliance
        with applicable regulations) and a technical nature (difficulties in
        obtaining supplies of satisfactory quality or difficulties in
        manufacturing active ingredients or drugs complying with their
        technical specifications on a sufficiently reliable and uniform
        basis). This situation may result in inventory shortages and/or in a
        significant reduction in the sales of one or more products.
      

        In certain countries exposed to significant public deficits, and where
        the Group sells its drugs directly to public hospitals, the Group
        could face discount or lengthened payment terms or difficulties in
        recovering its receivables in full. The Group closely monitors the
        evolution of the situation in Southern Europe where hospital payment
        terms are especially long. More generally, the Group may also be
        unable to purchase sufficient credit insurance to protect itself
        adequately against the risk of payment default from certain customers
        worldwide. Such situations could negatively impact the Group’s
        activities, financial situation and results.
      

        In the normal course of business, the Group is or may be involved in
        legal or administrative proceedings. Financial claims are or may be
        brought against the Group in connection with some of these proceedings.
      

        The cash pooling arrangements for foreign subsidiaries outside the
        euro zone expose the Group to financial foreign exchange risk. The
        variation of these exchange rates may impact significantly the Group’s

Visitor and community survey results for Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge: Completion reportProduct Type: Open-file ReportYear: 2007Author(s): Sexton, N.R., S.C. Stewart, L. Koontz, P. Ponds, and K.D. WaltersSuggested Citation: Sexton, N.R., S.C. Stewart, L. Koontz, P. Ponds, and K.D. Walters. 2007. Visitor and community survey results for Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge: Completion report. Open-File Report 2007-1239. Fort Collins, CO: U. S. Geological Survey, Fort Collins Science Center. 222 p. This study was commissioned by the Northeast Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in support of the Comprehensive Conservation Planning at Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge (Prime Hook NWR or Refuge). The National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-57, USC668dd) mandates a Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) for every refuge in the system. A refuge CCP outlines goals, objectives, and management strategies for all refuge programs over the next 15 years, while providing opportunities for compatible, wildlife-dependent public uses. The plan evaluates refuge wildlife, habitat, land protection, and visitor service priorities during the planning process.

Jefa Rudder & Rudder Bearings on Display at Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show 2017HomeFort Lauderdale International Boat Show 2017Products on DisplayJefa Rudder & Rudder BearingsJefa Rudder & Rudder BearingsPYI Inc. offers a full line of Jefa rudder systems products for your sailboat. Jefa rudder bearings offer the utmost in feel and durability. Utilizing captive roller bearings in rugged aluminum housings, there is a full range of sizes and styles including self aligning bearings to suit all sizes of sailboats. Sizes are available from 30 mm to 260 mm for production and custom applications.

Also available are Jefa rudders. Jefa produces a wide range of rudder blades for boats from 22 to 60 feet in length. This unique product line offers the boat builder a modern rudder blade without investing in expensive molds.

As every rudder stock is different we always produce them to the specific customer requirements. In general the designer of the yacht specifies the material and dimensions. We can assist with the calculation of different material that would be required or if the design has to be modified for a more economic production.
