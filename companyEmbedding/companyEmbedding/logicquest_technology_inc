We will pay for the cost of registering the shares of common stock in this
offering. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by
the Selling Stockholders. However, we may receive proceeds from the exercise of
the options and warrants overlying the common stock. If all the options and
warrants overlying the common stock in this offering, we will receive proceeds
in the aggregate amount of $19,234,000. We will use such proceeds, if received,
for general corporate purposes and working capital.


Many of our competitors have greater financial, marketing and information
technology resources than we do. The current scope of our operations is limited
to Texas, Louisiana and Illinois. We could easily lose our first-to-market
advantage if larger competitors aggressively entered the HIPAA compliance
marketplace.


Company Description
Our Web site is www.bluegate.com. In the Company’s Form 10-KSB, we refer to
ourselves as "Bluegate", "We", Us", “the Company”, and "Our." References to our
common stock herein give effect to our 20:1 reverse stock split which occurred
in 2004. In 2004, we took corporate action to increase the


 number of our
authorized shares of common stock to be 50,000,000 shares of common stock.

Our executive offices are located at: Bluegate Corporation, 701 North Post Oak
Road, Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77024, tel. voice: 713-686-1100,
fax: 713-682-7402. Our Web site is www.bluegate.com.

Our growth is dependent on attaining profit from our operations and our raising
capital through the sale of stock or debt. There is no assurance that we will be
able to raise any equity financing or sell any of our products at a profit.

Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Our independent auditors issued a
going concern qualification in their report dated March 12, 2007, which raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our stock is
traded on the OTCBB. Our trading symbol is "BGAT."
