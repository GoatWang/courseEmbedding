The Jacada Contact Hub

Click any of the three contact methods to learn how Jacada’s Solutions can improve customer interactions. 

 












Overview
There are three primary contact methods your customers who remotely engage your business often use - A voice inquiry is the first and still most widely used, second is some sort of online web session like your website or social platform, and the third is responding to some sort of outbound communication. Jacada’s solutions work with each of these three primary contact methods to deliver a unique and successful digital self-service experience. We uniquely provide the capabilities of digital self-service to inbound callers, assign an intelligent virtual assistant to accompany your online customers, and guide customers through an interaction flow when responding to outbound communications. Hover over each communication channel to learn more.
Select each of the three contact methods to learn how Jacada’s Solutions can improve customer interactions.






Voice = Visual IVR
Even though the phone channel is the most expensive, majority of consumers still prefer to talk to agents via phone. Thus, the voice channel isn’t going anywhere anytime soon when it comes to call centers.
Deliver a personalized and digital experience to your voice callers, enabling a better customer experience with improved self-service. Visual IVR transforms your Voice IVR into a digital experience, improving self-service by over 10% based on our implementations at Fortune 500 companies globally. Visual IVR also allows customers to transition from the digital channel to the agent with full context resulting in significantly reduced handle times.

Digital = Intelligent Assistant
Digital channels consist of an organizations website, mobile app, social platforms, forums, messaging, among many other “digital” paths. Our Intelligent Assistant is your customer’s personal helper when interacting through this contact method.
Jacada Intelligent Assistant is an interactive virtual agent that is capable of assisting your customers simple or complex inquiries through a chat based interface that customers prefer. The Intelligent Assistant goes far beyond simple question-answer – Through a conversational type dialog with the customer, the Intelligent Assistant is able to understand the intent and sentiment and translate this to actionable transactions.

Outbound = Proactive Outbound Engagement

Jacada Outbound Engagement allows organizations to proactively communicate with their customers, regardless of the channel, to improve customer satisfaction and promote valuable long term customer relationships. Event based outbound engagement has proven highly beneficial for both the business and the customer.

Overview
Delivering an exceptional customer service experience in the digital world appears to be a dichotomy. On the one hand, the digital customer is demanding efficiency in their interactions with your company. Whether it’s a digital session, a voice call or even a proactive outbound notification, they demand the interactions be low effort, efficient and on the channel of their choice. Companies, on the other hand, want to ensure low inbound call volume and next issue avoidance all while delivering an exceptional customer experience. Explore how Jacada solves the customer experience paradox!

					Full Description



Jacada Ltd. (Jacada), incorporated on December 19, 1990, is a software company. The Company develops, markets and supports unified service desktop process optimization, and omnichannel solutions that automates customer service processes and interactions across various channels, including mobile, Web, voice and chat. The Company provides an omnichannel solution, which is a digital interaction platform to bridge the voice and digital disconnect and create cross channel interactions for an enterprise's customers. The Company also provides software for the contact center to develop the productivity of an enterprise's contact centers agents. The Company's products include Jacada WorkSpace Agent Desktop, Jacada Visual IVR, Jacada Advisor, Jacada Integration and Automation (JIA), Jacada Agent Scripting, Jacada Workflow, Jacada HostFuse, Jacada Interface Server and Jacada Multi-Channel Agent Desktop. The Company's professional services include training, consulting services (which include installation, implementation, integration and customization of its solutions), solution support and maintenance services and product support and maintenance services. The Company's principal markets are North America and Europe.Jacada WorkSpace Agent DesktopJacada WorkSpace Agent Desktop is a built for purpose solution that unifies customer interaction tools and provides a single access point to all the mission-critical applications required by the customer service representatives to complete a customer interaction. Jacada Workspace Agent Desktop delivers a range of capabilities that enable companies to implement optimal contact center processes. Jacada workspace agent desktop provides an agent with a single interface to access the multitude of disparate systems and resources needed to perform his or her job. In addition, by using role-based desktop controls, Jacada Workspace Agent Desktop enables companies to transform product-specific or function-specific agents to universal agents.Jacada Visual IVRJacada Visual IVR enables end users to engage in a mobile self-service session through smart phones, tablets or other smart devises, which visually maps out the steps of the customer service interaction. This visual interaction, or Visual IVR, has full support for data entry and self-service capabilities, including being able to mine knowledge bases for information and retrieve or update customer information in real time. Jacada Visual IVR connects the customer's self-serve interaction directly with a company's underlying line of business applications to solve their problem. For calls that do require agent assistance, Jacada Visual IVR provides a seamless transition to the voice or chat channel from the self-service channel. Once the call is connected to the agent, all of the steps already taken by the customer, as well as any data entered, are visible to the agent.Jacada AdvisorJacada Advisor helps call centers improve customer service by providing real-time agent guidance, simplifying applications and automating redundant or repetitive tasks. Jacada Advisor works by capturing processes performed on an application and then automating all or parts of the process. Agents can be guided as to the next action to perform using small pop-up's or bubbles that are provided in real-time in context to the action being performed. In addition, Jacada Advisor monitors the activities of an agent in an application and automatically automates routine tasks, as and when appropriate.Jacada Integration and Automation (JIA)Jacada Integration and Automation is a non-invasive integration solution that allows companies to Web-enable and integrate their Microsoft Windows client/server and Web-based applications without modifying or changing anything in the existing application. Jacada Integration and Automation enables organizations to leverage their existing Windows client/server and Web-based applications to automate business processes and seamlessly integrate and transfer data from one application to another. Jacada Integration and Automation works with graphic user interface technologies (Web and Windows-based), which enables it to automate Windows/Web applications.Jacada Integration and Automation Web service enables Windows client/server or Web-based applications. Without changing anything in the original application, and without needing to access the source code, Jacada Integration and Automation enables organizations to automate interactions with their applications and drives the system as a user would navigate a series of Windows forms or Web pages, and inserts or retrieves data as required. Jacada Integration and Automation exposes these interactions as Web services that can be integrated into any J2EE or .NET composite application.Jacada Agent ScriptingJacada Agent Scripting guides the customer service agent through an optimized interaction with the customer. A contact center interaction contains elements of guidance language presented to the agent as a practice suggestion regarding how to answer the customer's inquiry; mandatory language that must be read for compliance reasons; business rules to determine what the agent may offer or do next, and workflow between these steps to ensure that all necessary information is gathered and presented to the customer. Jacada agent scripting deploys in conjunction with Jacada workspace ensuring cooperation between the customer interaction workflow and the multiple business systems controlled by Jacada workspace.Jacada WorkflowJacada Workflow creates business process management (BPM) workflows, which ensure that work items in the contact center that require interaction from another person or special handling are routed, tracked, assigned and responded to in an organized and monitored manner. This ensures that sensitive and urgent business processes, such as damage claims in the insurance industry or special requests to change a retail order already in the shipping process are routed to the correct person and that they are followed up on completely in an appropriate amount of time. This ensures that customer interactions that are outside the scope or ability of a customer service agent to handle may be treated with the same efficiency, rigor and process that is followed in the contact center.Jacada HostFuseJacada HostFuse is a software solution for integrating host-centric business systems, including the data and processes in those systems, with multiple packaged applications, frameworks and client environments. Jacada HostFuse provides on-line, real-time integration with back-office applications without rewriting any of the existing systems.Jacada Interface ServerJacada Interface Server generates graphical user interfaces for mainframe and midrange software applications without requiring any change to the host applications. By generating Java or hypertext markup language (HTML) graphical interfaces, Jacada Interface Server enables its customers to extend their host-centric applications and data to the Internet and their intranets without rewriting these applications. Jacada Interface Server also allows customers to enhance their applications to add functionality, integrate with other data sources and link to other Internet applications.Jacada Multi-Channel Agent DesktopThe Jacada Multi-channel Agent Desktop is a drop in replacement for the existing Avaya Elite Multi-channel desktop (EMC). Jacada Multi-channel Agent Desktop offers multi context, in which agents are able to simultaneously manage multiple customers across multiple EMC channels from a unified desktop reflecting a single view of the customer and the channel in use for each and every call; multi-channel, which unifies EMC channels (Voice, E-mail, Chat) onto a single desktop, and thin client, which is a lightweight user interface, ready to go out of the box and certified on the Avaya platform.The Company competes with OpenSpan, NICE Systems, Pega Systems, Cicero, Voxeo, Fonolo, CallVU, Interactive Intelligence, CafeX, 24/7 and Genesys.

UK University Implements Jacada Ticket Guidance to Streamline Admissions Processing
Oct 27 16
Jacada Ltd. announced that the top university in the UK'sEast Midlands, Derby University, has selected Jacada Ticket Guidance as a Zendesk-integrated solution to assist the organization's Admissions and Marketing departments during student recruitment. Clearing, which is a key recruitment period for Derby, is managed by the Admissions and Marketing team, but due to the large scale operation, staff from across all departments of the University also support the process during the main enrollment period. The Challenge was to ensure that supporting staff from other departments who may not have any, or only minimal prior experience with Clearing processes and procedures, were fully trained to offer a great Customer Experience and also ensure that Zendesk was updated correctly following the outcome of a call with the applicant. Selected because of its certified ticket guidance integration with Zendesk, Jacada Agent Scripting is being utilized by approximately 400 users during the Clearing period and by several different roles in the Clearing process, with as many as 300 concurrent users during peak times. Each user was able to quickly get up-to-speed with Zendesk procedures and Clearing processes for each user's role. Several of the benefits of using Jacada Agent Scripting as listed by the University are: The Scripting was able to be integrated within Zendesk, so users were able to follow the scripts within the same screen whilst updating Zendesk and the applicant's processes; The Scripting functionality was easy to use and very clear to follow for the user; Scripts were easy to amend/update as required and then install; Clearing training was performed efficiently and effectively with the help and support of the Agent Script processes; The Scripts helped give self-assurance to the user on applying the processes for the end user as well as the organization; and the Scripts were a guide for the efficient use of Zendesk benefiting the University as well as the end user.

There are three primary contact methods your customers who remotely engage your business often use - A voice inquiry is the first and still most widely used, second is some sort of online web session like your website or social platform, and the third is responding to some sort of outbound communication. Jacada’s solutions work with each of these three primary contact methods to deliver a unique and successful digital self-service experience. We uniquely provide the capabilities of digital self-service to inbound callers, assign an intelligent virtual assistant to accompany your online customers, and guide customers through an interaction flow when responding to outbound communications. Hover over each communication channel to learn more.

Companies, on the other hand, want to ensure low inbound call volume and next issue avoidance all while delivering an exceptional customer experience.

History[edit]
Jacada was founded in 1990 under the company name Client/Server Technology. The original vision of the company was to help organizations leverage and re-use their significant investments in legacy systems.
In 1997 the company introduced its first Java-based web-to-host product branded "Jacada". In 1999, Jacada changed the company name from Client/Server Technology Ltd. to Jacada Ltd. Jacada went public in October 1999, and its shares are traded on Nasdaq under the symbol "JCDA."[2]
In January 2008 Jacada sold its "legacy" business to Software AG for $26 million in cash. [3] This transaction included the intellectual property and related customer contracts associated with the Jacada "legacy" products [Terminal Emulator, Jacada Studio, Jacada Innovator, Jacada Interface Server and Jacada Integrator]. Under the terms of the transaction, Jacada retained the right to develop, market, sell and support Jacada Interface Server and Jacada HostFuse in support of its call center solutions business.[4]

Transactional Self-Service
Transactional self-service is the modern day answer to the knowledge base. Instead of static text articles that are merely “how-to’s”, transactional self-service guides customers every step of the way in a transactional manner, meaning all the back-end integrations take place without needing agent intervention or assistance.

Current products and services[edit]
Jacada WorkSpace, introduced in September 2005, is a product for customer service representatives (CSRs or agents) to provide a single point of access to applications and call center tools required to complete a customer interaction.
Jacada Fusion, introduced in May 2004, is a process optimization platform that automates navigation across, and access to, any style of business system. The firm focuses on the insurance, utilities and telecommunications markets. Typical users of the Jacada Fusion or Jacada WorkSpace products and services are medium to large businesses with more than 100 customer service representatives.

History[edit]
Jacada was founded in 1990 under the company name Client/Server Technology. The original vision of the company was to help organizations leverage and re-use their significant investments in legacy systems.
In 1997 the company introduced its first Java-based web-to-host product branded "Jacada". In 1999, Jacada changed the company name from Client/Server Technology Ltd. to Jacada Ltd. Jacada went public in October 1999, and its shares are traded on Nasdaq under the symbol "JCDA."[2]
In January 2008 Jacada sold its "legacy" business to Software AG for $26 million in cash. [3] This transaction included the intellectual property and related customer contracts associated with the Jacada "legacy" products [Terminal Emulator, Jacada Studio, Jacada Innovator, Jacada Interface Server and Jacada Integrator]. Under the terms of the transaction, Jacada retained the right to develop, market, sell and support Jacada Interface Server and Jacada HostFuse in support of its call center solutions business.[4]

History[edit]
Jacada was founded in 1990 under the company name Client/Server Technology. The original vision of the company was to help organizations leverage and re-use their significant investments in legacy systems.
In 1997 the company introduced its first Java-based web-to-host product branded "Jacada". In 1999, Jacada changed the company name from Client/Server Technology Ltd. to Jacada Ltd. Jacada went public in October 1999, and its shares are traded on Nasdaq under the symbol "JCDA."[2]
In January 2008 Jacada sold its "legacy" business to Software AG for $26 million in cash. [3] This transaction included the intellectual property and related customer contracts associated with the Jacada "legacy" products [Terminal Emulator, Jacada Studio, Jacada Innovator, Jacada Interface Server and Jacada Integrator]. Under the terms of the transaction, Jacada retained the right to develop, market, sell and support Jacada Interface Server and Jacada HostFuse in support of its call center solutions business.[4]
