Repligen Corporation has announced it will acquire filtration-focused Spectrum Pharmaceuticals for approximately $350m (€312m).
 


 
California-US-headquartered Spectrum manufactures products employed for the filtration, isolation, purification and concentration of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, recombinant proteins, diagnostic products and cell therapies.CEO Tony Hunt said the acquisition, which integrates Spectrum’s portfolio of microfiltration and ultrafiltration-focused hollow fibre cartridges, will simplify production of Repligen’s bioprocessing systems.At present, Repligen purchases hollow fibre filters for its upstream bioprocessing system, XCell ATF (alternating tangential flow), from Spectrum and other firms via original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreements.“This transaction addresses one of the biggest gaps in our XCell ATF [alternating tangential flow] product line,” he said.The procurement of these cartridges will improve the Repligen’s filtration business and position in the single-use and continuous manufacturing technologies for bioprocesses market, he added.“I really believe that Repligen needed to strengthen both its chromatography and filtration portfolio. I think this deal really allows us to do that,” said Hunt.Portfolio progressionRepligen, which manufactures resins to purify monoclonal antibodies, will merge Spectrum’s varied therapeutic portfolio in order to increase market presence.  


“The acquisition diversifies Repligen’s markets beyond monoclonal antibody production into vaccine, recombinant protein and gene therapy production,” the company said.Repligen’s CEO told analysts he also plans to cross-sell the firms’ portfolios.“I am very excited by opportunities for us to cross-sell the combined portfolios for expanded commercial organisation,” Hunt said.While Hunt didn’t provide a timeline on new products, he did say that it would take three to six months to get staff from both firms aligned.The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017.Spectrum has 220 employees located in manufacturing sites in North America, a sales and distribution centre in the Netherlands, and commercially across North America, Asia and Europe.

Spectrum Development Opportunity I Financing
Spectrum Development Opportunity I, Llc, Limited Liability Company just filed form D for $55.00 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Spectrum Development Opportunity I was able to sell $45.68 million. That is 83.05 % of the round of financing. The total private financing amount was $55.00 million. The financing form was filed on 2015-11-30. The reason for the financing was: Payments to affiliates for reimbursement of expenses and other fees disclosed in the PPM for the 7 senior living communities. There will be other payments to affiliates but the amounts may not be ascertained at this time.. The fundraising still has about $9.33 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
The company’s business is Other Real Estate. The form D was filed by John M Sevo Issuer’s Manager. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 200 Spruce Street, Suite 200, Denver, Co, Colorado, 80230. John M. Sevo is the related person in the form and it has address: 200 Spruce Street, Suite 200, Denver, Co, Colorado, 80230. Link to Spectrum Development Opportunity I Filing: 000165968715000001.
Analysis of Spectrum Development Opportunity I Offering
On average, companies in the Other Real Estate sector, sell 100.00 % of the total offering size. Spectrum Development Opportunity I sold 83.05 % of the offering. The financing is still open. The average investment floor size for companies in the Other Real Estate industry is $931,000. The total amount raised is 4,806.02 % bigger than the average for companies in the Other Real Estate sector. The minimum investment for this fundraising was set at $0. If you know more about the reasons for the financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Spectrum Development Opportunity I Also
The Form D signed by John M Sevo might help Spectrum Development Opportunity I, Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

Putting It All Together for Maximum Success

The SoilThe PlantMaximizing EnergySystem that Yields





  
 Soil provides a nurturing bed for seedlings and contains a multitude of primary, secondary and trace nutrients necessary for a plant’s optimum health. However, a plant’s genetic performance is limited by the least available nutrient and its ability to uptake nutrients at the right time. Highly productive soils feature a healthy microbial community and result in increased nutritional quality, increased genetic performance, and increased yields.
More
  

 







  
 Plant growth and development depends upon maximizing the effects of photosynthesis. Enrich plant health by planting seeds in productive soils, getting the stand off to a good start, provide the right nutrients when the plant can use it most, and identify potential stresses and ways to minimize those stresses before they hit.  A healthy plant features broad leaves and full kernels/pods.
More
  

 







  
 Energy drives the entire crop production system through chemical, physical and biological processes.  The plant’s ability to harness the sun’s energy, to produce high-quality yields and transfer that energy to the kernel results in increased yields, improved feed quality, and ultimately increases your return on investment.
More
  

 







  
 While achieving improvements to your bottom line and increasing yield are often the key measures for success in farming, we challenge you to think beyond traditional yields. Do you see early crop differentials compared to your neighbors? Have you measured the feed quality of your grain? Are you improving the microbial environment in your soil? The Maximum Farming System is more than yield data, it’s a way of life that improves the well-being of all.

 5 R's of Nutrient Stewardship 
 Systems Approach Delivers the Breadth and Depth of Farming Responsibly
Farmers are, without doubt, a critically important resource needed to feed a rapidly growing global population. However, those same producers face a challenging paradox: balancing environmental concerns while maintaining soil productivity and still earning an income.
As advocates for sustainable farming practices, growers attempt to minimize agricultural run-off, reduce nutrient loss in fields, and maximize nutrient uptake. Farmers with tightened budgets are beginning to reexamine their approach to soil... 
  
   

  
 Soil: The Secret to Success 
 5th Generation Indiana Farm Family Make Soil Priority

The 5th generation farm has advanced agriculture by pioneering innovative conservation practices. The Fox family has used the Maximum Farming System for six years and recognizes that success starts with understanding the soil.
The farm was originally established by Fox’s great grandfather after he returned from the Civil War more than 150 years ago. Throughout the years...

 Determined Farmer Saves Farm with Help of the Maximum Farming System
When Chris Pettz harvested the last of his crops in the fall of 2005, he wasn’t sure what the future would hold.
“Five years after converting from flood irrigation to center pivot irrigation, I was seeing some yield loss. Our yields were actually declining with the new irrigation system, and herbicides and insecticides weren’t working anymore either. Everything was gradually declining,” Pettz said.
Pettz farms for non-profit landowner, Garden City Company, and the majority of his fields are located...

 Potassium Nutrition 
 A Controversy that has Cost Farmers Countless Dollars
American farmers have spent nearly $34 billion on Potassium since 19801. Has this investment actually contributed to an increase in yield or crop quality? Not according to a recent peer reviewed research study authored by S.A. Kahn, R.L. Mulvaney and T.R. Ellsworth that found that after a survey of more than 2,100 yield response trials it was confirmed that Potassium Chloride (KCl) fertilization is unlikely to increase crop yield. Contrary to the instilled perception of KCl as a valuable commodity, more than 1,400 field trials...

 Research Continues to Prove Effectiveness of the Maximum Farming System
The art of foliar feeding production crops is a hot agricultural topic that is gaining ground and publicity. An increasing number of farmers are using the practice to fine-tune their nutrient strategies to create a better crop stand and maximize yields.
A leading industry expert in foliar nutrition, Dr. Patrick Brown and his team of researchers from the University of California, Davis have been in collaboration with Ag Spectrum to conduct research that furthers the understanding of foliar feeding in the...

In December 1998, SRG purchased a treating and processing plant from Shell/Tejas, which significantly increased long-lived dedicated volumes to the SRG system. In 1999, SRG made its largest acquisition, acquiring four treating and processing plants, compressor stations and associated pipe from Dynegy, which allowed it to consolidate its treating and processing into its state-of-the-art plants, thereby enhancing system efficiencies.  In 2001, SRG further expanded its system and increased dedicated volumes to its system by acquiring a treating and processing plant from an East Texas producer. In March 2002, SRG sold substantially all of its assets to Enbridge.
