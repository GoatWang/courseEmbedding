(Nasdaq:CORI), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty transdermal products, today announced that Joseph J. Sarret, M.D., J.D. has joined the Company in the newly created position of Chief Business Officer. Reporting to Corium's President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter D. Staple, Dr. Sarret will serve as a member of the company's executive leadership team with responsibility for developing and implementing Corium's business strategies, building new alliances and expanding existing ones, and pursuing new business initiatives that leverage Corium's advanced transdermal technologies and product candidates.   

	"Joe is joining Corium at an important phase in the Company's growth, as we advance our portfolio of proprietary and partnered development programs," said Mr. Staple. "With his extensive experience in establishing high-value partnering relationships, Joe will be assuming responsibility for business initiatives that leverage our capabilities and product assets, and will contribute broadly to our future as a leader in developing first-in-patch products that can improve health outcomes and quality of life for patients."

	"This is an exciting time to join Corium, as I have the opportunity to work with an accomplished team in taking the company to the next level based on proven technology platforms, a track record in transdermal innovation, and proprietary pipeline assets," said Dr. Sarret. "I am looking forward to helping Corium realize the potential of its technologies across small molecules, biologics and vaccines and in pursuing new business opportunities for the company's proprietary programs." 

	Most recently, Dr. Sarret served as Senior Vice President, Strategic Accounts at Solazyme, Inc., a publicly traded company focused on developing renewable products for a variety of industries, and as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Sevident, Inc., a start-up biotechnology company developing medical diagnostics and life science research products.  Prior to joining Solazyme, Dr. Sarret held positions of increasing responsibility from 2005 to 2012 at Codexis, Inc., a publicly traded international industrial biotechnology company, including Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, and President, Pharmaceutical Services and Enzyme Products.  At Codexis, he was responsible for numerous strategic partnerships in the pharmaceutical and bioindustrial sectors, including multi-product development and supply agreements, acquisitions, and licensing transactions. In addition, Dr. Sarret had P&L responsibility for the company's global pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing business unit, which had annual sales of approximately $50 million. Previously, he practiced corporate and transactional law at Latham & Watkins LLP.  Dr. Sarret also served as Attending Physician and Acting Medical Director for the HIV Clinic at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.  Dr. Sarret holds a B.A. in Human Biology from Stanford University, an M.D. from the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and a J.D. from Stanford Law School, and is a member of the Phi Beta Kappa, Alpha Omega Alpha and Order of the Coif honor societies.
