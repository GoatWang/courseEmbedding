Testimonial Rating










See Quote

Our business is quite complex as we span upstream, midstream, and downstream operations—each of which has its own unique requirements. JD Edwards EnterpriseOne offers the industry’s most robust software package for energy enterprises and provided the adaptability we require. We also determined that we could implement it faster, deploy it at a lower cost, and maintain it more cost-effectively than an SAP system.
