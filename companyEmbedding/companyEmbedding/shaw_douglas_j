I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

The text has also long been recognized for its careful, thorough explanations and its presentation of mathematics in an informal yet mathematically precise manner. The graphing approach is supported by realistic applications, including many using real data and numerous new ones. Thomas W. Hungerford and new coauthor Douglas J. Shaw also include a greater emphasis than many texts on the why? of mathematics--which is addressed in both the exposition and in the exercise sets by focusing on algebraic, graphical, and numerical perspectives.Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.   Preview this book » What people are saying - Write a reviewWe haven't found any reviews in the usual places.Selected pagesTitle PageTable of ContentsIndexContentsBASICS1 GRAPHS AND TECHNOLOGY77 FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS141 POLYNOMIAL AND RATIONAL FUNCTIONS239 EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS341 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS427 TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES AND EQUATIONS513 TRIANGLE TRIGONOMETRY573 SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS771 DISCRETE ALGEBRA825 LIMITS AND CONTINUITY879 Algebra Review931 Geometry Review953 Programs964 Answers967 Index of Applications1059 MoreAPPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY625 ANALYTIC GEOMETRY669 Subject Index1062 Copyright LessOther editions - View allContemporary Precalculus: A Graphing ApproachThomas W.

E-mail: advocate@douglasjshaw@gmail.com Cell phone: 0741462015 Office phone: 0741462015 Fax: 0866282665 Areas of Expertise: National Credit Act and Debt Counselling law; liquidation and the Insolvency Act and sometimes the Deeds Registries Act 






Douglas J Shaw, originally from Scotland having moved to South Africa in 2000, has four degrees, wide experience and in his spare time applies his mind to writing and thinking about how to reduce crime, poverty, traffic and environmental degradation. He is a former Chairman of Mensa Johannesburg during which the organisation gained more new members than any previous chairman’s tenure, and he has written around twenty books and has a series of law videos on YouTube.
As an advocate involved in a range of court work, he regularly frequents the High Court in some capacity in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Pretoria where a large percentage of his work focuses on defending clients against banks and other credit providers. As a result he is well versed in the National Credit Act and Debt Counselling law; liquidation and the Insolvency Act as well as the Deeds Registries Act.
As a result of his previous involvement in investment banking, where he worked as a fund manager (running the best performing investment fund in the world in 2000/2001), he is familiar with securitisation and other aspects of  this field. This ensures he is well versed in Summary Judgement, Default Judgments, Amendments, Discovery, Rule 30 and many other technicalities of the rules of Court, while he is also particularly good when high numerical analysis skills are needed.
Apart from the above, Douglas has also done work on contracts, delict, pension fund legislation, divorce and high value maintenance matters. While he is also currently taking a case to the Constitutional Court which has thus involved all the technicalities around the Section 36 balancing law and the certification process.
Douglas also represents organisations and companies in the consultation processes with government in the creation of new Acts and policies. For example, he represented the South African Property Owners Association in the NEDLAC process with government and unions, significantly improving the draft act through that process.
He also does a lot of Memoranda of Incorporation and teaches Corporate Law which at times ensures he gets involved in disputes between share holders and directors, where his experience of management consultancy on the mines ensures he is familiar with the problems of running corporations.
