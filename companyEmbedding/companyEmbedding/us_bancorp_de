The U.S. Bank name first appeared as United States National Bank of Portland, established in Portland, Oregon, in 1891.[4] It changed its name to the United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964.[4] In 1902, it merged with Ainsworth National Bank of Portland, but kept the U.S. National Bank name.[4] The decision turned out to be advantageous for the bank, as a 1913 federal law prohibited other banks from using “United States” in their names from that time forward.[citation needed] U.S. National was among the first banks to form a bank holding company — called U.S. Bancorp, on September 9, 1968.[citation needed]
The central part of the franchise dates from 1864, with the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis.[4] In 1929, that bank merged with First National Bank of St. Paul (also formed in 1864) and several smaller Upper Midwest banks to form the First Bank Stock Corporation, which changed its name to First Bank System in 1968.[4]
In the eastern part of the franchise, Farmers and Millers Bank in Milwaukee opened its doors in 1853, growing into the First National Bank of Milwaukee and eventually becoming First Wisconsin and ultimately Firstar Corporation.[4] In Cincinnati, First National Bank of Cincinnati opened for business in 1863 under National Charter #24—the charter that U.S. Bancorp still operates under today, and one of the oldest active national bank charters in the nation.[4] Despite having started up in the midst of the Civil War, First National Bank of Cincinnati went on to survive many decades to grow into Star Bank.[4]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon era[edit]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon officially became a banking holding company for the U.S. National Bank of Oregon in January 1969[5] after receiving authorization from its bank directors on September 9, 1968[6] and subsequently receiving legal approval to proceed from the Comptroller of the Currency on November 28, 1968.[7] LeRoy B. Staver, president and chief executive officer of the bank, was quickly appointed chairman and chief executive officer for the new holding company while Robert B. Wilson was appointed president of the holding company and also executive vice president for the bank.[8] Wilson later resign as president in December 1972[9] and his position was filled eight months later by John A. Elornaga.[10]
After a long period of service, Staver finally retired in October 1974 and was succeeded by John Elorriaga who was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer while Carl May was named president in Elorriaga's place.[11]
A major change in the organization of leadership in U.S. Bancorp of Oregon occurred in August 1983. Although Elorriaga remained as chairman and chief executive officer for the firm, May was appointed to the new position of executive assistant to the chairman while Edmund P. Jensen was appointed president as replacement to May, and Roger L. Breezley was appointed to the new post of chief operating officer.[12]
In December 1986, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Forest Grove, Oregon-based Valley National Corporation (not to be confused with Phoenix, Arizona-based company of the same name) with its five-branch Valley National Bank of Forest Grove subsidiary for $13.7 million in stock.[13]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon made its first acquisition outside the state of Oregon by announcing in December 1986 the pending acquisition of the Spokane, Washington-based Old National Bancorp with its Old National Bank of Washington and First National Bank of Spokane subsidiaries for $174 million.[14][15] The acquisition was completed in July 1987 on the first day that the state of Washington had allowed bank acquisitions by out-of-state companies.[16]

John Elorriaga retired as chairman of the board and chief executive officer in November 1987 and was replaced by Roger L. Breezley while Jensen continues as president.[22][23]
In December 1987, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Bellingham, Washington-based Mt Baker Bank for $25 million.[24]

In October 1989, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Mother Lode Savings Bank with three branch offices for $5.3 million.[30] The acquisition was completed in August 1990.[31] This acquisition was one of the first of a thrift by a commercial bank in the nation since legislation permitting such takeovers went into effect.
During the late 1980s, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon made several attempts to enter the state of Idaho by the acquisition of an existing Idaho-based bank, the only method then allowed under Idaho law, but failed when the price got too high.[32] In March 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they would established a bank through a loophole in Federal banking law that allow the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to allow the relocation of bank headquarters within 30 miles of their present location without regards to state boundaries and state regulations.[33] So U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they plan to transfer the existing branches of the First National Bank of Spokane to the U.S. Bancorp of Washington and then ask permission from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to move the headquarters of First National from Spokane, Washington, to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. After receiving Federal approval, First National was finally moved in February 1992 and renamed U.S. Bank of Idaho.[34]
In July 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Auburn, California-based HeartFed Financial Corporation with its Heart Federal Savings and Loan subsidiary for $107.8 million in stock.[35] At the time of the announcement, Heart Federal Savings had 29 branch offices in northern California. The acquisition was completed in March 1991 for $118 million.[36]

In February 1992, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the 20 branch offices in Northern California and 29 branch offices in Nevada for $70 million that were being divested by Bankamerica Corporation as a result of Bank of America's impending acquisition of Security Pacific Corporation.[38][39][40] This acquisition gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first presence in the state of Nevada.
Another major change in the organization of leadership in U.S. Bancorp of Oregon occurred in January 1993. While retaining his position as chief operating officer, Edmund P. Jensen was appointed vice chairman while giving his position of president to Kevin R. Kelly. At the same time, Gerry B. Cameron was appointed vice chairman.[41] Ten months later, Jensen resigned to become president of Visa International.[42] In January 1994, Gerry Cameron was first appointed chief operating officer as a replacement to Jensen[43] and later appointed chief executive officer just three weeks later.[44] Kelly submitted his resignation as president in March 1994[45] and Breezley finally gave up the chairmanship to Cameron in April 1994.[46][47]
In May 1995, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Boise, Idaho-based West One Bancorp for $1.8 billion.[48][49] At the time of the announcement, West One had branch offices in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Utah while U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had branch offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada. The acquisition was completed in December 1995 and gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first entry into the state of Utah.[50] As part of the acquisition deal, West One's chairman and chief executive Daniel R. Nelson would become the chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp and he would later be Cameron's successor as chairman and CEO upon Cameron's planned retirement in three years. Since both U.S. Bancorp and West One had overlapping territories in Oregon and Washington, the U.S. Justice Department would only allow the acquisition to proceed if U.S. Bancorp would sell off 27 branch offices in Washington and Oregon.[51] As a result of the regulatory ruling, U.S. Bancorp sold 25 branch offices in Oregon, four in central Washington and one in Idaho to First Hawaiian Bank for $38 million in cash.[52][53]
In February 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the San Ramon, California-based California Bancshares for $309 million in stock.[54] California Bancshares had a total of 38 branches in the East San Francisco Bay Area in nine separate banks that included Alameda First National, Community First National, Modesto Banking Co., Commercial Bank of Fremont, Lamorinda National Bank, Bank of San Ramon Valley, Westside Bank, Concord Commercial Bank and Bank of Milipitas. The acquisition was completed in June 1996.[55]
In September 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the St. George, Utah-based Sun Capital Bancorp with its three-branch office Sun Capital Bank subsidiary for $15.5 million.[56] The acquisition was completed in January 1997.[57]
In December 1996, Daniel R. Nelson, president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, unexpectedly announced his early retirement effective on New Year’s Day 1997. Nelson was originally in line to be Gerry B. Cameron's successor as chairman and chief executive upon the Cameron's planned retirement on New Year's Day 1999.[58]
In December 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Business & Professional Bank for $35 million in cash.[59] The acquisition was completed in May 1997.[60]

In March 1997, the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based First Bank System announced the pending acquisition of the Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp of Oregon for $9 billion in stock.[61][62][63] At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had banking offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Utah while First Bank System had banking offices in Minnesota, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. Under the terms of the acquisition, First Bank System would be renamed U.S. Bancorp with the headquarters for the newly combined company being at First Bank's existing headquarters in Minneapolis. John F. Grundhofer, chairman and chief executive of First Bank, was appointed president and chief executive of the new company while Gerry B. Cameron, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, was appointed chairman of the new company, which he held until his retirement in 1998. The acquisition was completed in August 1997.[64] Approximately 4000 jobs were eliminated, mostly in Portland.[65]

The acquisition was completed in December 1997.[67]
In March 1998, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Vancouver, Washington-based Northwest Bancshares with its 10-branch offices Northwest National Bank subsidiary for an undisclosed amount.[68][69] In October 1998, the U.S. Justice Department agreed to allow the acquisition to proceed on the condition that one of the Northwest National Bank branch offices was to be sold.[70] The acquisition was completed in December 1998 after U.S. Bancorp sold the request banking office to Centennial Bank of Eugene.[71]
At the end of 1998, Gerry Cameron retired as chairman and handed the position over to John Grundhofer who added the title of chairman to his other positions of president and chief executive officer.[72][73]
In February 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Bank of Commerce with its 10 branch offices for $314 million in stock.[74][75][76] The acquisition was finalized in July 1999.[77]

The acquisition was finalized in November 1999 for $1.04 billion in stock.[80][81]
In July 1999, Philip G. Heasley was appointed president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp. John Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Heasley while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer.[82][83] Heasley had assisted Grundhofer in turning the company around from near insolvency when the company was originally known as First Bank until it became a successful financial institution that became large enough to be absorb other banks, including U.S. Bancorp of Oregon in 1997. Heasley resigned the following year to join Bank One as the head of their First USA credit card unit[84] around the same time Firstar was about to takeover U.S. Bancorp.
In September 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Peninsula Bank with its 11 branch offices for $104 million in stock.[85][86][87][88] In early January 2000, a group of Peninsula Bank stockholders tried to stop the merger because the initial merger agreement was made prior to the huge 27% single-day drop in the value of U.S. Bancorp stock which effectively lowered the purchase price.[89] The acquisition was later completed in January 2000 at a 10% reduction of the original price negotiated.[90]
In June 2000, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Scripps Financial Corporation with its nine-branch office Scripps Bank subsidiary for $155 million in stock.[91] The acquisition was completed in October 2000.[92]

To allow the merger to proceed, the U.S. Department of Justice required Firstar to sell 11 branch offices in the Minneapolis-area and 2 in Council Bluffs, Iowa.[98] Bremer Bank of Saint Paul, Minnesota purchased the 11 Minneapolis-area Firstar offices[99][100] while Liberty Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa purchased the 2 Council Bluffs offices.[101][102]
Brief history of Firstar prior to acquisition[edit]
Main article: Firstar Corporation
Although the origin of the Milwaukee-based Firstar Corporation can be traced back to the founding of the Farmer's and Millers Bank in Milwaukee in 1853 and the later formation of the First Wisconsin National Bank in 1919, the actual company that took over U.S. Bancorp in 2001 is the actually the same company and leadership that was responsible for the takeover of Firstar 27 months earlier in 1988, namely Star Banc Corporation. Jerry Grundhofer and his team from Star Banc were instrumental in both acquisitions. The stock and company histories for the current U.S. Bancorp is derive from that for the First National Cincinnati Corporation, a predecessor of Star Banc Corporation, and the First National Bank of Cincinnati that was founded in 1863.

U.S. Bancorp, with $18.6 billion in assets, is the country's 35th biggest bank. Breezley's goal is to get it among the top 20 banks by 1994. Even if the bigger banks were to stop growing, U.S. Bancorp would have to expand by 70 percent over the next 3 1/2 years to achieve the goal. But that may not be as difficult as it sounds. The company has tripled in size since 1983... Started from scratch 2 1/2 years ago, the company's U.S. Bank of California unit, with about $1.4 billion in assets, already is the seventh-largest bank headquartered in Northern California. Forming U.S. Bank of California after buying the tiny Bank of Loleta in Eureka at the end of 1988, Breezley added Sacramento's Mother Lode Savings in 1990 and Auburn's HeartFed Financial Corp. and Petaluma's Northbay Financial this year... Much of U.S. Bancorp's growth has occurred in the state of Washington, where the company has made six acquisitions in four years and where U.S. Bank of Washington, with $5.4 billion in assets, is now the third-largest bank. Breezley's next target is Idaho, where his blend of caution and aggression is evident. Tejera said that last year U.S. Bancorp tried three times to buy Idaho institutions: First National Bank of North Idaho in Wallace, Mountain West Savings Bank of Coeur d'Alene and Boise-based West One Bancorp. "They played it very conservative in those attempts, walking away when the price got too steep," he said.

First Bank assumed the U.S. Bancorp name when the deal closed in March. Cameron became chairman of the merged company. The move is not a surprise. Cameron had said he would retire when the First Bank-U.S. Bancorp merger was announced in March 1997. 
^ DePass, Dee (December 29, 1998). "Grundhofer gains title as U.S. Bancorp chair retires - Cameron steps down after 40-year career". Minneapolis Star-Tribune. p. 01D. (Subscription required (help)). U.S. Bancorp Chairman Gerry Cameron will retire effective Thursday, ending a banking career that spanned four decades. Cameron in 1997 had announced his intention to retire by the end of this year, so the move is no surprise. But it does further cement the passing of control at the old U.S. Bancorp, where Cameron was the CEO and president before the August 1997 sale of the Portland-based bank to Minneapolis-based First Bank System. After the deal closed, First Bank took the U.S. Bancorp name. Cameron's departure gives John (Jack) Grundhofer the title of chairman in addition to chief executive and president. Cameron remained out West after the acquisition, which caused many analysts to believe he had effectively given up control of the company long before his official Dec. 31 retirement.

It wasn't the mega merger some bank analysts expected, but U.S. Bancorp pulled its own coup Thursday in announcing that it will buy San Diego-based Bank of Commerce in a stock deal valued near $314 million. Pending regulatory and shareholder approval, the purchase should close by June. Bank of Commerce, with 10 branches, boasts $638 million in assets and is the largest Small Business Administration (SBA) lender in California and one of the largest in the nation.

Industry speculation immediately centered on talk that the 49-year-old Heasley, a former Citibanker and USB's chief technology architect, had been selected over Zona, 54, a 10-year veteran who has run middle market and commercial operations, for the No. 2 position... The three men formed the management trio that transformed the small First Bank, near insolvency a decade ago, into U.S. Bancorp, the 13th-largest bank in the nation with $77 billion in assets.

^ Bigelow, Bruce V. (January 7, 2000). "Peninsula Bank shareholders move to block merger". San Diego Union Tribune. pp. C–1. (Subscription required (help)). A group of shareholders in Peninsula Bank of San Diego has moved to thwart Peninsula's merger with U.S. Bancorp, arguing the $100 million deal was "materially altered" when U.S. Bancorp cut its earnings estimate... Peninsula said last September that the bank had agreed to a buyout proposal submitted by Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the nation's No. 12 bank. The deal was valued then at approximately $100 million to $120 million. But the lawsuit is focused on a subsequent announcement issued Dec. 6, when U.S. Bancorp said lower-than-expected revenue and increased investments had reduced earnings expectations for the fourth quarter and the rest of 2000. The news sent shares of U.S. Bancorp plummeting by more than 27 percent that day, erasing more than $7 billion of market value. Before U.S. Bancorp's disclosure, the Minnesota bank had an estimated 12 percent rate in its earnings growth. The actual rate is now closer to 5 percent, Robbins said.

Firstar Corp. completes its $22 billion acquisition of U.S. Bancorp today, creating the nation's eighth-largest bank and triggering a move by a number of Firstar executives from Milwaukee to Minnesota. The influx of more than a dozen top Firstar personnel is expected to take place over the next few months. The headquarters of the combined bank will be in Minneapolis and the combined firm will keep the U.S. Bancorp name. Firstar CEO Jerry Grundhofer becomes CEO of the new, $160 billion U.S. Bancorp. Grundhofer, who replaces his older brother, Jack, in the role of USB CEO, reportedly already has located property in the Twin Cities and expects to move here by the fall. Jack Grundhofer becomes chairman of the combined organization. He will retire next year... The bank will be based in Minneapolis, retain the U.S. Bancorp name and span 24 states with nearly 2,200 branches. The bank will have $107 billion in deposits and 51,000 employees. (Firstar had 23,000, USB 28,000.) The combined bank plans to cut $266 million in expenses over three years, but few layoffs are planned because there was little geographic overlap between the banks. The New CEO will be former Firstar CEO Jerry Grundhofer. Former USB CEO John Grundhofer will be the chairman and retire in 2002.

U.S. Bancorp is a bank holding company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is the parent company of U.S. Bank, National Association, known as U.S. Bank, which is ranked 7th on the list of largest banks in the United States. The company provides banking, investment, mortgage, trust, and payment services products to individuals, businesses, governmental entities, and other financial institutions. It has 3,106 branches and 4,842 ATMs, primarily in the Midwestern United States.[1] The company also owns Elavon, a processor of credit card transactions.[1]
U.S. Bancorp operates under the second-oldest continuous national charter, originally Charter #24, granted in 1863 following the passage of the National Bank Act. Earlier charters have expired as banks were closed or acquired, raising U.S. Bank's charter number from #24 to #2. The oldest national charter, originally granted to the First National Bank of Philadelphia, is held by Wells Fargo, which it obtained upon its merger with Wachovia.[3]

The U.S. Bank name first appeared as United States National Bank of Portland, established in Portland, Oregon, in 1891.[4] It changed its name to the United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964.[4] In 1902, it merged with Ainsworth National Bank of Portland, but kept the U.S. National Bank name.[4] The decision turned out to be advantageous for the bank, as a 1913 federal law prohibited other banks from using “United States” in their names from that time forward.[citation needed] U.S. National was among the first banks to form a bank holding company — called U.S. Bancorp, on September 9, 1968.[citation needed]
The central part of the franchise dates from 1864, with the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis.[4] In 1929, that bank merged with First National Bank of St. Paul (also formed in 1864) and several smaller Upper Midwest banks to form the First Bank Stock Corporation, which changed its name to First Bank System in 1968.[4]
In the eastern part of the franchise, Farmers and Millers Bank in Milwaukee opened its doors in 1853, growing into the First National Bank of Milwaukee and eventually becoming First Wisconsin and ultimately Firstar Corporation.[4] In Cincinnati, First National Bank of Cincinnati opened for business in 1863 under National Charter #24—the charter that U.S. Bancorp still operates under today, and one of the oldest active national bank charters in the nation.[4] Despite having started up in the midst of the Civil War, First National Bank of Cincinnati went on to survive many decades to grow into Star Bank.[4]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon era[edit]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon officially became a banking holding company for the U.S. National Bank of Oregon in January 1969[5] after receiving authorization from its bank directors on September 9, 1968[6] and subsequently receiving legal approval to proceed from the Comptroller of the Currency on November 28, 1968.[7] LeRoy B. Staver, president and chief executive officer of the bank, was quickly appointed chairman and chief executive officer for the new holding company while Robert B. Wilson was appointed president of the holding company and also executive vice president for the bank.[8] Wilson later resign as president in December 1972[9] and his position was filled eight months later by John A. Elornaga.[10]

Nelson would become the chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp and he would later be Cameron's successor as chairman and CEO upon Cameron's planned retirement in three years. Since both U.S. Bancorp and West One had overlapping territories in Oregon and Washington, the U.S. Justice Department would only allow the acquisition to proceed if U.S. Bancorp would sell off 27 branch offices in Washington and Oregon.[51] As a result of the regulatory ruling, U.S. Bancorp sold 25 branch offices in Oregon, four in central Washington and one in Idaho to First Hawaiian Bank for $38 million in cash.[52][53]
In February 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the San Ramon, California-based California Bancshares for $309 million in stock.[54] California Bancshares had a total of 38 branches in the East San Francisco Bay Area in nine separate banks that included Alameda First National, Community First National, Modesto Banking Co., Commercial Bank of Fremont, Lamorinda National Bank, Bank of San Ramon Valley, Westside Bank, Concord Commercial Bank and Bank of Milipitas.

In June 2000, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Scripps Financial Corporation with its nine-branch office Scripps Bank subsidiary for $155 million in stock.[91] The acquisition was completed in October 2000.[92]

To allow the merger to proceed, the U.S. Department of Justice required Firstar to sell 11 branch offices in the Minneapolis-area and 2 in Council Bluffs, Iowa.[98] Bremer Bank of Saint Paul, Minnesota purchased the 11 Minneapolis-area Firstar offices[99][100] while Liberty Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa purchased the 2 Council Bluffs offices.[101][102]
Brief history of Firstar prior to acquisition[edit]
Main article: Firstar Corporation
Although the origin of the Milwaukee-based Firstar Corporation can be traced back to the founding of the Farmer's and Millers Bank in Milwaukee in 1853 and the later formation of the First Wisconsin National Bank in 1919, the actual company that took over U.S. Bancorp in 2001 is the actually the same company and leadership that was responsible for the takeover of Firstar 27 months earlier in 1988, namely Star Banc Corporation. Jerry Grundhofer and his team from Star Banc were instrumental in both acquisitions. The stock and company histories for the current U.S. Bancorp is derive from that for the First National Cincinnati Corporation, a predecessor of Star Banc Corporation, and the First National Bank of Cincinnati that was founded in 1863.

U.S. Bancorp continued its expansion into Northern California by announcing Wednesday that it has agreed to acquire Mother Lode Savings Bank of Sacramento for about $5.3 million. Mother Lode, which has assets of $107.7 million and three offices, was founded by women in 1980 as a savings and loan to encourage business development by women in the area. It was later changed to a savings bank and expanded its operations... It is one of the first acquisitions of a thrift by a commercial bank in the nation since legislation permitting such takeovers. However, the savings bank is healthy and it was not a rescue effort, U.S. Bancorp said... When the transaction is completed, expected early next year, the bank will become part of U.S. Bank of California, a Bancorp subsidiary. The California unit was formed early last year with the acquisition of the $143 million-in-assets Bank of Loleta in Eureka, Calif.

^ Howe, Kenneth (July 29, 1991). "U.S. Bancorp on Northern California Buying Spree". San Francisco Chronicle. p. B1. (Subscription required (help)). U.S. Bancorp, with $18.6 billion in assets, is the country's 35th biggest bank. Breezley's goal is to get it among the top 20 banks by 1994. Even if the bigger banks were to stop growing, U.S. Bancorp would have to expand by 70 percent over the next 3 1/2 years to achieve the goal. But that may not be as difficult as it sounds. The company has tripled in size since 1983... Started from scratch 2 1/2 years ago, the company's U.S. Bank of California unit, with about $1.4 billion in assets, already is the seventh-largest bank headquartered in Northern California. Forming U.S. Bank of California after buying the tiny Bank of Loleta in Eureka at the end of 1988, Breezley added Sacramento's Mother Lode Savings in 1990 and Auburn's HeartFed Financial Corp. and Petaluma's Northbay Financial this year... Much of U.S. Bancorp's growth has occurred in the state of Washington, where the company has made six acquisitions in four years and where U.S. Bank of Washington, with $5.4 billion in assets, is now the third-largest bank. Breezley's next target is Idaho, where his blend of caution and aggression is evident. Tejera said that last year U.S. Bancorp tried three times to buy Idaho institutions: First National Bank of North Idaho in Wallace, Mountain West Savings Bank of Coeur d'Alene and Boise-based West One Bancorp. "They played it very conservative in those attempts, walking away when the price got too steep," he said.

A group of shareholders in Peninsula Bank of San Diego has moved to thwart Peninsula's merger with U.S. Bancorp, arguing the $100 million deal was "materially altered" when U.S. Bancorp cut its earnings estimate... Peninsula said last September that the bank had agreed to a buyout proposal submitted by Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the nation's No. 12 bank. The deal was valued then at approximately $100 million to $120 million. But the lawsuit is focused on a subsequent announcement issued Dec. 6, when U.S. Bancorp said lower-than-expected revenue and increased investments had reduced earnings expectations for the fourth quarter and the rest of 2000. The news sent shares of U.S. Bancorp plummeting by more than 27 percent that day, erasing more than $7 billion of market value. Before U.S. Bancorp's disclosure, the Minnesota bank had an estimated 12 percent rate in its earnings growth. The actual rate is now closer to 5 percent, Robbins said. 
^ "Business Briefing: U.S. Bancorp completes acquisition". San Diego Union Tribune. January 19, 2000. pp. C–2. (Subscription required (help)). U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis said yesterday it completed its acquisition of Peninsula Bank of San Diego. Based on the closing price of U.S. Bancorp shares Friday, Peninsula holders received $35.70 in U.S. Bancorp's shares for each Peninsula share held. Peninsula plans to convert its operations into U.S. Bank's systems, products and services in July.

Firstar Corp. completes its $22 billion acquisition of U.S. Bancorp today, creating the nation's eighth-largest bank and triggering a move by a number of Firstar executives from Milwaukee to Minnesota. The influx of more than a dozen top Firstar personnel is expected to take place over the next few months. The headquarters of the combined bank will be in Minneapolis and the combined firm will keep the U.S. Bancorp name. Firstar CEO Jerry Grundhofer becomes CEO of the new, $160 billion U.S. Bancorp. Grundhofer, who replaces his older brother, Jack, in the role of USB CEO, reportedly already has located property in the Twin Cities and expects to move here by the fall. Jack Grundhofer becomes chairman of the combined organization. He will retire next year... The bank will be based in Minneapolis, retain the U.S. Bancorp name and span 24 states with nearly 2,200 branches. The bank will have $107 billion in deposits and 51,000 employees. (Firstar had 23,000, USB 28,000.) The combined bank plans to cut $266 million in expenses over three years, but few layoffs are planned because there was little geographic overlap between the banks. The New CEO will be former Firstar CEO Jerry Grundhofer. Former USB CEO John Grundhofer will be the chairman and retire in 2002.

U.S. Bancorp is a bank holding company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is the parent company of U.S. Bank, National Association, known as U.S. Bank, which is ranked 7th on the list of largest banks in the United States.

Earlier charters have expired as banks were closed or acquired, raising U.S. Bank's charter number from #24 to #2. The oldest national charter, originally granted to the First National Bank of Philadelphia, is held by Wells Fargo, which it obtained upon its merger with Wachovia.[3]

The U.S. Bank name first appeared as United States National Bank of Portland, established in Portland, Oregon, in 1891.[4] It changed its name to the United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964.[4] In 1902, it merged with Ainsworth National Bank of Portland, but kept the U.S. National Bank name.[4] The decision turned out to be advantageous for the bank, as a 1913 federal law prohibited other banks from using “United States” in their names from that time forward.[citation needed] U.S. National was among the first banks to form a bank holding company — called U.S. Bancorp, on September 9, 1968.[citation needed]
The central part of the franchise dates from 1864, with the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis.[4] In 1929, that bank merged with First National Bank of St. Paul (also formed in 1864) and several smaller Upper Midwest banks to form the First Bank Stock Corporation, which changed its name to First Bank System in 1968.[4]
In the eastern part of the franchise, Farmers and Millers Bank in Milwaukee opened its doors in 1853, growing into the First National Bank of Milwaukee and eventually becoming First Wisconsin and ultimately Firstar Corporation.[4] In Cincinnati, First National Bank of Cincinnati opened for business in 1863 under National Charter #24—the charter that U.S. Bancorp still operates under today, and one of the oldest active national bank charters in the nation.[4] Despite having started up in the midst of the Civil War, First National Bank of Cincinnati went on to survive many decades to grow into Star Bank.[4]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon era[edit]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon officially became a banking holding company for the U.S. National Bank of Oregon in January 1969[5] after receiving authorization from its bank directors on September 9, 1968[6] and subsequently receiving legal approval to proceed from the Comptroller of the Currency on November 28, 1968.[7] LeRoy B. Staver, president and chief executive officer of the bank, was quickly appointed chairman and chief executive officer for the new holding company while Robert B. Wilson was appointed president of the holding company and also executive vice president for the bank.[8] Wilson later resign as president in December 1972[9] and his position was filled eight months later by John A. Elornaga.[10]
After a long period of service, Staver finally retired in October 1974 and was succeeded by John Elorriaga who was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer while Carl May was named president in Elorriaga's place.[11]
A major change in the organization of leadership in U.S. Bancorp of Oregon occurred in August 1983. Although Elorriaga remained as chairman and chief executive officer for the firm, May was appointed to the new position of executive assistant to the chairman while Edmund P. Jensen was appointed president as replacement to May, and Roger L. Breezley was appointed to the new post of chief operating officer.[12]
In December 1986, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Forest Grove, Oregon-based Valley National Corporation (not to be confused with Phoenix, Arizona-based company of the same name) with its five-branch Valley National Bank of Forest Grove subsidiary for $13.7 million in stock.[13]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon made its first acquisition outside the state of Oregon by announcing in December 1986 the pending acquisition of the Spokane, Washington-based Old National Bancorp with its Old National Bank of Washington and First National Bank of Spokane subsidiaries for $174 million.[14][15] The acquisition was completed in July 1987 on the first day that the state of Washington had allowed bank acquisitions by out-of-state companies.[16]
In December 1986, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Camas, Washington-based Heritage Bank for $2.8 million.[17][18]
In May 1987, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Seattle, Washington-based Peoples Bancorp with its Peoples National Bank subsidiary for $275 million in stock.[19][20] The acquisition was completed in December 1987.[21] After the acquisition, Peoples and Old National were combined to form U.S. Bank of Washington.
John Elorriaga retired as chairman of the board and chief executive officer in November 1987 and was replaced by Roger L. Breezley while Jensen continues as president.[22][23]
In December 1987, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Bellingham, Washington-based Mt Baker Bank for $25 million.[24]
U.S. Bancorp of Oregon entered the state of California by announcing in April 1988 the pending acquisition of the Eureka, California-based Bank of Loleta with seven branch offices in Humboldt and Del Norte counties for $15.3 million in cash.[25] The acquisition was completed in December 1988 and was renamed U.S. Bank of California.[26]
In April 1988, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Bellingham, Washington-based Northwestern Commercial Bank for $15.5 million.[27] The acquisition was completed in November 1988.[28]
In July 1988, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Auburn, Washington-based Western Independent Bancshares with its Auburn Valley Bank subsidiary for $4.25 million in cash.[29]
In October 1989, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Mother Lode Savings Bank with three branch offices for $5.3 million.[30] The acquisition was completed in August 1990.[31] This acquisition was one of the first of a thrift by a commercial bank in the nation since legislation permitting such takeovers went into effect.
During the late 1980s, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon made several attempts to enter the state of Idaho by the acquisition of an existing Idaho-based bank, the only method then allowed under Idaho law, but failed when the price got too high.[32] In March 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they would established a bank through a loophole in Federal banking law that allow the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to allow the relocation of bank headquarters within 30 miles of their present location without regards to state boundaries and state regulations.[33] So U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced that they plan to transfer the existing branches of the First National Bank of Spokane to the U.S. Bancorp of Washington and then ask permission from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to move the headquarters of First National from Spokane, Washington, to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. After receiving Federal approval, First National was finally moved in February 1992 and renamed U.S. Bank of Idaho.[34]
In July 1990, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Auburn, California-based HeartFed Financial Corporation with its Heart Federal Savings and Loan subsidiary for $107.8 million in stock.[35] At the time of the announcement, Heart Federal Savings had 29 branch offices in northern California. The acquisition was completed in March 1991 for $118 million.[36]
In November 1991, Edmund P. Jensen was given the post of chief operating officer in addition to his duties as president, making him a possible successor to Breezley.[37]
In February 1992, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the 20 branch offices in Northern California and 29 branch offices in Nevada for $70 million that were being divested by Bankamerica Corporation as a result of Bank of America's impending acquisition of Security Pacific Corporation.[38][39][40] This acquisition gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first presence in the state of Nevada.
Another major change in the organization of leadership in U.S. Bancorp of Oregon occurred in January 1993. While retaining his position as chief operating officer, Edmund P. Jensen was appointed vice chairman while giving his position of president to Kevin R. Kelly. At the same time, Gerry B. Cameron was appointed vice chairman.[41] Ten months later, Jensen resigned to become president of Visa International.[42] In January 1994, Gerry Cameron was first appointed chief operating officer as a replacement to Jensen[43] and later appointed chief executive officer just three weeks later.[44] Kelly submitted his resignation as president in March 1994[45] and Breezley finally gave up the chairmanship to Cameron in April 1994.[46][47]
In May 1995, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Boise, Idaho-based West One Bancorp for $1.8 billion.[48][49] At the time of the announcement, West One had branch offices in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Utah while U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had branch offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada. The acquisition was completed in December 1995 and gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first entry into the state of Utah.[50] As part of the acquisition deal, West One's chairman and chief executive Daniel R. Nelson would become the chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp and he would later be Cameron's successor as chairman and CEO upon Cameron's planned retirement in three years. Since both U.S. Bancorp and West One had overlapping territories in Oregon and Washington, the U.S. Justice Department would only allow the acquisition to proceed if U.S. Bancorp would sell off 27 branch offices in Washington and Oregon.[51] As a result of the regulatory ruling, U.S. Bancorp sold 25 branch offices in Oregon, four in central Washington and one in Idaho to First Hawaiian Bank for $38 million in cash.[52][53]
In February 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the San Ramon, California-based California Bancshares for $309 million in stock.[54] California Bancshares had a total of 38 branches in the East San Francisco Bay Area in nine separate banks that included Alameda First National, Community First National, Modesto Banking Co., Commercial Bank of Fremont, Lamorinda National Bank, Bank of San Ramon Valley, Westside Bank, Concord Commercial Bank and Bank of Milipitas. The acquisition was completed in June 1996.[55]
In September 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the St. George, Utah-based Sun Capital Bancorp with its three-branch office Sun Capital Bank subsidiary for $15.5 million.[56] The acquisition was completed in January 1997.[57]
In December 1996, Daniel R. Nelson, president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, unexpectedly announced his early retirement effective on New Year’s Day 1997. Nelson was originally in line to be Gerry B. Cameron's successor as chairman and chief executive upon the Cameron's planned retirement on New Year's Day 1999.[58]
In December 1996, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon announced the pending acquisition of the Sacramento, California-based Business & Professional Bank for $35 million in cash.[59] The acquisition was completed in May 1997.[60]
First Bank System era[edit]

In March 1997, the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based First Bank System announced the pending acquisition of the Portland, Oregon-based U.S. Bancorp of Oregon for $9 billion in stock.[61][62][63] At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had banking offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Utah while First Bank System had banking offices in Minnesota, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. Under the terms of the acquisition, First Bank System would be renamed U.S. Bancorp with the headquarters for the newly combined company being at First Bank's existing headquarters in Minneapolis. John F. Grundhofer, chairman and chief executive of First Bank, was appointed president and chief executive of the new company while Gerry B. Cameron, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, was appointed chairman of the new company, which he held until his retirement in 1998. The acquisition was completed in August 1997.[64] Approximately 4000 jobs were eliminated, mostly in Portland.[65]
U.S. Bancorp after takeover by First Bank System[edit]
In September 1997, the new U.S. Bancorp, formerly First Bank System, announced the pending acquisition of the St. Cloud, Minnesota-based Zappco, Inc. with its three banks and six banking locations for an disclosed amount.[66] At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had more than 1,000 banking offices in the states of Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, California, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, Nevada, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Utah, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. The acquisition was completed in December 1997.[67]
In March 1998, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Vancouver, Washington-based Northwest Bancshares with its 10-branch offices Northwest National Bank subsidiary for an undisclosed amount.[68][69] In October 1998, the U.S. Justice Department agreed to allow the acquisition to proceed on the condition that one of the Northwest National Bank branch offices was to be sold.[70] The acquisition was completed in December 1998 after U.S. Bancorp sold the request banking office to Centennial Bank of Eugene.[71]
At the end of 1998, Gerry Cameron retired as chairman and handed the position over to John Grundhofer who added the title of chairman to his other positions of president and chief executive officer.[72][73]
In February 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Bank of Commerce with its 10 branch offices for $314 million in stock.[74][75][76] The acquisition was finalized in July 1999.[77]
In May 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Newport Beach, California-based Western Bancorp with its Santa Monica Bank and Southern California Bank subidiaries and a total of 31 branch offices for $904 million in stock.[78][79] At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had 98 branch offices within California. The acquisition was finalized in November 1999 for $1.04 billion in stock.[80][81]
In July 1999, Philip G. Heasley was appointed president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp. John Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Heasley while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer.[82][83] Heasley had assisted Grundhofer in turning the company around from near insolvency when the company was originally known as First Bank until it became a successful financial institution that became large enough to be absorb other banks, including U.S. Bancorp of Oregon in 1997. Heasley resigned the following year to join Bank One as the head of their First USA credit card unit[84] around the same time Firstar was about to takeover U.S. Bancorp.
In September 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Peninsula Bank with its 11 branch offices for $104 million in stock.[85][86][87][88] In early January 2000, a group of Peninsula Bank stockholders tried to stop the merger because the initial merger agreement was made prior to the huge 27% single-day drop in the value of U.S. Bancorp stock which effectively lowered the purchase price.[89] The acquisition was later completed in January 2000 at a 10% reduction of the original price negotiated.[90]
In June 2000, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Scripps Financial Corporation with its nine-branch office Scripps Bank subsidiary for $155 million in stock.[91] The acquisition was completed in October 2000.[92]
Firstar era[edit]
In October 2000, Firstar Corporation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin announced the pending acquisition of U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis, Minnesota for $21 Billion in stock.[93][94][95] Firstar completed its buyout of U.S. Bancorp on February 27, 2001 and changed its name to U.S. Bancorp.[96] Under the merger agreement, Jerry Grundhofer, president and chief executive officer of Firstar, would continue in those positions in the combined company while his older brother, John Grundhofer, chairman, president and chief executive officer of U.S. Bancorp, would serve as chairman of the board in the combined company until his planned retirement on December 31, 2002.[95][97] Though some administrative functions would remain in Milwaukee and Cincinnati, it was decided that the new combined company would be based in Minneapolis and that the new company would use the U.S. Bancorp name.
To allow the merger to proceed, the U.S. Department of Justice required Firstar to sell 11 branch offices in the Minneapolis-area and 2 in Council Bluffs, Iowa.[98] Bremer Bank of Saint Paul, Minnesota purchased the 11 Minneapolis-area Firstar offices[99][100] while Liberty Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa purchased the 2 Council Bluffs offices.[101][102]
Brief history of Firstar prior to acquisition[edit]
Main article: Firstar Corporation
Although the origin of the Milwaukee-based Firstar Corporation can be traced back to the founding of the Farmer's and Millers Bank in Milwaukee in 1853 and the later formation of the First Wisconsin National Bank in 1919, the actual company that took over U.S. Bancorp in 2001 is the actually the same company and leadership that was responsible for the takeover of Firstar 27 months earlier in 1988, namely Star Banc Corporation. Jerry Grundhofer and his team from Star Banc were instrumental in both acquisitions. The stock and company histories for the current U.S. Bancorp is derive from that for the First National Cincinnati Corporation, a predecessor of Star Banc Corporation, and the First National Bank of Cincinnati that was founded in 1863.

U.S. Bancorp, the Portland-based financial services company, will buy Western Independent Bancshares Inc. in Auburn for $4.25 million in cash under the terms of a definitive agreement announced yesterday. Western Independent Bancshares is the parent company of Auburn Valley Bank, which had year-end assets of $44.6 million and offices in Auburn and Kent. The previously announced acquisition, which requires the approval of Western Independent Bancshares shareholders and regulators, is one of several pending or completed by U.S. Bancorp this year. The company completed the acquisition of Mt Baker Bank in Bellingham last month, and has agreements to purchase Northwestern Commercial Bank, also in Bellingham, and the Bank of Loleta in Eureka, Calif. 
^ Sorensen, Donald J. (October 19, 1989). "U.S. Bancorp Buys Women-Founded Sacramento Bank". The Oregonian. p. E17. (Subscription required (help)). U.S. Bancorp continued its expansion into Northern California by announcing Wednesday that it has agreed to acquire Mother Lode Savings Bank of Sacramento for about $5.3 million. Mother Lode, which has assets of $107.7 million and three offices, was founded by women in 1980 as a savings and loan to encourage business development by women in the area. It was later changed to a savings bank and expanded its operations... It is one of the first acquisitions of a thrift by a commercial bank in the nation since legislation permitting such takeovers. However, the savings bank is healthy and it was not a rescue effort, U.S. Bancorp said... When the transaction is completed, expected early next year, the bank will become part of U.S. Bank of California, a Bancorp subsidiary. The California unit was formed early last year with the acquisition of the $143 million-in-assets Bank of Loleta in Eureka, Calif.

^ Howe, Kenneth (July 29, 1991). "U.S. Bancorp on Northern California Buying Spree". San Francisco Chronicle. p. B1. (Subscription required (help)). U.S. Bancorp, with $18.6 billion in assets, is the country's 35th biggest bank. Breezley's goal is to get it among the top 20 banks by 1994. Even if the bigger banks were to stop growing, U.S. Bancorp would have to expand by 70 percent over the next 3 1/2 years to achieve the goal. But that may not be as difficult as it sounds. The company has tripled in size since 1983... Started from scratch 2 1/2 years ago, the company's U.S. Bank of California unit, with about $1.4 billion in assets, already is the seventh-largest bank headquartered in Northern California. Forming U.S. Bank of California after buying the tiny Bank of Loleta in Eureka at the end of 1988, Breezley added Sacramento's Mother Lode Savings in 1990 and Auburn's HeartFed Financial Corp. and Petaluma's Northbay Financial this year... Much of U.S. Bancorp's growth has occurred in the state of Washington, where the company has made six acquisitions in four years and where U.S. Bank of Washington, with $5.4 billion in assets, is now the third-largest bank. Breezley's next target is Idaho, where his blend of caution and aggression is evident. Tejera said that last year U.S. Bancorp tried three times to buy Idaho institutions: First National Bank of North Idaho in Wallace, Mountain West Savings Bank of Coeur d'Alene and Boise-based West One Bancorp. "They played it very conservative in those attempts, walking away when the price got too steep," he said.

The leadership change -- effective immediately -- was announced Wednesday night following an afternoon meeting of the company's directors. A statement by Breezley said he had recommended that the functions of chairman and chief executive be split. The change, he said, allows him to focus on oversight.

The acquisition would boost U.S. Bancorp's total assets from $21.4 billion to more than $30 billion, solidifying its position as the largest Northwest-owned bank... The merger cements U.S. Bancorp's position as the largest bank in Oregon. It also will become the largest institution in Idaho and move from fifth-largest to third-largest in Washington. West One also gives U.S. Bancorp its first entry into Utah. The acquisition probably will raise antitrust concerns among Justice Department lawyers. U.S. Bancorp acknowledged that it probably will have to divest assets in certain markets, especially the Portland metropolitan area, to gain government approval... The acquisition clears up speculation about who U.S. Bancorp's next chief executive will be. As part of the deal, the Portland bank named West One's chairman and chief executive, Dan Nelson, its own chief operating officer and president. What's more, Nelson will assume the bank's helm after Cameron retires in three years.

Business Description








	


U.S. Bancorp, headquartered in Minneapolis, is the 8th largest financial services 
holding company in the United States.
Through U.S. BankŽ and other subsidiaries, U.S. Bancorp serves 11.6 million 
  customers, primarily through 2,243 full-service branch offices in 24 states. 
  Customers also access their accounts and conduct all or part of their banking 
  transactions through 4,425 U.S. Bank ATMs, U.S. Bank Internet Banking and telephone 
  banking. In addition, a network of specialized U.S. Bancorp offices and representatives 
  across the nation serves customers inside and outside our 24-state footprint 
  through comprehensive product sets that meet the financial needs of customers 
  beyond basic core banking. Backed by expertise and advanced technology, these 
  sophisticated U.S. Bancorp products and services include large corporate services, 
  payment services, private banking, personal and institutional trust services, 
  corporate trust services, specialized large-scale government banking services, 
  mortgage, commercial credit vehicles, and financial and asset management services. 

Major lines of business provided by U.S. Bancorp through U.S. Bank and other 
  subsidiaries include Consumer Banking; Payment Services; Private Client, Trust 
  & Asset Management; and Wholesale Banking. U.S. Bank is home of the exclusive 
  U.S. Bank Five Star Service Guarantee. 
The subsidiaries range in size from $26 million to $128 billion in deposits 
  and provide a wide range of products and services to individuals, businesses, 
  institutional organizations, governmental entities and other financial institutions. 
  Commercial and consumer lending services are principally offered to customers 
  within the Companys domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations 
  and within certain niche national venues. Lending services include traditional 
  credit products as well as credit card services, financing and import/export 
  trade, asset-backed lending, agricultural finance and other products. Leasing 
  products are offered through bank leasing subsidiaries. 
Depository services include checking accounts, savings accounts and time certificate 
  contracts. Ancillary services such as foreign exchange, treasury management 
  and receivable lock-box collection are provided to corporate customers. U.S. 
  Bancorps bank and trust subsidiaries provide a full range of asset management 
  and fiduciary services for individuals, estates, foundations, business corporations 
  and charitable organizations. 
U.S. Bancorps non-banking subsidiaries primarily offer investment and insurance 
  products to the Companys customers principally within its markets and mutual 
  fund processing services to a broad range of mutual funds. 

Banking and investment services are provided through a network of 2,343 banking 
  offices principally operating in 24 states in the Midwest and West. The Company 
  operates a network of 4,425 branded ATMs and provides 24-hour, seven day a week 
  telephone customer service. Mortgage banking services are provided through banking 
  offices and loan production offices throughout the Companys markets. 

Consumer lending products may be originated through banking offices, indirect 
  correspondents, brokers or other lending sources, and a consumer finance division. 
  The Company is also one of the largest providers of VisaŽ corporate and purchasing 
  card services and corporate trust services in the United States. A wholly-owned 
  subsidiary, NOVA Information Systems, Inc., provides merchant processing services 
  directly to merchants and through a network of banking affiliations. 
U.S. Bancorp meets the diverse financial needs of our customers by providing 
  innovative, creative answers through specialized lines of business. Across 24 
  states and beyond, our experienced bankers share ideas, best practices, capabilities 
  and cross-sell opportunities, supported by advanced technology and operating 
  systems. The results are competitive benefits for our customers and competitive 
  advantages for U.S. Bancorp. 
Competition. The commercial banking business is highly competitive. Subsidiary 
  banks compete with other commercial banks and with other financial institutions, 
  including savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, 
  mortgage banking companies, credit unions and investment companies. In recent 
  years, competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory 
  restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies.

You may not have heard a lot about us. And that’s by design.

From the start, we’ve spent most of our time and efforts behind the scenes, putting the companies who work with us - and their goals - first. We’ve remained in the background, offering them the guidance, innovative thinking, and operational support they need to succeed. Whether expanding business, increasing profitability, bringing existing financial products to new audiences or creating entirely new financial products and services –take a close look behind some of the world’s most successful companies: that’s where you’ll find The Bancorp.
Today we’ve grown far from our roots as a branchless commercial bank to become a true financial services leader, offering private-label banking and technology solutions to non-bank companies ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to those on the Fortune 500. Over the years, our strategic focus on a handful of high-growth financial service sectors such as Payments, Health Benefit Banking, Institutional Banking, and Specialized Lending has resulted in tremendous organizational growth and widespread recognition. We now comprise a diverse team that includes bankers, business strategists, fintech experts, software developers, program managers, regulatory advisors, information security specialists and category thought leaders, all eager to provide their wide-ranging expertise in new and innovative ways. No other organization does what we do. And no other organization delivers what we can deliver.
