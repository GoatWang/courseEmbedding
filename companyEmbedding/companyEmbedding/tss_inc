What our customers are saying…



                    Ketchikan may be an encapsulated (on an island) community, but we are really lucky to have some superb services like TSS that wouldn’t ordinarily be available in a town this size. Today businesses need to be proactive and TSS is dynamic and motivated to provide a wealth of services!

                    Having worked 2 winters for TSS Inc , I would say their work ethic and commitment to doing the right thing goes above and beyond any companies in their field. We are also a customer of TSS Inc. with our guide service.I am one of the few that can say both as a employee and a customer that TSS Inc is a great company to work for or with!

                    As a company operating in several remote Southeast Alaska communities, it is sometimes difficult to get the safety and compliance services you need in a timely fashion; TSS consistently provides comprehensive and confidential service with competitive pricing and great turnaround times.
