What are 'Pooled Funds'
Pooled funds are funds from many individual investors that are aggregated for the purposes of investment, as in the case of a mutual or pension fund. Investors in pooled fund investments benefit from economies of scale, which allow for lower trading costs per dollar of investment, diversification and professional money management. Along with the added costs involved in the form of management fees, the main detractor of pooled fund investments is that capital gains are spread evenly among all investors — sometimes at the expense of new shareholders.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Pooled Funds'
      Groups such as investment clubs, partnerships and trusts use pooled funds to invest in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The pooled account lets the investors be treated as a single account holder, allowing them to buy more shares.Pros and Cons of Pooled FundsGroups of investors can take advantage of opportunities typically available to only large investors. In addition, investors save on transaction costs and further diversify their portfolios. However, the individual investor has less control over the group’s investment decisions than he would making the decisions alone. In addition, each investor has different goals, risk levels and exit strategies. Therefore, not all group decisions are best for each individual in the group. Also, the group must reach a consensus before deciding what to purchase. When the market is volatile, taking the time and effort to reach an agreement can take away opportunities for quick profits or reducing potential losses.Advantages of Mutual FundsMutual funds spread their holdings across various investment vehicles, reducing the effect any single security or class of securities has on the overall portfolio. Because mutual funds contain hundreds or thousands of securities, investors are less affected if one security underperforms.Professionals manage non-index mutual funds, ensuring investors receive the best risk-return tradeoff aligning with their objectives. This helps investors who lack the time and knowledge for managing their own portfolios. Mutual funds allow reinvestment of dividends and interest for additional fund shares. The investor saves money by not paying transaction fees while growing his portfolio. Mutual funds also offer a range of investment options for the highly aggressive, mildly aggressive and risk-adverse investor. Most investors can purchase mutual funds to help meet their objectives.Disadvantages of Mutual FundsWhen investing in a mutual fund, an investor gives control to the money manager running it.An investor is taxed when the fund sells individual stocks and distributes capital gains. If the fund sells holdings often, capital gains distributions could happen annually, increasing an investor’s taxable income. Exceptions include investing via a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), Roth IRA or employer-sponsored plan such as a 401(k).Some mutual funds assess a load, or sales charge, on all purchases. All mutual funds charge annual expenses as the cost of doing business. Because the expense ratio is expressed as a percentage, the investor pays annually a portion of his account value, which lowers his gains.

 The No Boundaries Roadway Maintenance Practices pooled fund project, #TPF-5(330), facilitates the implementation of proven, ready-to-deploy maintenance innovations. Email No BoundariesSubscribe to this newsletter 







 Welcome! This newsletter from the national No Boundaries consortium features the latest updates on the group's activities and compiles recent research, state practices, and training opportunities related to non-winter roadway maintenance from around the country.







 News from No Boundaries 








  Upcoming TRB Webinar to Feature No Boundaries   No Boundaries partner consultant Diana Clonch of DW Clonch, LLC, will give a No Boundaries presentation titled Recruitment and Retention of the Maintenance Work Force: National, State and Local Agency Examples as part of an upcoming Transportation Research Board webinar. Clonch recently gave a similar version of this presentation at the 2017 TRB Annual Meeting, where it garnered much interest and fostered useful dialogue. The upcoming TRB webinar, "The Evolving Surface Transportation Maintenance and Operations Workforce, Part II: Developing a More Versatile Workforce Through Enhanced Training and Technology," will be held Thursday, April 6, 2017, from 1:00 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Eastern time. This is the second in a series of webinars on the surface transportation workforce; the first webinar was conducted in August 2016. The lineup of presentations to be given by Clonch and her co-presenters is as follows:

Overview of surface transportation workforce demographics
Public transportation training and apprenticeship models
Synopsis of relevant NCHRP studies
Recruitment and retention of the maintenance workforce
Question and answer session
 Participants should register in advance of the webinar. There is no attendance fee for employees of state DOTs and other TRB sponsor organizations, and 1.5 professional development hours can be earned by attending. 












  2017 TRB Annual Meeting Maintenance Papers  For the second year, No Boundaries has compiled and published a compendium of maintenance-related papers from the Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting. The 2017 compendium includes abstracts for 52 papers grouped into 10 categories covering a wide range of non-winter maintenance issues. Both the current and past editions are available on the No Boundaries Resources/Links web page. As noted in the compendium, TRB requires a login to access full papers. Users requiring access should check with their DOT or other transportation library.

 Training Opportunities 







  Maintenance and Roadway Operations Workshop  The International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association will hold its 2017 Maintenance and Roadway Operations Workshop May 21-23 in New Orleans. The maintenance track of educational presentations will include sessions on asset management in bridge and tunnel maintenance, work zone safety, and innovation and technology in maintenance. The workshop will also include general sessions, a roadway operations track, technical tours and an exhibit hall. 













 Asset Management Research 







  Pavement Management Systems: Putting Data to WorkNCHRP Synthesis 501   Pavement management systems can help agencies optimize the use of their available funding, communicate funding needs, and objectively manage their pavement network. This synthesis identified current pavement management practices used at state and provincial transportation agencies, particularly for use in resource allocation, analyzing the cost-effectiveness of treatments, program development, and communication with stakeholders. The project found that most agencies develop customized pavement deterioration models and treatment rules using such data variables as pavement type, functional condition, highway system, treatment history and traffic data. Report. 












  Framework for a Pavement-Maintenance Database SystemNCHRP Report 820   This project developed a framework for a pavement maintenance database, including a uniform format for collecting, reporting and storing information on pavement maintenance activities. A common framework would promote compatibility of maintenance data reported by different agencies and could provide an effective way to use data in cost-benefit analysis. The report includes a DVD that contains the pavement maintenance database and a CD that contains sample data; both can be downloaded as ISO images. Report. 












  Element Level Bridge Inspection: Benefits and Use of Data for Bridge ManagementIndiana DOT/Purdue University Joint Transportation Research Program Report  The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) requires the collection and submission of element-level bridge inspection data for all National Highway System bridges. This project used a survey of Indiana DOT peer agencies and a review of literature and bridge inspection guides to develop recommendations for element-level bridge inspection techniques, data collection, and inspector training. The study found that while data required by the Federal Highway Administration is sufficient in the short term, INDOT's inspection program should be expanded over time to make it more useful. Additionally, a rigorous training program with detailed quality control procedures will be needed to ensure data reliability. Report.












 Historical Performance Evaluation of Iowa Pavement Treatments Using Data AnalyticsMidwest Transportation Center Report  Iowa's pavement network has reached maturity, making maintenance and rehabilitation more important than new construction. Iowa DOT needed to evaluate the performance of maintenance and rehabilitation activities to better predict their impacts and support cost-effective decision-making. Pavement condition data is stored in Iowa DOT's geographic information system, but not in a format compatible with the department's preservation and rehabilitation data. To integrate the two databases, this project used GIS tools and methods including the department's linear referencing system to compare pavement conditions before and after treatments. The project found that rutting and International Roughness Index are the most consistent performance indicators and made several recommendations to maximize the benefits of collected data. Report.











 Benchmarking the Operations and Maintenance of New Zealand's Roading SectorNew Zealand Transport Agency Research Report  Transportation agencies sometimes have to determine appropriate levels of investment for maintenance and operations of their infrastructure without having adequate information to make that determination. Using benchmark data from similar agencies can help to clarify what constitutes an appropriate investment, and help better understand the overall performance of complex systems like highway maintenance. This project documented existing benchmarking methodologies used in New Zealand and around the world and evaluated best practices, opportunities, and barriers and risks in benchmarking. A value-for-money equation originally developed for not-for-profit organizations has also worked well for highway maintenance, and Data Envelopment Analysis was found to be helpful in normalizing for unique characteristics. Report. 











  Migration Probability Matrix for Bridge Element Deterioration ModelsTRB Annual Meeting Paper 17-01378   Transportation agencies are required to develop transportation asset management plans that feature life cycle cost analysis for bridges, including deterioration models. No DOTs yet have sufficient element inspection data to support this deterioration modeling. This project, conducted for Florida DOT, suggested a readily implementable migration probability matrix that encapsulates the differences between Florida's bridge element inspection data gathered under AASHTO's 1998 Guide to Commonly Recognized Structural Elements and data gathered using Florida's 2016 inspection manual. This matrix can be used to adjust deterioration models developed using the older data to make it compatible with inspection data gathered under the new manual. Conference paper. 











 Bridge Repair and Rehabilitation Research 







  Continuous Long-Term Health Monitoring Using Ultrasonic Wave PropagationNebraska Department of Roads Report   Reinforced concrete bridge decks are exposed to harsh loading and environmental conditions, making them susceptible to deterioration. Delamination is a common flaw caused by chloride salts, moisture and oxygen in the environment. DOTs commonly use a variety of non-destructive techniques to detect delamination in bridge decks, but this practice is only used to detect existing delamination. This project investigated whether ultrasonic wave propagation and a specific sensor arrangement can monitor and identify the onset of delamination, which could detect delamination before serious problems develop. Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of the approach, and a follow-up project will work to expand the application of the method and make it practical for widespread implementation. Report. 












  Climate Change Impact on Management of Deteriorating Bridges: A Case Study of U.S. Midwest RegionTRB Annual Meeting Paper 17-04849  Many reinforced concrete bridges in the United States are at least 50 years old and suffering degradation due to environmental stressors. While this deterioration has been studied, environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and precipitation have changed due to climate change effects. This project investigated the impact of climate change on the deterioration of reinforced concrete bridges in the Midwest, including its role in altering the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as floods. Conference paper.











  Long-Term Maintenance of the Anthony Wayne Suspension Bridge Main CablesOhio DOT Report  The Anthony Wayne Bridge, the only suspension bridge in Ohio, is undergoing a significant rehabilitation. Acoustic emission sensors to monitor the condition of the bridge's cables have already been installed, and a dehumidification system will be installed. This project investigated the potential use of the Analatom AN110 corrosion sensor on the bridge to measure corrosion rates in real time. Tests found that the sensor can consistently record changes in corrosion due to changes in the environment to ensure that dehumidification proceeds as expected. Report.












 Culvert Maintenance Research 







  Using Remote Data Collection to Identify Bridges and Culverts Susceptible to Blockage During Flooding EventsUniversity of Vermont Transportation Research Center Report   When debris blocks culverts and bridges, it can cause flooding at lower flow volumes than predicted by floodplain delineations. This project pilot-tested the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle to gather stereo imagery of streambeds upstream of crossing structures and developed a process to rapidly transmit that information via email or text message. The UAV can be rapidly deployed and output data can be provided in less than 48 hours, which makes it suitable for high-risk crossings. Report. 












 Emergency Maintenance Operations Research 







  Post-Extreme Event Damage Assessment and Response for Highway BridgesNCHRP Synthesis 497  This synthesis reviews procedures used by state and local transportation departments to assess damage to bridges in response to extreme events, including earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, floods, truck crashes and terrorist attacks. Collisions, primarily caused by over-height vehicles, were the most common source of bridge failure, followed by failures caused by hydraulic sources such as scour or flood and debris flow. All agencies surveyed for the synthesis reported using visual inspection as the first tool when assessing bridge damage, with nondestructive testing commonly used as a secondary approach to better locate and measure damage. The synthesis found that most states have emergency response plans for extreme events, but not all of those plans are tailored for response to bridge damage. Report.













 Funding and Budgeting Research 







  Development of a Cost Index for In-House Roadway Maintenance Work for the North Carolina Department of TransportationTRB Annual Meeting Paper 17-01670  A cost index that represents how maintenance costs change over time is useful to transportation agencies for developing work plans and budgets over multiple years. FHWA's Highway Maintenance and Operations Cost Index was discontinued in 1990, and since then, state transportation agencies have had to use available cost indices that are not specific to roadway maintenance. This project developed cost indices for North Carolina DOT representing in-house maintenance in the Roadside, Maintenance, Traffic and Bridge categories of the maintenance budget and then combined them into a composite index. The methodology should overcome the limitations of FHWA's previous index, including the number of tasks included, outdated units of measure, and lack of guidance about goods and tasks included. Conference paper.











 Pavement Repair and Rehabilitation Research 







  Systems Preservation Guide: A Planning Process for Local Government Management of Transportation NetworksMinnesota DOT Report  Local agencies are facing severe challenges in keeping roads safe and in good repair, including aging infrastructure, increasing material costs, and stagnant or decreasing funding levels. Some local governments have considered unpaving roads, but this is only one solution and likely to be unpopular except as a last resort. This project developed an interactive resource guide, including research, tools, and strategies to help local agencies communicate transportation system preservation needs to elected officials and the public. The guide helps agencies define their preservation needs, select preservation strategies, select communication strategies, and review lessons learned from pilot counties in Minnesota. Report.












  Ranking of Pavement Preservation Practices and MethodsSouth Carolina DOT Report  Pavement preservation represents a proactive approach to maintaining road networks. This project sought to identify methods to improve the implementation of pavement preservation strategies on asphalt roadways in South Carolina, with particular attention paid to pavements in the Non-Federal Aid secondary system. Recommendations to help improve the state's roadway health include methods to identify pavement sections that are candidates for preservation activities, a local-level pavement evaluation system, a preservation treatment selection support tool, a methodology for tracking treatments to support future benefit-cost analysis, and training materials for DOT personnel. Report.












 Preventing Transverse Bumps and Cracks in New Asphalt Overlays Over Crack SealantsColorado DOT Report  Crack sealing is a common method for preserving asphalt pavements by preventing water intrusion into the pavement foundation. However, hot-mix asphalt overlays placed on top of pavements containing crack sealants sometimes develop bumps and transverse cracking. This five-year project sought to identify factors related to the appearance of these bumps and cracks. Researchers found that vibratory breakdown rolling, pavement gradients, sealant geometry, tack coat application rate and tack coat adhesivity are the factors that most contribute to the occurrence of bumps and transverse cracks during overlay construction. Additional observations suggest that bumps and cracks are proportional to the size of the "bow wave" of asphalt in front of the breakdown roller, which is dependent on mixture properties, roller size, speed, vibration characteristics, and pavement gradient. Report.











  Performance-Related Specifications for Emulsified Asphaltic Binders Used in Preservation Surface TreatmentsNCHRP Research Report 837  The properties of the asphaltic binder used in a pavement preservation surface treatment are important to the treatment's performance. In practice, however, binders are often selected based on availability rather than performance. This project produced recommended emulsion performance grade specifications for emulsions used in chip seals, microsurfacing, and spray seals. It also evaluated tests of binder properties and developed test protocols for properties for which test methods previously were not available. Report.












  Algorithm and Software for Proactive Pothole RepairIndiana DOT/Purdue University Joint Transportation Research Program Report  Typically, when potholes appear in pavement, a repair crew is dispatched to patch the hole intending that the patch will last until a more permanent repair can be made. This reactive approach means that potholes are often repaired too late to prevent further damage, and it results in inefficient deployment of repair crews. This study investigated the relation between traffic loads, winter weather records, and the number of potholes requiring patching to attempt to develop a model to predict pothole formation. The research showed that traffic loads are more important to the formation of potholes on interstate highways than urban US highways and urban and rural state routes, but that temperature is more important than traffic loads on rural routes. While the findings are encouraging, the project did not produce implementable results. Report.












  Chicago's Lake Shore Drive: A Case Study for Rapid Response to Blowups and Concrete Joint InvestigationTRB Annual Meeting Paper 17-06425  Lake Shore Drive is one of Chicago's major thoroughfares and is composed of jointed plain concrete pavement with epoxy-coated dowel bar reinforcement in the transverse joints. Extreme weather exposure and aging pavement has led to multiple pavement failures. This project formulated and oversaw a repair procedure to eliminate further distresses and restore long-term ride quality and structural stability while meeting the city's logistical constraints for traffic closures. Using a patching material containing stone matrix asphalt with fractionated recycled asphalt product, recycled asphalt shingles, and ground-tire rubber was found to be a sustainable approach that would stand up to the highway's long-term environmental and traffic demands. Conference paper.












  Development of Recommended Guidelines for Preservation Treatments for Bicycle RoutesCalifornia Department of Transportation Report  This project was a follow-up to a previous study that evaluated the effects of pavement macrotexture on bicycle ride quality. This study included a wider range of riders and bicycle types, considered roughness and distresses, and included measurements on urban streets, state highways, and county roads. Findings included that changes in Caltrans' chip seal gradation specifications resulted in higher macrotexture values; that most slurry seals on city streets produced high acceptability rates; and that the presence of distresses (particularly cracking) lowers the ratings that riders give to pavements. Report.

How to Fund Your Movie: A Guide to the Basics of Film Finance



 



Financing is an important (and often dreaded) aspect of the making of any movie. Without money, films can't exist, but it's often the topic with the least amount of information floating around. If you're considering funding a movie or producing a film, Matthew Helderman has come up with a handy guide to get you started understanding all of the different ways you can get financing for a movie.

This is a guest post by Matthew Helderman of Buffalo8 and BondIt.


The difficulty in raising capital for any venture is two-fold: firstly, the market is crowded with opportunities that are currently earning strong returns. The stock markets, the bond markets and the traditional high yield sectors of real-estate, speciality finance and lending all present solid outlooks financially. Secondly, speculation is the killer of many financial deals. Who wants to invest in an opportunity when the return not only is unlikely, but the timeline is completely unknown?

When raising capital for a film project -- even more elements come in to play: talent, timeline, creative, and multiple financiers needing to feel comfortable with the structures and scheduling. Having raised capital many times in the past -- our overview here is a sample of the realities currently presented in the private equity financing arena of independent feature films -- and furthermore our eBook details a breakdown on best-practices for structuring raise specifics.



Before we go any further, let's define the most common categories of film finance.

What are the different kinds of film financing?
Equity
Hard cash investments made to your project by a single investor, a group of investors, and personal investments from colleagues/family. Equity investments require that the investor own a stake in the ﬁlm (the LLC or operating structure) and must be paid back (typically on their principal investment + 20%) before proﬁt is seen on the side of the filmmakers.

Pre-Sales
Pre-sales agreements are pre-arranged and executed contracts made with distributors before the ﬁlm is produced. These agreements are based on the strength of the project's marketability and sales potential in each given territory. A distributor will generate a value for your project given the script, the attached talent, and crew, as well as the marketing approach, and then enable you to take out a bank loan using the pre-sales deal as collateral. Pre-sales can also result in direct payment (at a discounted rate) from the buyer themselves. Pre-sales investments require that the producer pay back the bank its loaned capital before proﬁting on their respective upside.

Gap
With partial equity raised you are then able to procure a loan from a bank or a private lender on the unsold territories of the ﬁlm (and additional elements of collateral such as the intellectual property “IP” or corporate guarantees). Gap financing is only available when other elements have been assembled and there is adequate security for the investor to “bridge” against.


 

Tax Incentives
Individual state and country legislation enables producers to subsidize spent costs for production. Tax incentives require a producer to hire a certain number of local crew employees, rent from local vendors, and run payroll through local services. Tax credits are based on an application process and are often lengthy (12-18 months) & difficult (tedious paperwork) to procure. Certain credits are sell-able, transferable, and even trade-able based on the local legislation. States such as New Mexico, North Carolina, Georgia, New York and Michigan offer the strongest solutions.

Deferred & Crowdfunding
Producers are able to avoid nearly all costs on a project if they are able to negotiate a deferred deal. Deferred agreements basically state that crew, cast, vendors, locations, and services are all rendered up front at no cost until the ﬁlm generates money upon release. Deferred financing is difficult because experienced cast and crew are unwilling to work under these types of structures. Crowdfunding (Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, etc.) enables a donations-based model for capital to be raised without selling equity.

Private Equity
Private equity investors are flooded with opportunities today, with the traditional markets performing well, the venture capital sector offering incredible teams and projects, and the re-emerging performance of real-estate and lending.


 

How do you make your project stand out to these investors?
We’d like to believe it’s as simple as a strong script, a great team with experience, and a game plan for success -- but it’s never that simple. The key factor to private equity investors is to remove speculation -- meaning, when are they going to start earning a return and can you guarantee that? The more speculation you remove (by utilizing the steps below), the better chance you’ll have of securing capital assets in “hard money."

Agencies
The talent agencies are a difficult nut to crack. They are well guarded, highly established, and protected entities. They are the gatekeepers of taste, talent and possibility -- and more than anything they are the lifeblood of the independent producer seeking to put projects together with financing.

Step number one is finding a piece of material that excites you and that you believe you can rally a team behind. Remember, you’ll be living with each film you produce for many years -- so choose wisely.

Once you have a piece of material, get an agent/agency excited about the project as well. As with most of the entertainment business, agents think in numbers --how much will my firm/I make from this deal? Incentivize the agency by offering them the ability to package the project -- place multiple roles with their roster rather than just one or two roles -- which gives them the ability to earn 10% of multiple deals across the board.

Furthermore, offer them the ability to have a first look opportunity for domestic sales representation -- again, finding ways to incentivize. By packaging these elements early on, you’ll be able to bring strong talent to the project and gear up to be more ready to approach equity players.

Strength of Team & Experience
A first time producer/director/star is a tough sell for many in the film business. Sales teams are unable to project value (pre-sell), agents are unable to place large name talent (packaging), and financiers are unable to gauge project ROI (basic returns).

Find a director who has carried a project before, find an agency who is interested in packaging and will keep you/your project in the stratosphere of content that matters, and you’ll be in a great starting position.

If you have to utilize unknown talents to make your project -- surround them with experience on all fronts. An unknown star with a strong director, DP, producer and writer is a reasonable recipe.


 

Tax Incentives/Pre-Sales/Debt/Domestic MG
With your packaged talent signed on, a strong team on board, and a well-developed script, you can now approach “soft money” options.

Tax incentives are nothing new, they offer a percentage of the in-state spend back in rebate form. Meaning, you can bankroll/cash-flow this piece to offset your investors risk.

Pre-sales are nothing new -- they offer projections of value based on the elements you’ve brought together. Meaning, you can bankroll/cash-flow this piece to offset your investors risk.

Debt options are nothing new -- is this starting to sound like a trend?

Try to find ways to cover 50 cents of every dollar your investor is putting up before the cameras even turn on.

Shoot in tax incentive rich states, with a strong pre-sold package, and with a great sales-team on-board to execute. You can then reduce the level of speculation and guarantee a return of X% based on Y investment in a tangible timeline.

Plan of Execution
With these elements on-board, make your investment proposal personable, professional, and tailored to your investors specifics. Do not pitch high level film financing to first-time entertainment investors. Keep it simple, above-board, and remind them that while smoke & mirrors often run throughout the business, you’re putting together a basic structure returning X% on Y investment over Z timeline -- they will respect you and your approach much more.

Lastly, look into completion/guarantor bonds as a way to assure your investors that the project will be completed on time, schedule, and budget, and with the elements they have agreed to finance. The liability is now removed via a bond company and their return is partially guaranteed via incentives and additional soft-money.

Pitch smart, often, and confidently knowing that you’ve done your homework and that the investment is well-structured for a return.

It's difficult to say with a straight face to investors that any independent film project has a good chance of return because the odds are really that it does not.
Hopefully the crowd funding model continues to evolve and dominates as it theoretically promotes a more sincere end product. 
Money gained from investors on shakey claims of financial return encourages the making of films focused primarily on financial return. More genre films, horror films, derivative films and endless films set in New Orleans and Atlanta cause that is where the tax breaks are.
Of course there is room for all types. Creativity and business are inseparable when making features,  I would just personally prefer to see ones that the content is driven by creativity more than the business.

Good thoughts. My hope is that crowd-funding will continue to evolve in the direction of creativity with a mix of balanced business principles.  My fear is that the biz will figure out how to manipulate the structure, and I worry government will regulate the innovation out of it.  I hope I am wrong about this.

If you think like a great producer you turn a negative into a positive. Be upfront about film investment being a straight up gamble . . . and then talk up the elements in your package that excite them, that make them think that if they win they can win big even if the odds are against.

What is the point of "talking it up" like this, though? If the producers ultimately do not get the return they are promised, that will inevitably become public information. (Shit spreads wider than margarine.) Whereupon, further proof is added to the pile that independent film is a no-go for investors.
With full respect to you, I must disagree with your definition of a great producer. Such a producer will not merely "talk it up" but actually find ways to realistically achieve the ROI they promise, even if that return is modest.
Who needs a "talker"? This town is full of those already.

I just can't stress enough the importance of self-funding, ie., not waiting til 'someone else' funds your project to make it. Call in favors, go thrift shopping, ask around. 
You don't need someone else's million dollars to make a movie that looks like a million bucks.

It's good to see some articles about the sharp end of producing here. We do need scripts, we do need to know about new camera's etc but without this kind of info you cannot sustain yourself and move from production to production and grow your business.

One thing they don't say about pre-sales is that to bank the contract the pre-sales agent (not distributor) has to be recognised by the bank as being reputable to take the pre-sales estimate seriously. Also the pre-sale estimate is base line, in other words it's the minimum guarantee value, otherwise known as the MG.
The other hiccup is that it's very unlikely a reputable sales agent will enter a MG without a star cast that is sellable in a variety of international territories. That means you have to generally enter into a pay or play agreement with the star. That means cash up front and a first day of principal photography date that's set in stone that if you fail to meet you lose the pay or play, which can be a few hundred thousand. That's high risk money and without it the rest of the contracts are unlikely to fall into place. Domino effect.
This is why funding low budget films through crowdfunding or direct investor relationships are much easier, although still difficult, to achieve.

I keep hearing about the LIST.
As in...LIST of acting talent who have big audience followings in other countries, territories outside the U.S.
As in...same LIST of same acting talent, that so many producers, pre sales agents use over and over to impress and try to guarantee reasonble profits to the money people, inotrder to get investment capital.
As in...same LIST of same acting talent,  all the STUDIOS use for overseas market-auds projections while in
the process of determining whether or not a certain genre movie has a more highly favorable process of profitabilty
with those specific acting talents in those specific overseas territories.
Lot of good points here in this article, but no mention of the LIST.
Guess access to market - auds information/demographics is more  important than a good script.

I make my movies cheaply because I know I'm not going to make money on them. My first film  Space Trucker Bruce (www.spacetruckerbruce.com) will probably never make a profit but at least I didn't borrow money or have investors to pay back. At the time I totally wanted to borrow and get investors at the time but I'm glad I didn't.  Now I pay my crew and actors what I can afford and get people who are interested.  The nice thing about crowd funding is people are not expecting profit but want to help you make the movie.

I like how Paul Osbourne put it, he said basically, when approaching investors you should have all your ducks in a row to show them that they have the potential to make money, but remember individuals don't invest in Low Budget Movies to make money they do it because they believe in the film, they want to be able to tell their friends they made a movie, and have fun with the process.
Now if we are talking studio budget films, then that's another story. With these Micro budgets and Low budget, find the people who can spend their "fun money" on an adventure they will enjoy, and work your butt off to get them their money so they can have another adventure with you on your next project.

Investment Company – this is a term you have probably come across while trying to work out your next steps.Well, it is usually some sort of trust or corporation that invests the pooled capital, i.e. assets such as money, of investors in financial securities, i.e. shares or bonds. They can either be publicly owned or privately owned. These investment companies will manage, market and sell funds to the public to gain investors. You can proceed to this sites for more information http://www.themoviefund.com/investing/investment-company.html

I am an independent filmmaker my company is Street Films3000 and I am looking for support for my second feature film. The first one I did it by myself and I practically did everything. Wrote it, Directed it, filmed it,part of the edition and even I wrote the lyrics for the songs that we use in it. I am glad to let you know that we were officially selected into eight international film festivals in 2015. That's why I want to work with someone else and create something even better.
