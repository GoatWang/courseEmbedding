MUSCATINE, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Iowa First Bancshares Corp. (OTC Pink:IOFB) today reported the highest
      second quarter net income in the Company's history. Consolidated net
      income of $1,140,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to
      net income of $1,081,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The
      increase in second quarter net income year-over-year of $59,000 (5.5%)
      was primarily attributable to higher net interest income of $244,000
      (6.6%). Noninterest income declined $24,000 (2.7%). Noninterest expense
      increased $29,000 (1.0%) and provision for loan losses was raised
      $105,000 or (100%). Income tax expense increased $27,000 (5.1%) when
      comparing the second quarter of 2017 to the same quarter in 2016. "We
      are very pleased to report record second quarter net income to our
      shareholders. Such performance is a direct result of the guidance
      provided by our board of directors, quality leadership of the management
      team and efficient execution of our community banking business plan by
      our dedicated team of bankers," said D. Scott Ingstad, Chairman,
      President and CEO.
    

      The Company recorded net income of $1,533,000 for the six months ended
      June 30, 2017, compared with net income of $2,081,000 for the two
      quarters ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $548,000 (26.3%). Over that
      time period, net interest income increased $328,000 (4.5%) and
      noninterest income increased $23,000 (1.3%). However, more than
      offsetting these income gains, noninterest expense increased $110,000
      (1.9%) and provision for loan losses was raised $1,080,000 (514%). This
      large percentage increase in the provision is the result of three
      primary factors: 1) comparison of this year's number to a relatively
      small provision for loan losses recognized in the prior year; 2) an
      increase in loans outstanding of $23,615,000 (6.1%) from June 30, 2016
      to June 30, 2017; and 3) replenishment of the allowance for loan losses
      following a year-over-year increase of $1,031,000 in net loan
      charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the first
      six months of 2016. Income tax expense declined $291,000 (28.0%).
    

      Basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.36 for the six months ended
      June 30, 2017, down $.48 or 26.1% from the same period in 2016. The
      Company's annualized return on average assets for the first two quarters
      of 2017 and 2016 was .64% and .90%, respectively. The Company's
      annualized return on average equity for the six months ended June 30,
      2017 and June 30, 2016 was 6.8% and 9.1%, respectively.
    

      Total assets at June 30, 2017 were $486,077,000, an increase of
      $11,706,000 (2.5%) from June 30, 2016. As noted above, gross loans
      outstanding increased $23,615,000 (6.1%), while total deposits increased
      $10,573,000 (2.6%) year-over-year. The allowance for loan losses totaled
      $4,782,000 at June 30, 2017, or 1.17% of gross loans outstanding. Net
      loans charged-off during the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were
      $1,180,000 and $149,000, respectively. Nonaccrual loans totaled $2.3
      million or .6% of gross loans outstanding at June 30, 2017, compared to
      $2.2 million of gross loans outstanding at June 30, 2016.
    

      The board of directors declared a $.29 per common share cash dividend to
      be paid on July 25, 2017, to shareholders of record July 3, 2017. On an
      annualized basis this dividend represents a return of 3.1% on the
      December 31, 2016 stock price. Iowa First Bancshares Corp. has paid a
      cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1989.

      organizations through its two wholly-owned national banks located in

      This press release may contain forward-looking statements. Investors are
      cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and
      uncertainties, and many factors could cause actual results to differ
      materially from the results anticipated or projected. Our ability to
      predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is
      inherently uncertain. Factors that could cause actual results to differ
      materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements or
      that could have a material effect on the operations and future prospects
      of the Company include, but are not limited to: (1) credit quality
      deterioration or pronounced and sustained reduction in real estate or
      other collateral values could cause an increase in the allowance for
      loan losses and a reduction in net income; (2) our management's ability
      to reduce and effectively manage interest rate risk and the impact of
      interest rates in general on the level and volatility of our net
      interest income; (3) changes in the economic environment, competition,
      or other factors that may affect our ability to acquire loans or
      influence the anticipated growth rate of loans and deposits and the
      quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing; (4)
      fluctuations in the value of our investment securities; (5) governmental
      monetary and fiscal policies; (6) legislative, regulatory and tax law
      changes as well as changes in the scope and cost of Federal Deposit
      Insurance Corporation insurance and other fees; (7) the ability to
      attract and retain key executives and employees; (8) the sufficiency of
      the allowance for loan losses to absorb the amount of actual losses
      inherent in our loan portfolio; (9) our ability to adapt successfully to
      technological changes; (10) credit risks and risks from concentrations
      (by geographic area and by industry) within our loan portfolio; (11) the
      effects of competition from numerous sources; (12) the failure of
      assumptions underlying the establishment of allowances for loan losses
      and estimation of values of collateral and various other financial
      assets and liabilities; (13) volatility, duration and matching risks of
      rate-sensitive assets and liabilities as well as liquidity risk; (14)
      operational risks, including data processing system failure or fraud;
      (15) the costs, effects and outcomes of existing or future litigation;
      (16) changes in general economic or industry conditions, nationally or
      in the communities in which we conduct business; (17) changes in
      accounting policies and practices; and (18) other risks.

HATTIESBURG, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      The First Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FBMS), holding company for The
      First, A National Banking Association, (www.thefirstbank.com)
      reported today a 56.6% increase ($1.5 million) in operating net earnings
      (net income available to common shareholders adjusted for merger related
      costs) for the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of
      2016. Operating net earnings available to common shareholders totaled
      $4.0 million for second quarter 2017 as compared to $2.6 million for
      second quarter 2016. Operating net earnings available to common
      shareholders excludes tax affected merger related expenses of $1.6
      million in the second quarter of 2017.
    

      Fully diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2017 were
      $0.26 as compared to $0.47 for the second quarter of 2016. Fully diluted
      earnings per share for the second quarter of 2017 includes one-time
      merger related charges of $0.18 and also includes the issuance of
      3,563,380 in new common shares during the fourth quarter of 2016 related
      to the capital raise in October 2016.
    

      Highlights for the Quarter:
    


        Operating net earnings (net income available to common shareholders
        adjusted for merger related costs) for the second quarter were $4.0
        million compared to $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, an
        18.6% increase.
      

        System integration for both acquisitions, which closed in the first
        quarter, was completed.
      

        Total loans increased 4.2% or $48 million during the quarter.
      

        The Company's common stock was included in the Russell 2000 Index for
        the first time.
      

        Acquisitions added loans of $239.6 million and deposits of $355.7
        million (loan and deposit figures are net of credit and rate marks)
        during the first quarter of 2017.
      


      M. Ray "Hoppy" Cole, President & Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We
      are pleased with the performance of the company during the second
      quarter. The two acquisitions closed in the first quarter have been
      fully integrated and core operating results are beginning to reflect
      significantly improved performance as a result of those acquisitions. We
      are also pleased with our organic growth across our entire footprint
      exhibited by $48 million of net loan growth for the quarter. I commend
      our team members on an outstanding quarter especially given the
      complexities and challenge of integrating two acquisitions at once."

      at March 31, 2017. Including valuation accounting adjustments on

      Second quarter 2017 noninterest expense increased $6.1 million, or 68.9%

      to higher compensation expense and one-time charges associated with the
      acquisitions. Salaries increased $2.4 million of which $1.7 million is
      the result of increased employment numbers as a result of the
      acquisitions. Other professional services and other noninterest expenses

      million and $10.1 million for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016,
      respectively. The FTE net interest income increased $5.0 million in
      prior year quarterly comparison primarily due to an increase in interest
      earned on loans. Purchase accounting adjustments accounted for $97,000
      of the difference in net interest income for the second quarter
      comparisons. Second quarter 2017 net interest margin of 3.84% includes 3
      bps related to purchase accounting adjustments.
    

      Investment securities totaled $382.0 million, or 21.3% of total assets
      at June 30, 2017, versus $258.5 million, or 21.1% of total assets at

      prior year quarterly comparison, from 4.05% for the second quarter of
      2016 to 4.25% for the second quarter of 2017. This increase was offset
      partially by an increase in average interest expense of 6 basis points

      quarter of 2017.

      Certain financial information included in the earnings release and the
      associated Condensed Consolidated Financial Information (unaudited) is
      determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP.
    

      We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they are useful for
      evaluating our financial condition with a meaningful measure for
      assessing our financial condition as well as comparison to financial
      results for prior periods. These results should not be viewed as a
      substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and are
      necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that other
      companies may use.

            07/21/17 04:05 PM EDT
        


MOUNTAIN GROVE, Mo., July 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Bancshares, Inc. (“Company”), (OTCQB:FBSI), the holding company for First Home Bank (“Bank”), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.






For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company had net income of $122,000, or $0.08 per share – diluted, compared to net income of $160,000, or $0.11 per share – diluted for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The $38,000 decrease in net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016 is attributable to an increase of $30,000 in provision for loan losses, a $23,000 increase in loss on sale of investments, a $20,000 decrease in non-interest income and a $31,000 increase in non-interest expense.  This was partially offset by an increase of $56,000 in net interest income and a $10,000 decrease in income tax expense.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, net interest income increased by $56,000, or 3.67%, to $1.58 million from $1.53 million during the same quarter in 2016.  This increase in net interest income was the result of an increase in interest income of $72,000, or 3.92% and was partially offset by an increase of $16,000, or 5.19%, in interest expense.  The increase in interest income is due to the growth in the Company’s loan portfolio.  The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in the Company’s deposit portfolio.
Provision for loan losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $30,000 compared to no provision for loan losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Provision for loan losses during the June 30, 2017 quarter is attributable to growth in the Company’s loan portfolio.  The allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2017 was $1.80 million, or 1.22% of total loans at June 30, 2017 compared to $1.71 million, or 1.25% of total loans at June 30, 2016.  Classified loans at June 30, 2017 were $1.42 million compared to $813,000 at June 30, 2016.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, the Company had a loss on sale of investments of $14,000 compared to a $9,000 gain on sale of investments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Market conditions during both quarters presented management with opportunities to continue to sell certain securities to improve the Company’s interest rate risk profile.  The Company used the proceeds from these sales to fund loans and the results are an increase in the Company’s interest income.
Non-interest income decreased by $20,000, or 8.30% to $221,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 from $241,000 for the same quarter in 2016.  The decrease was the result of a decrease of $13,000 in service charges on deposit accounts and a decrease of $7,000 in debit card and ATM fees.
Non-interest expense increased by $31,000, or 2.03%, to $1.56 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 from $1.53 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The increase in non-interest expense reflects an increase of $63,000 in professional fees consisting of legal, accounting and consulting service related expenses directly related to the upcoming merger with Stockmens Bank, Colorado Springs, CO.  This is partially offset by a decrease of $9,000 in salaries and employee benefits, a decrease of $4,000 in premises and fixed asset expenses, a decrease of $7,000 in FDIC deposit insurance premiums and a decrease of $12,000 in other non-interest expense items.
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company had net income of $174,000, or $0.11 per share – diluted, compared to net income of $319,000, or $0.21 per share – diluted for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The $145,000 decrease in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 is attributable to an increase of $90,000 in provision for loan losses, an increase of $30,000 in loss on sale of investments, a decrease of $53,000 in non-interest income and an increase of $154,000 in non-interest expense.  This is partially offset by an increase of $106,000 in net interest income and a decrease of $76,000 in income tax expense.
For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company had provision for loan losses of $90,000 compared to no provision for loan losses during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The Company’s provision for loan loss expense for 2017 is attributable to growth in the loan portfolio.
During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company had a loss on sale of investments of $23,000 compared to a gain on sale of investments of $7,000 during the same period in 2016. 
Non-interest income decreased by $53,000, or 10.73%, to $441,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $494,000 for the same period in 2016.  The decrease in non-interest income reflects a decrease of $28,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, a $16,000 decrease in debit card and ATM fees and a $14,000 decrease in the sale of repossessed assets and OREO.  This was partially offset by a $5,000 increase in other non-interest income items.
Non-interest expense increased by $154,000, or 5.11%, to $3.17 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $3.01 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The increase is attributable to professional fees consisting of legal, accounting and consulting service related expenses directly related to the upcoming merger with Stockmens Bank, Colorado Springs, CO of $159,000.  This was partially offset by a decrease of $5,000 in other non-interest expense items.
Total consolidated assets at June 30, 2017 were $227.93 million, compared to $219.48 million at December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $8.45 million, or 3.85%.  Stockholders’ equity at June 30, 2017 was $20.26 million, or 8.89% of assets, compared with $19.77 million, or 9.01% of assets at December 31, 2016.  Book value per common share increased to $13.08 at June 30, 2017 from $12.76 at December 31, 2016.  The $492,000, or 2.49% increase in stockholders’ equity was attributable to an increase in the unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of income taxes of $318,000 and by net income of $174,000 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Net loans receivable increased $8.34 million, or 6.10%, to $145.14 million at June 30, 2017 from $136.80 million at December 31, 2016.  While loan growth has been the key focus for the Company, we have continued to concentrate on maintaining high asset quality within the loan portfolio.  Nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017 were $489,000, or 0.34% of net loans, compared to $246,000 in nonperforming loans, or 0.18% of net loans at December 31, 2016.  Deposits increased $10.17 million, or 5.60% to $191.90 million at June 30, 2017 from $181.73 million at December 31, 2016.  FHLB advances decreased $2.0 million or 16.67%, to $10.00 million at June 30, 2017 from $12.0 million at December 31, 2016.
