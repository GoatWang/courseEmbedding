					Full Description



Aemetis, Inc., incorporated on October 24, 2006, is an international renewable fuels and biochemicals company. The Company is focused on the production of fuels and chemicals through the acquisition, development and commercialization of technologies that replace traditional petroleum-based products by conversion of first-generation ethanol and biodiesel plants into biorefineries. The Company's segments include North America and India. The North America segment includes the Company's 60 million gallon per year capacity ethanol manufacturing plant in Keyes, California and its technology lab in College Park, Maryland. The India segment includes the Company's over 50 million gallon per year capacity biodiesel manufacturing plant in Kakinada, the administrative offices in Hyderabad, India, and the holding companies in Nevada and Mauritius.The North America will include the Company's domestic commercial application of second generation ethanol technology, its plant construction projects and any acquisitions of ethanol or ethanol related technology facilities in North America. The Company's biodiesel is marketed and sold primarily to customers in India through brokers and by the Company directly. The Keyes plant produces its own combined heat and power (CHP) through the use of a natural gas-powered steam turbine, and reuses its process water with zero water discharge. In addition to ethanol, the Keyes plant produces Wet Distillers Grains (WDG), corn oil and Condensed Distillers Solubles (CDS), all of which are sold to local dairies and feedlots as animal feed. The Company's biodiesel production facility in Kakinada has a nameplate capacity of approximately 150,000 metric tons per year. The primary feedstock for the production of low carbon fuel ethanol at the Keyes facility is Number Two yellow dent corn. It holds interests in Zymetis, Inc., a biochemical research and development company. The Kakinada plant is capable of producing biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO), which can be supplied from China, the Middle East and other foreign markets, as well as domestic India suppliers. It produces biodiesel and refined glycerin at the Kakinada plant.The Company competes with Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, Reliance Petroleum and Essar Oil.
