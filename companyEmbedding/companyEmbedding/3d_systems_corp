History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]
Applications and industries[edit]
3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing.
Examples of industry-specific applications include:

Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts
Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling
Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development
Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing
Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies
Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives
Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc.
Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times
Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting

For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.
Facilities and employees[edit]
In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) consist of research and development laboratories with an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work.[23]
With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan[citation needed]. The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents.[24]
Community involvement and partnerships[edit]
3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing "the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures."[25]
In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards.[26]
3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy® (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort.[27]
3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build "world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness.[28]
On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.[29][30]

History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]

History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]
Applications and industries[edit]
3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing.
Examples of industry-specific applications include:

Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts
Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling
Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development
Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing
Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies
Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives
Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc.
Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times
Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting

For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.
Facilities and employees[edit]
In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) consist of research and development laboratories with an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work.[23]
With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan[citation needed]. The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents.[24]
Community involvement and partnerships[edit]
3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing "the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures."[25]
In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards.[26]
3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy® (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort.[27]
3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build "world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness.[28]
On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.[29][30]

In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]
Applications and industries[edit]
3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing.
Examples of industry-specific applications include:

Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts
Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling
Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development
Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing
Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies
Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives
Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc.
Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times
Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting

For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.
Facilities and employees[edit]
In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) consist of research and development laboratories with an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work.[23]
With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan[citation needed]. The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents.[24]
Community involvement and partnerships[edit]
3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing "the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures."[25]
In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards.[26]
3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy® (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort.[27]
3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build "world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness.[28]
On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.[29][30]

History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]

History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]
Applications and industries[edit]
3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing.
Examples of industry-specific applications include:

Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts
Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling
Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development
Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing
Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies
Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives
Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc.
Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times
Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting

For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.
Facilities and employees[edit]
In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) consist of research and development laboratories with an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work.[23]
With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan[citation needed]. The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents.[24]
Community involvement and partnerships[edit]
3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing "the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures."[25]
In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards.[26]
3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy® (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort.[27]
3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build "world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness.[28]
On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.[29][30]

It has been more than a year and I am still trying to get refund or replace for my last 10 boxes of resin cartridge.   I am so afraid to print anything now as I fear the resin cartridge leaks into the printer and I have to send for costly servicing (by the way, EYE2EYE is by far the worst distributor/reseller that I have dealt so far... they basically do not see eye to eye with their customer... it is always customer fault).  It is better to put Projet 1200 in storage than to have print failures or cartridge leaks. 展开Joe Angel Mercado · 2017年4月20日Company I work for ordered one of their dual extruder printers and of the 5 units we went through, we got 3 prints..... then after a year of troubleshooting and... frustration we get told that our warranty is done so we won't get any further help. Stay far away from this company, if their products sucked any harder you would have to give it 50 bucks in a dark alley. 展开Mario Martinez · 2017年4月17日#3DSystems is a horrible company that leaves its customers out to dry if problems arise with their products unless you keep dumping money to them. They should h...ave a class action if all the people they have burned join together. problem is they burn the little people with little funds to fight their huge legal team paid for with the monies they burned their investors on 展开Niall Quinn · 2017年1月3日I bought a 3rd generation cube for a school design department.  The printer had nothing but issues and customer support was very good at repeating the same advi...ce over and over.  Eventually support said "We are sorry for the inconvenience that the Auto-level function has caused you. It is a common issue among the Cube 3 printers"  So they know they are selling a faulty product.  This issue caused damage to the printer plate on the product which they know is an issue with the machine but wont supply a replacement plate.  They said it was sold during liquidation to the schools supply company we bought it from and this made the warranty invalid.  "The seller would have bought them from us in bulk at a very low price per unit and is now selling them on. Unfortunately one of the conditions of the liquidation sale was that the devices would not be covered by any warranty so we cannot support the replacement or repair of these devices."  Two companies getting something for cheap and the pupils are the ones who lose out. Nice 展开Murilo Serrano · 2017年6月27日Worst experience as a customer!!! 7 cartridges out of 7 clogged and unusable.. Bought from 3D Systems Brazil  and no response.. I am stuck with an worthless ext...remely expensive printer with 7 2 unusable cartridge... a total investment of almost 2kUSD totally lost!!! Deception and lack of professionalism!!! 展开Mohamed Zakaria Ali · 2017年1月28日I bought the Cube 3 3rd gen. At first I was very excited of having it and printed out some cool stuff, then start to get disappointed with the errors, clogging,... and the extruder heat messages. I've contacted the customer service 3 times already and yet no replies. I was more disappointed when I found out that there're no available parts for it in the online market! 展开Armand Michael Ouattara · 2017年5月5日the future is now....all can be rewrite in 3D for the world continuity...follow the 3d concept to easier life!!Jayson James · 2016年11月11日It's actually pretty amazing. I bought the 3rd generation cube with such excitement as my first 3d printer. It's had nothing but issues. I emailed customer supp...ort and was basically blown off in the rudest ways with no assistance. The world seems to have such a deep dislike of the company. Only way they could ever manage to repay what they do is to allow outside filament as opposed to the stock cartridge that's out of stock for weeks now. Do I expect it? Not a chance, means they couldn't suck out that last penny from customers you claim to take care of 展开Vincent Vitter · 2017年3月4日I bought a sense scanner for 400 euro, i have to registrate it before i can use it, and the registration does not work!! so now i can not use it thanks alot AHO...LES!!!  I tried to register again a while later and now it works, but i still think it sucks that i have to register my product before i can use it. 展开Germán Arias Ramos · 2017年5月11日Es una verdadera lastima leer tantos comentarios negativos sobre la marca, ya que  me interesa mucho la adquisición de la 3D 4500, tocará seguir en la busquedaChristian Ray Blackburn · 2016年9月24日I know that the 3rd generation Cube home printer is discontinued, and that people hate the cartridge system and the software but you know what?  I LOVE mine!  I... bought a Cube 3 a few months ago full knowing about it being discontinued and the cartridge cost, and it's by far and away the best printer I have ever had. The cartridges could not be easier to use, and the print jet being a part of each cartridge is genius to me. If you shop around, places like eBay and Beat Buy have the cartridges for $25 a piece all the time, both PLA and ABS and while bulk filament is less costly yes, it's almost always of dubious quality and overall dimensions.   In short, I love my printer and my iSense scanner and I'm glad to support a company based in the USA(around 100 miles away from me no less). 展开Sean Linett · 2016年8月3日i bought one of their iSense scanners for an ipad i have and the config app and the normal scanning app worked just fine....it wasnt perfect but nothing really ...ever is but i made it work. Fast forward to months later the ipad app starts telling me i have to open the configuration app so it can config the scanner....so i do. well it displays a message about not being allowed to connect to the server and that the devices were disabled. i contacted their support and got told that the app is "broken" and they have no eta on when it will be fixed. I checked the forums and saw many others complaining about this....reps told them that only devices that can provide invoices can use the config app now. so the rep that emailed me lied to me about the issue but i let that slide. I email them back saying you have to enable my device and pride the serial number for it.....they come back to me and tell me unless i provide proof that i paid $399 from them i cant activate my isense device for calibrating. they also gave me bullshit responses saying "well most customers never have to use the calibration app".....sooooo....most isnt all. its their product. sure they rebranded some other companies device but it is their device and they suddenly cut me off from using their apps unless i provide an invoice which i dont have it anymore.....it was so damn long ago and who expects them to just turn off devices from connecting to the server?  I messaged them explaining that its their product....it shouldnt be blocked from connecting to the app. thats like apple saying "well you didnt buy this iphone from us directly and if you did you cant provide proof that you did so no software updates or app store for you!". this company is complete garbage and should be avoided period!  oh and when i replied to them saying "most users" doesnt mean all users and sent a followup to that email asking for a response....well....i never heard back....go figure right? 展开Sanjay Gandhi · 2015年11月18日Hi,  I am a stockholder of 3d Systems, and also an avid fan of the technology. Am an Electrical and Metallurgical Engineer by profession, so know a bit about th...e tech side.  Have been annoyed at how the company has wasted capital over the last two years in acquisitions. With Abe gone hopefully the founder (Charles Hull) and others can focus on bringing the company back to it's engineering and technology roots-not just marketing and sales types who seemed to be running the show.  A 3d printer is a hard engineering problems, leave it to the engineers and technology folk to run the company please! The products need to work well, it is a hard thing to achieve, but worth the pain. Putting marketing and sales types in charge of hard engineering problems almost always results in failure (they are better of selling shampoo and soap).   I hope that in the next few years we will see good results from the company, without acquisitions, real technology is developed at home, you can't acquire innovation; most probably the innovation sellers are selling you crap disguised as technology.  Please forward this message to the Senior management and the board.  Thanks Sanjay Gandhi 展开David Lugton · 2015年11月16日This is seriously the worst company for customer service I have ever come across.  there are walls between you and the supplier of the products.  They don't kee...p adequate records of the software we have purchased - it can take WEEKS to upgrade.  We are locked into contracts with our CAD software [Geomagic] that is ordinary at best; but the consumer level 3D printers are a whole other level of pain.  Cubex Trio has spent more time being fixed than printing.  When it prints you have to pray hard and long to get an outcome. Unless it is a small and simple part it will be warped.  Always.  You cannot print ABS - don't even try.  You are locked into their ridiculous cassette system for the plastic - if you can find a supplier - the PLA is such poor quality that it shatters inside the feed tube and if you don't unload the machine after every use it will never be able to come out and you will need new feed tubes $US50.00 plus delivery. This machine is really a proof of concept prototype and not fit for production; certainly not the $6000.00 we paid three years ago.  We can't even sell it because everyone knows these machines are a piece of shit. We have no experience of the Projets, but based on our collective experience with 3D Systems I would want some good, strong guarantees before I let them anywhere near the place 展开Derek Bacon Nordlund · 2016年6月5日Up until i had the misfortune of having the Cube 3d second gen, I thought the worst 3d printer on the market was the makerbot replicator 5.  Technically, yes, t...he cube 3d is a 3d printer in the sense that it melts and layers plastic, but the layers are inconsistent and pull right apart when trying to take the supports off.  How can you people sell such a piece of garbage.  Well the good thing to know is that i can scrap this for parts to make a reprap.  Your products are shit. 展开Fredo Santini · 2017年1月26日I love the definition in the sand pieces! 3D Systems you are the best!Victor Miguel Fernandez · 2017年6月3日All this is a great helpful development to the future.Richard Sterling · 2015年4月17日Before you purchase a 3D systems machine question their customer service. It has taken weeks to get a reply form customer service, and even then they do not ans...wer your questions directly: Email to customer service: As I mentioned I have purchased a CubePro duo. What I couldn't find on the website or on line was the heated build plate, I found the build plate on your website but it did not specify if it was heated or not. Also I couldn't find the Spool net weight of the ABS and PLA. Also I can't find any mechanic data on any of your materials, modulus, tensile strength, 2nd stage softening point etc,etc. I have some reservations regarding the quality of the printing, if you look at the buckle at the end of this YouTube clip  it is not what I would expect. I am not concerned about the other machine as it is three times the price, but I am concerned about the quality of the print. It is not only this clip, there are many on the web. My first interest in your company was to purchase a ProJet® 3510 HD, with the interest of becoming a reseller, but as I mentioned we had trouble purchasing a machine to we got cold feet and downgraded to a CubePro Duo, well below where we had hope to enter. To compensate we are in the process of ordering a Mark One from MarkForge, with the intention of becoming a dealer. Their customer service is impeccable, emailed them via their website and they phoned with-in 15 min, answered all my questions, after we disconnected the call I received all of the information I requested. Sent a follow up email the next day. Now I am concerned we have made the wrong choice, I am only grateful that we have purchased through Amazon so we can return it. 展开Artur Tchoukanov · 2016年1月28日I am a corporate user, projet 4500 which never properly worked from the moment we got it. 3d systems doesn't do support, they pass it on to their resellers who ...are not well informed and who for the most part just ask 3d systems the same questions, and we rarely hear back answers or solutions.  Anyone is thinking class action? we have corresponded with at least 8 other companies who have a broken projet4500. 展开Ben Jordan · 2017年4月7日Geomagic Design (Alibre) has not had any updates since March 2015!全部视频Our ProJet 4500 prints passed their durability testing with flying colors -- literally! http://bit.ly/1VwhnV1

3D Printing Performance Attributes You Need To Know

File-to-Finished Part Speed
Every 3D printer has a different file-to-finished part speed, which takes into account build preparation, print speed, required post-processing, and optional finishing time.
Part Cost
In order to properly understand part cost estimates vendors give you, it’s important to know what has and has not been included to arrive at that quote. Using our Buyer’s Guide helps you deal with vendors throughout the purchasing process.
Feature Detail Resolution
Hitting the right accuracy at the first print is essential when production batches involve various size, geometries, and types of parts.
Accuracy
Accuracy claims by manufacturers are usually for specific measurement test parts and actual results will vary depending on part geometry, material shrinkage, part size and geometry, and precision and repeatability for production applications, so be sure to define your application accuracy requirements and test.
Material Properties
Understanding the intended applications and the needed material characteristics is important in selecting a 3D printer. Each technology has strengths and weaknesses that need to be factored in.
Print Capacity
Required print capacity for production is determined by a variety of criteria including the printer’s ability to make the breadth of the parts you need to create.
Color
Like 2D printing, the quality of 3D printing is dependent on resolution, the number of primary colors and processing capability per channel, and the printer’s capability of dithering. The Buyer’s Guide helps you determine what color factors are most important for your business.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.

History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]
Applications and industries[edit]
3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing.
Examples of industry-specific applications include:

Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts
Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling
Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development
Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing
Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies
Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives
Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc.
Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times
Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting

For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.
Facilities and employees[edit]
In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) consist of research and development laboratories with an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work.[23]
With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan[citation needed]. The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents.[24]
Community involvement and partnerships[edit]
3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing "the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures."[25]
In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards.[26]
3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy® (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort.[27]
3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build "world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness.[28]
On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.[29][30]

History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]
Applications and industries[edit]
3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing.
Examples of industry-specific applications include:

Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts
Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling
Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development
Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing
Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies
Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives
Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc.
Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times
Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting

For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.
Facilities and employees[edit]
In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) consist of research and development laboratories with an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work.[23]
With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan[citation needed]. The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents.[24]
Community involvement and partnerships[edit]
3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing "the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures."[25]
In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards.[26]
3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy® (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort.[27]
3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build "world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness.[28]
On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.[29][30]

History[edit]
3D Systems was founded in Valencia, California, by Chuck Hull, the inventor and patent-holder of the first stereolithography (SLA) rapid prototyping system. Prior to Hull's introduction of SLA rapid prototyping, concept models required extensive time and money to produce. The innovation of SLA reduced these resource expenditures while increasing the quality and accuracy of the resulting model. Early SLA systems were complex and costly, however, and required extensive redesign before achieving commercial viability. Primary issues concerned hydrodynamic and chemical complications. In 1996 the introduction of solid-state lasers permitted Hull and his team to reformulate their materials. Engineers in transportation, healthcare and consumer products helped fuel early phases of 3D Systems' rapid prototyping research and development. These industries remain key followers of 3D Systems' technology.
In 2003, Hull was succeeded by Avi Reichental. Both Reichental and Hull are listed among the top twenty most influential people in rapid technologies by TCT Magazine.[3] Hull remains an active member of 3D Systems' board and serves as the company's Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President.[4] 3D Systems relocated its headquarters to Rock Hill, South Carolina, citing a favorable business climate, a sustained lower cost of doing business, and significant investment and tax benefits as reasons for the move.[5]
In 2015, Reichental stepped down as the president and CEO of 3D Systems, Inc. and was replaced, on an interim basis, by the company's Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.[6]
On April 4th, 2016, the 3D Systems board appointed Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) as President and CEO.[7]
Growth[edit]
In late 2001 3D Systems began an acquisitions program that expanded the company's technology through ownership of software, materials, printers and printable content, as well as access to the skills of engineers and designers. The rate of 3D Systems' acquisitions (16 in 2011) raised some eyebrows with regard to the task facing the company's management team. Other onlookers point to the encompassing scope of the acquisitions as indicating calculated steps by 3D Systems to consolidate the 3D printing industry under one roof and logo, to become a comprehensive one-stop-shop capable of servicing each link in the scan/create-to-print chain.[8]
3D Systems now employs over 2400 people in 25 offices worldwide. Through its acquisitions, 3D Systems has achieved a strong and growing presence in Asia-Pacific (China, Korea, Japan) and Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom), in addition to expanding its brand of print materials, printers, industrial and professional CAD software, on-demand custom parts services, data capture and scanning technologies, and customizable, ready-to-print consumer collections. 3D Systems' corporate statements indicate the company's desire to facilitate user creation and "remove expert/user friction between content creation and print."[9]
In May 2011, 3D Systems transferred from NASDAQ (TDSC) to the New York Stock Exchange (DDD). Company stock has risen with general consistency since its entry to the exchange, as have company revenues and profits. In 2012, a Gray Wolf Report predicted 3D Systems' rate of growth to be unsustainable, pointing to inflated impressions from acquisitions as a corporate misstatement of organic growth. 3D Systems responded to this article on November 19, 2012, claiming it to "contain materially false statements and erroneous conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders."[10] One offending article was removed as a result. Sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report.[11]
In January 2014 it was announced that 3D Systems had acquired the Burbank, CA-based collectibles company Gentle Giant LTD.[12] Gentle Giant Ltd. designs, develops, and manufactures three-dimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition, including Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, Hellboy Animated, Disney Dragonkind, Animated Pirates of the Caribbean, Lord of the Rings, Red Star, Terminator, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Corpse Bride. Gentle Giant Ltd. produces a wide range of products including mini busts, statues, Bust-Ups, action figures, 12" figures and models. Gentle Giant Ltd.'s products are manufactured using the highest quality of polyresin, resin, plastic, PVC and ABS. Utilizing the most advanced laser-scanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans, Gentle Giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors, props, and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere.
In July 2014, 3D Systems announced an acquisition of Israeli medical imaging company Simbionix for US$120,000,000.[13]
In September 2014, 3D Systems acquired the Belgian company LayerWise. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies.[14] The company is based in Leuven, a town in Belgium close to Brussels. It is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal 3D printing and manufacturing. The company was a spin-off of the University of Leuven.[15] The takeover adds Belgium to the list of countries where 3D Systems has active locations.
In January 2015, 3D Systems acquired the 3D printer manufacturer botObjects, the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique.[16]
In April 2015, 3D Systems announced it acquired the Easyway Group of companies in China, creating 3D Systems China. Easyway is a Chinese 3D printing sales and service provider with key operations in Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, Guangdong and Chongqing.[17]
Technology[edit]
3D Systems manufactures stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) color-jet printing (CJP), fused deposition modeling (FDM), multi-jet printing (MJP) and direct metal printing (DMP). Each technology takes digital input from three-dimensional data to create three-dimensional parts through an additive, layer-by-layer process. The systems vary in their materials, print capacities and applications.

Stereolithography, or SLA, was invented by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.
Selective laser sintering, or SLS, is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together. Material options are wide, including plastic, metal, ceramic, nylon, polystrene or glass powders. In many cases, SLS is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session. SLS does not require any support structures, as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times.
Color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder. Powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer. This technology was originally developed by Z Corporation.[18]
Fused deposition modeling is handled by 3D Systems' hobbyist level printer line. These printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths, one layer at a time. A good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a 3d model. The hot glue gun (a hand powered extruder) would have to build things one layer at a time, depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice. Once a layer has cooled and hardened, the next layer can be built until the model is complete. FDM limitations include time (it must travel along complex toolpaths), color (only one color can be printed at a time), and durability (inter-layer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder). This is generally the least expensive type of printer available.
Multi-Jet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology. High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing. Unlike FDM, these parts are generally too brittle for snap-fits. However, lower durometer (softer) parts are possible with newer model MJP printers. This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.
Direct Metal Sintering refers to the 3D Systems metal printing process. This process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed, and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam. This technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications, where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed.

Products and patents[edit]
As part of 3D Systems' effort to consolidate 3D printing under one logo, its products span a range of 3D printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries. 3D Systems offers both professional and production printers. In addition to printers, 3D Systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic 3D modeling software. Following a razors and blades business model, 3D Systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers, including waxes, rubber-like materials, metals, composites, plastics and nylons.[19]
3D Systems is a closed-source company, relying on in-house innovation for product development and improvement, and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors'. Critics of the closed-source model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in 3D printing not on a lack of technology, but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry.[20] Supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higher-quality innovations, leading to a better and more impressive final product.
In November 2012, 3D Systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer 3D printer company Formlabs and the Kickstarter crowdfunding website over Formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “Simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography.”[21]
3D Systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies: the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method; radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems; compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for 3D modelers; apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering; radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems; apparatus for 3D printing using imaged layers; compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling; edge smoothness with low resolution projected images for use in solid imaging; elevator and method for tilting solid image build platform for reducing air entrapment and for build release; selective deposition modeling methods for improved support-object interface; region-based supports for parts produced by solid freeform fabrication; additive manufacturing methods for improved curl control and sidewall quality; support and build material and applications.[22]
Applications and industries[edit]
3D Systems’ products and services are used across industries to assist, either in part or in full, the design, manufacture and/or marketing processes. 3D Systems' technologies and materials are used for prototyping and the production of functional end-use parts, in addition to fast, precise design communication. Current 3D Systems-reliant industries include automotive, aerospace and defense, architecture, dental and healthcare, consumer goods and manufacturing.
Examples of industry-specific applications include:

Aerospace, for the manufacture and tooling of complex, durable and lighter-weight flight parts
Architecture, for structure verification, design review, client concept communication, reverse structure engineering, and expedited scaled modeling
Automotive, for design verification, difficult visualizations, and new engine development
Defense, for lightweight flight and surveillance parts and the reduction of inventory with on-demand printing
Dentistry, for restorations, molds and treatments. Invisalign orthodontics uses 3D Systems' technologies
Education, for equation and geometry visualizations and art schools and design initiatives
Entertainment, for the manufacture and prototyping of action figures, toys, games and game components; printing of sustainable guitars and basses, multifunction synthesizers, etc.
Healthcare, for customized hearing aids and prosthetics, improved medicine delivery methods, respiratory devices, therapeutics, and flexible endoscopy and laparoscopy devices for improved procedures and recovery times
Manufacturing, for faster product development cycles, mold production, prototypes, and design trouble-shooting

For industries such as aerospace and automotive, 3D Systems' technologies have reduced the time needed to incorporate design drafts and enabled the production of more efficient parts of lighter weight. Because 3D printing builds layer-by-layer according to design, it does not need to accommodate the traditional manufacturing tools of subtractive methods, often resulting in lighter parts and more efficient geometries.
Facilities and employees[edit]
In 2007, the company consolidated its offices, operations, and research and development functions into a new global headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina, US. About half of the headquarters’ 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) consist of research and development laboratories with an 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) Rapid Manufacturing Center (RMC) with 3D Systems’ rapid prototyping, rapid manufacturing and 3D printing systems at work.[23]
With customers in 80 countries, 3D Systems has over 2100 employees in 25 worldwide locations, including San Francisco, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, China, Korea and Japan[citation needed]. The company has more than 359 U.S. and foreign patents.[24]
Community involvement and partnerships[edit]
3D Systems is involved in a multi-year agreement with the Smithsonian Institution as part of a Smithsonian-wide effort to strengthen collections' stewardship and increase collection accessibility through 3D representations. This partnership is part of the company's attempt to broadcast the capabilities and applications of 3D printing while increasing "the visibility and accessibility of our national treasures."[25]
In 2012, 3D Systems began partnering with the 90-year-old Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the Future New category. For this branch of the Scholastic Awards, students will be challenged to express bold and innovative ideas using new technologies. 3D Systems will offer students free 3D design software to facilitate their creations and will award three winners with a $1000 scholarship. This money is in addition to the prizes and recognition granted winners by the Scholastic Awards.[26]
3D Systems is a corporate underwriter of the National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's ToothFairy® (NCOHF). NCOHF provides community programs to deliver educational, preventative and treatment oral health services to children in at-risk populations. 3D Systems contributes its 3D content-to-print solutions and Cubify capabilities to the NCOHF effort.[27]
3D Systems has contributed two production-grade 3D printers to the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, Ohio, the first center of a federal initiative to enhance the competitiveness of US industry. The Youngstown institute is just one regional hub of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), which aspires to build "world-class centers for applied research, technology incubation and commercialization" to re-localize manufacturing and strengthen US competitiveness.[28]
On February 18 of 2014, Ekso Bionics debuted the first ever 3D printed hybrid exoskeleton robotic suit, in collaboration with 3D Systems.[29][30]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
