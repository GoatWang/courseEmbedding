What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.

Current operations[edit]
Its operation areas include 46% in California, 23% in the Permian Basin, and 13% in the Uintah Basin.
History[edit]
Berry Petroleum Company first started its exploration in 1909 in California.
In August 1996, Berry Petroleum agreed to buy Tannehill Oil and its affiliates for $25.2 million.[1]
In 2003, Berry acquired properties in the Uintah Basin in northwestern Utah.[2]
In February 2013, Linn Energy acquired Berry Petroleum Company for $4.3 billion, including $2.5 billion in stock.[3][4]
In February 2017, Linn Energy completed a financial restructure that included the corporate spin-off of Berry into a separate company with separate ownership.[5]
1993 Oil spill[edit]
In December 1993, an oil pipeline owned by Berry Petroleum leaked, resulting in a spill of 84,000 gallons of heavy crude oil into McGrath Lake, near Oxnard, California. Berry had acquired the 40-year-old pipeline from Chevron in 1990 after it had been abandoned for 10 years. The line had been used to transport natural gas, yet Berry began to pump crude oil through it without making any upgrades. Moreover, it was revealed that 10 months before the oil spill occurred, a safety valve that might have prevented the leak had broken and was not repaired. Both Berry and the state negotiated through the press, with Berry countering prosecutors threats with talk of suing the agencies that neglected to investigate witness reports and notify company officials of the leak. Several months later Berry agreed to pay a $600,000 settlement and pleaded no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to report the leak. In addition, the foreman on duty during the spill pleaded no contest to a charge of illegally releasing oil into marine water and was ordered to perform 320 hours of beach cleanup. Although free of criminal charges, Berry still faced a civil case from the state attorney general's office. That matter was not to be settled until January 1997, when the company agreed to a $3.2 million fine.[6][7][8][9]

Current operations[edit]
Its operation areas include 46% in California, 23% in the Permian Basin, and 13% in the Uintah Basin.
History[edit]
Berry Petroleum Company first started its exploration in 1909 in California.
In August 1996, Berry Petroleum agreed to buy Tannehill Oil and its affiliates for $25.2 million.[1]
In 2003, Berry acquired properties in the Uintah Basin in northwestern Utah.[2]
In February 2013, Linn Energy acquired Berry Petroleum Company for $4.3 billion, including $2.5 billion in stock.[3][4]
In February 2017, Linn Energy completed a financial restructure that included the corporate spin-off of Berry into a separate company with separate ownership.[5]
1993 Oil spill[edit]
In December 1993, an oil pipeline owned by Berry Petroleum leaked, resulting in a spill of 84,000 gallons of heavy crude oil into McGrath Lake, near Oxnard, California. Berry had acquired the 40-year-old pipeline from Chevron in 1990 after it had been abandoned for 10 years. The line had been used to transport natural gas, yet Berry began to pump crude oil through it without making any upgrades. Moreover, it was revealed that 10 months before the oil spill occurred, a safety valve that might have prevented the leak had broken and was not repaired. Both Berry and the state negotiated through the press, with Berry countering prosecutors threats with talk of suing the agencies that neglected to investigate witness reports and notify company officials of the leak. Several months later Berry agreed to pay a $600,000 settlement and pleaded no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to report the leak. In addition, the foreman on duty during the spill pleaded no contest to a charge of illegally releasing oil into marine water and was ordered to perform 320 hours of beach cleanup. Although free of criminal charges, Berry still faced a civil case from the state attorney general's office. That matter was not to be settled until January 1997, when the company agreed to a $3.2 million fine.[6][7][8][9]

Culture
Berry’s culture is reminiscent of a time when it wasn’t unusual for employees to work their whole life for one company. One where trust, honesty and fair dealing are a way of life. It’s a culture of balance that recognizes the need for productivity, creativity, and downtime away from work. The Company fosters an entrepreneurial spirit and encourages its teams to apply improvements at every level, moving the Company forward. Berry’s employees belong to the communities where they work, so the Company’s interests are aligned with those who live near operations. Berry expects to have a positive presence in the communities surrounding its operations.












History
Berry Petroleum’s roots reach back to 1909, through its predecessor companies founded by C.J. Berry. But today’s Company is a new and different Berry with new ownership and management.
More than 100 years ago a man named C.J. Berry, armed with determination and not much else, set out on a journey to seek his fortune. That path would lead from the gold claims of the Klondike to the oil fields of central California. His success was manifold and one lasting result is Berry Petroleum Company, a California-based energy company that began when C.J. began producing heavy oil from the San Joaquin basin in 1909.
Settling on a piece of land in the Southern San Joaquin Valley, nestled up against the Temblor Range, C.J. began to drill for oil. He started many oil companies as early as 1899 with names like Bakersfield Fuel Oil, El Dorado Oil Company and Mammoth Oil Company. One of his early wells was drilled on some land named for his wife, Ethel D, in 1909. Some 100 plus years later the Ethel D property is still producing oil in paying quantities.
Berry Holding Company, formed in 1916 as one of C.J.’s many companies, continued to grow over the years and in December 1985 was merged with several related entities into Berry Petroleum Company. Berry, with a very solid beginning, has continued to grow and evolve and today is one of the few remaining independent producers headquartered in California.
Berry expanded its presence in areas outside of California beginning in 2003 as opportunities to acquire light oil and natural gas became available to grow its portfolio. Today, Berry has production in five states, and is always looking for acquisitions to continue the course of success and growth that C.J. envisioned when he drilled his first well on the Ethel D lease.
LINN Energy and LinnCo acquired Berry in 2013 and subsequently LINN filed for bankruptcy in May 2016. Berry emerged from the bankruptcy as a stand-alone company on Feb 28, 2017. Berry Petroleum Company, LLC is now an independent wholly-owned subsidiary of Berry Petroleum Corporation.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.
