Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. completes registration with SEC, becomes a Public Reporting Company






























Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. completes registration with SEC, becomes a Public Reporting Company


SAN DIEGO, CA - 01/04/2017 (PRESS RELEASE JET) — On December 27, 2016, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective the Registration Statement on Form S-1
(No. 333-209488) of Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. (“Guardion” or the “Company”). Accordingly, Guardion is now a public reporting company.
Michael Favish, the founder and CEO of Guardion, commented, “This news brings to a close a year of accomplishment for Guardion. We received recognition in several highly
respected ocular health publications. Our trademark registrations have been issued for Guardion®, MapcatSF® and Lumega-Z®. On November 8, 2016, the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office issued patent number 9,486,136 for our MapcatSF® medical device.” Mr. Favish continued, “In the upcoming year, we intend to begin the evaluation of
potential acquisitions of synergistic and ‘value added’ technologies that may be interested in becoming part of a public company. We will seek to continue to raise new
capital through the sale of our equity securities to fund our operations. We also intend to take steps in 2017 to create a public market for our stock, and we are continuing to
interview prospective market makers.”
Mr. Favish concluded, “Our focus will be on age-related eye disease and vision performance in 2017. We believe that Guardion is poised for significant growth, as we
continue to address the growing need for early detection and intervention with respect to age-related macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. With the combination of
our existing intellectual property portfolio, and strategically selected additional technologies, Guardion is well-positioned to achieve its immediate and longer term
objectives.”
This press release does not constitute an offer of our securities for sale, which can only be made by means of definitive offering documents.
For information regarding investment opportunities, or for interested industry parties, please contact Vincent Roth, General Counsel, at vroth@guardionhealth.com or (858)
605-9055 Ext 208.

Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. completes registration with SEC, becomes a Public Reporting Company
San Diego, California – January 3, 2017 – On December 27, 2016, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-209488) of Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. (“Guardion” or the “Company”). Accordingly, Guardion is now a public reporting company.
Michael Favish, the founder and CEO of Guardion, commented, “This news brings to a close a year of accomplishment for Guardion. We received recognition in several highly respected ocular health publications. Our trademark registrations have been issued for Guardion®, MapcatSF® and Lumega-Z®. On November 8, 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued patent number 9,486,136 for our MapcatSF® medical device.”
Mr. Favish continued, “In the upcoming year, we intend to begin the evaluation of potential acquisitions of synergistic and ‘value added’ technologies that may be interested in becoming part of a public company. We will seek to continue to raise new capital through the sale of our equity securities to fund our operations. We also intend to take steps in 2017 to create a public market for our stock, and we are continuing to interview prospective market makers.”
Mr. Favish concluded, “Our focus will be on age-related eye disease and vision performance in 2017. We believe that Guardion is poised for significant growth, as we continue to address the growing need for early detection and intervention with respect to age-related macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. With the combination of our existing intellectual property portfolio, and strategically selected additional 564505v.2 technologies, Guardion is well-positioned to achieve its immediate and longer term objectives.”
This press release does not constitute an offer of our securities for sale, which can only be made by means of definitive offering documents. For information regarding investment opportunities, or for interested industry parties, please contact Vincent Roth, General Counsel, at vroth@guardionhealth.com or (858) 605-9055 Ext 208.
