                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and  ? changes in medical treatment or reimbursement rates or utilization for our anatomic and clinical pathology markets;  ? changes in payor regulations, policies or payor mix;  ? changes in regulation or regulatory policies;  ? competition for our diagnostic services, including the internalization of testing functions and technologies by our clients;  ? the failure to successfully collect for our services;  ? payor efforts to reduce utilization and reimbursement rates;  ? changes in product mix;  ? failure to successfully integrate or fully realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions within the expected time frames;  ? the discovery of unknown or contingent liabilities from acquired businesses;  ? the failure of our acquired assets to generate the level of expected returns;  ? disruptions or failures of our IT solutions or infrastructure;  ? the failure to adequately safeguard data;  ? loss of key executives, pathologists and technical personnel;  ? growth in demand for our services that exceeds our ability to adequately scale our infrastructure;  ? a decline in our rate of strategic or organic growth;  ? the loss of in-network status, with or our inability to collect from, health care insurers;  ? the availability of additional capital resources;  ? increased competition in our industry or the failure to maintain relationships with clients, including referring physicians and hospitals, and with payors;  ? the protection of our intellectual property;  ? general economic, business or regulatory conditions affecting the health care and diagnostic testing services industries;  ? the introduction of new or failure of old technologies, products or tests;  ? federal or state health care reform initiatives;  ? violation of, failure to comply with, or changes in federal and state laws and regulations related to, submission of claims for our services, fraud and abuse, patient privacy, corporate practice of medicine, billing arrangements for our services and environmental, health and safety;  ? attainment of licenses required to test patient specimens from certain states or the loss or suspension of licenses;  ? our inability to obtain liability insurance coverage or claims for damages in excess of our coverage;  ? future increases in liability insurance coverage;  - 23 -  ? our substantial level of indebtedness and ability to incur substantially more debt;  ? covenants in our debt agreements; and  ? the other risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report and in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.  Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time-to-time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Quarterly Report may not occur, and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.  You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or changes in our expectations, unless otherwise required by law.  General  We are a specialized diagnostics company providing services that play a key role in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. Our experienced pathologists deliver comprehensive diagnostic reports of a patient's condition and consult frequently with referring physicians to help determine the appropriate treatment. Our diagnostic reports often enable the early detection of disease, allowing referring physicians to make informed and timely treatment decisions that improve their patients' health in a cost-effective manner. Through our pathologist-operated laboratory practices, we provide physician-based general anatomic and clinical pathology, dermatopathology, molecular diagnostic services and other esoteric testing services to physicians, hospitals, clinical laboratories and surgery centers. Our operations consist of one reportable segment.  Emerging Growth Company  We qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we are subject to reduced reporting and other obligations generally applicable to public companies, including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies.  The information that we provide may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies due to these reduced reporting burdens.  - 24 -  Recent Developments  Health Care Regulatory and Reimbursement Changes  In the 2014 Final Physician Fee Schedule Rule CMS calculated the 2014 conversion factor using the Sustainable Growth Rate method, or SGR. The new conversion factor for 2014 represented a 20.1 percent reduction from the 2013 conversion factor. On December 18, 2013, Congress passed legislation that enacted a 0.5 percent increase in the conversion factor, which was effective through March 31, 2014. On April 1, 2014, President Obama signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA. PAMA extended the 0.5 percent increase through March 31, 2015 and made other changes to laboratory reimbursement discussed below.  On April 16, 2015 President Obama signed the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), which had previously been passed by both houses of Congress. MACRA repealed the provisions related to the Medicare SGR formula and implements a new physician payment system that is designed to reward the quality of care. In addition, it extends the current Medicare Physician Fee Schedule rates through June 2015, and then increases them by 0.5 percent for the remainder of 2015. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the rates will be increased annually by 0.5 percent, through 2019. For 2020 through 2025 payments will be frozen, although payment will be adjusted to account for performance on certain quality metrics under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment Systems (MIPS) or to reflect physician participation in alternative payment models (APMs). For 2026 and subsequent years, qualified APM participants receive an annual 0.75% update on Medicare physician payment rates, while those not participating receive a 0.25% annual payment update, plus any applicable MIPS-based payment adjustments. At this time, it is too early to determine how these changes may impact our business beyond 2015.  In the 2014 Physician Fee Schedule Rule, CMS also changed CPT codes for certain stains we commonly use and reduced the RVUs related to those codes. These changes, as well as other limits on other commonly-used CPT codes, resulted in decreased Medicare reimbursement for some of our services. We estimated the changes to the 2014 Physician Fee Schedule resulted in a reduction of our annualized Medicare revenue of approximately $3 million. We have experienced isolated reductions in reimbursement from non-governmental third-party payors tied to the Medicare reductions. However, at this time we are unable to predict the extent to which non-governmental third-party payors will seek to reduce our reimbursement rates as a result of reductions in Medicare's Physician Fee Schedule.  In the 2015 Physician Fee Rule, CMS enacted additional payment changes. Although it had indicated previously that it considered flow cytometry, a test that we commonly bill, to be potentially misvalued and therefore, overpaid, CMS did not change the payment for that code in the Final Rule. CMS did, however, change how it pays for prostate biopsy codes, which is also a test that we bill relatively often, and stated that it did consider that code to be potentially misvalued. In addition, it made substantial reductions in certain other codes, including the codes applicable to FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), which we also bill; however, our analysis suggests that those cuts will be offset by the increases in other codes, including CPT 88305, which is the most common code that we bill. CMS also stated that it does not intend to implement the policy that it proposed in the 2014 Proposed Fee Schedule Rule that would have limited certain physician payments to the amounts paid in the hospital setting. Finally, CMS announced that it is withdrawing its authority to amend laboratory rates to reflect technological changes as mandated by PAMA. Overall, based on our historical product mix we expect the changes to have a net positive impact of about $700,000 on our 2015 revenues. However, our product mix payor mix and volume may change and the actual impact of the changes to the 2015 Physician Fee Rule may vary significantly from our estimates. This does not reflect any potential change that Congress might make in the future with regard to the conversion factor.  - 25 -  Results of Operations The following table outlines our results of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Operating costs and expenses: Cost of services 56.9 % 55.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 26.6 % 26.6 % Provision for doubtful accounts 7.2 % 6.5 % Intangible asset amortization expense 7.9 % 7.8 % Management fees 1.0 % 1.0 % Acquisition and business development costs 0.1 % 0.2 % Change in fair value of contingent consideration 0.5 % 0.5 % Total operating costs and expenses 100.3 % 98.3 % Income (loss) from operations -0.3 % 1.7 % Other income (expense): Interest expense -16.5 % -14.7 % Other income / (expense) 0.0 % 0.0 % Total other expense, net -16.5 % -14.7 % Loss before income taxes -16.8 % -13.0 % Income tax benefit -1.0 % -1.5 % Net Loss -15.8 % -11.5 %  Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 and 2014  Net revenue  Net revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 was $59.5 million on accession volume of 480,000, inclusive of $2.8 million of revenue and 25,000 accessions from labs acquired in 2014. Net revenue at existing labs decreased by 0.7 percent, or approximately $0.3 million, to approximately $56.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to $57.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. Same lab accession volume decreased by 1.4 percent to 454,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to 461,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, primarily related to client attrition. The decrease in volume for the quarter resulted in approximately $0.9 million lower net revenue. The average revenue per accession for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 increased by approximately 1.0%, to $125 for our existing labs, from approximately $124 in the quarter ended March 31, 2014, representing an increase of approximately $0.6 million in revenue. The increase in average revenue per accession and corresponding net revenue compared to the same quarter in 2014 was due primarily to changes in payor and product mix, approximately $0.2 million higher revenue from the Aurora Research Institute, which specializes in providing paraffin blocks and fresh tissue to pharmaceutical and research companies conducting research studies, and higher revenue from Medicare.  We have estimated the changes to the 2015 Physician Fee Schedule represent an increase to our annualized Medicare revenue of approximately $0.7 million. Furthermore, our average revenue per accession fluctuates as a result of changes in service mix, including the conversion of global fee arrangements to technical component (TC) or professional component (PC) arrangements and changes in test volume for women's health pathology services and clinical tests. Women's health services and clinical tests generally have lower revenue per accession and, therefore, may further decrease our average revenue per accession. Conversely, a higher volume of molecular testing may increase our average revenue per accession. In addition, our growth rates and average revenue per accession may be positively or negatively impacted by the reimbursement market and our service mix.  - 26 -  Effective January, 1, 2015, we adjusted the way we count our accession volume to better reflect our revenue per accession. Accession counts for all prior periods have been revised to reflect our current methodology.  Cost of services  Cost of services for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 was $33.8 million, including $1.8 million for labs acquired in 2014. Cost of services at existing labs increased approximately $0.3 million, or 1.0 percent, to $32.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, from $31.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, primarily as a result of higher payroll for physicians and other healthcare professionals, tech processing and lab supplies costs partially offset by lower medical liability expense.  As a percentage of net revenue, cost of services was 56.9 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to 55.7 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. Gross margin was 43.1 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to 44.3 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. Cost of services and our related gross profit percentages may be positively or negatively impacted by market conditions and our service mix.  To better reflect their correlation to revenue, certain expenses in 2014 have been reclassified from selling, general and administrative to cost of services.  Selling, general and administrative expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $0.6 million, or 3.9 percent, to $15.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 from $15.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. Compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, selling, general and administrative expenses at corporate increased by approximately $0.1 million primarily due to travel expenses for management meetings held during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, partially offset by lower insurance costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses at our labs for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2014, increased by approximately $0.5 million related to the operation of labs acquired in 2014.  As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 26.6 percent for the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014.  Provision for doubtful accounts  Our provision for doubtful accounts increased approximately $0.6 million, or 15.6 percent, to $4.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, from $3.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. As a percentage of net revenue, the provision for doubtful accounts increased to 7.2 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to 6.5 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts corresponds to an increased proportion of our accounts receivable from patients.  The Company's consolidated provision for doubtful accounts could be positively or negatively impacted by various factors including, among other things, changes in payor mix and the provision for doubtful accounts for laboratories that we acquire.  Intangible asset amortization expense  Amortization expense increased to $4.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, from $4.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, as a result of amortization of finite lived intangible assets recorded in 2014 acquisitions. We generally amortize our intangible assets over lives ranging from 3 to 15 years.  Management fees  Management fees were approximately $0.6 million for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Management fees are based on 1.0 percent of net revenue plus expenses.  Acquisition and business development costs  Transaction costs associated with our completed acquisitions and business development costs related to our prospecting and acquisition activity was approximately $0.1 million for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014.  - 27 -  Change in fair value of contingent consideration  For each of the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014 we recorded non-cash expense of $0.3 million for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration issued in connection with our acquisitions. The change in fair value of contingent consideration results from revisions in our projections to reflect recent results, as well as other variables such as the discount rate, the valuation date and actual payments made.  Interest expense  Interest expense increased by approximately $1.4 million, to $9.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to $8.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The increase in interest expense resulted from approximately $39 million higher average debt balances as well as the higher interest rates applicable under our new credit facility entered into on July 31, 2014.  Provision for income taxes  We are a Delaware limited liability company for federal and state income tax purposes, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, we generally have not been subject to income taxes, and the income attributable to us has been allocated to the members of Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC in accordance with the terms of the Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement. However, certain of our subsidiaries are structured as corporations and therefore are subject to federal and state income taxes. The benefit from federal and state income taxes for these subsidiaries, as reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements, amounted to $0.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, compared to $0.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Since inception, we have primarily financed operations through capital contributions from our equityholders, long term debt financing and cash flow from operations. We require significant cash flow to service our debt obligations. The reductions in Medicare reimbursement for 2013 and 2014, and the corresponding reduction in reimbursement from non-governmental payors, have had a significant negative impact on our cash flows. As of March 31, 2015, we had $30.0 million available under our revolving credit facility for general operations. Our management believes our cash and cash equivalents, together with cash from operations and the amount available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through 2015. In order to access the amounts available under our revolving credit facility, we must meet the financial tests and ratios contained in our senior secured credit facility. Our management currently expects to meet these financial tests and ratios at least through the end of 2015. We may undertake acquisitions which our management believes would add to earnings and performance with respect to the credit facility covenants. Nonetheless, we may not achieve all of our business goals and objectives and events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these financial tests and ratios and limit our ability to access the amounts otherwise available under our revolving credit facility.  On December 20, 2010, we issued $200.0 million in unsecured senior notes that mature on January 15, 2018, which we refer to as the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 10.75 percent, which is payable each January 15 and July 15. In accordance with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, we are subject to certain limitations on issuing additional debt and are required to submit quarterly and annual financial reports to the holders of our Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are currently redeemable at our option at 105.375 percent of par, plus accrued interest. The redemption price decreases to 102.688 percent of par on January 15, 2016 and to 100 percent of par on January 15, 2017. The Senior Notes rank equally in right of repayment with all of our other senior indebtedness but are subordinated to our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness.  On July 31, 2014 we entered into a new $220.0 million credit facility with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, which we refer to as the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility included a $165.0 million initial term loan, $30.0 million revolving credit line and $25.0 million delayed draw term loan. The delayed draw term loan facility is available through July 31, 2015 to pay the consideration for acquisitions, as permitted under the New Credit Facility, including acquisition related fees and expenses.  - 28 -  Each of the term loan, revolving credit line and delayed draw term loan under the New Credit Facility has a maturity of five years but is subject to a maturity date of October 14, 2017 if our Senior Notes are not refinanced or their maturity is not extended prior to such date. Under the outstanding term loans, quarterly principal repayments of $0.5 million are due commencing on September 30, 2015 through December 31, 2016. Quarterly principal repayments increase to $0.9 million on March 31, 2017 through June 30, 2018 and to $1.3 million on September 30, 2018 and each quarter end thereafter, with the balance due at maturity. As of March 31, 2015, the balance outstanding under the term loan facility was $165.0 million and the balance outstanding under the delayed draw term loan facility was $9.7 million. As of March 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding and we had $30.0 million available under our revolving credit facility.  The proceeds under the New Credit Facility were reduced by discounts of $5.1 million. We used $145.6 million of the $165.0 million proceeds to retire then outstanding revolving credit facility due May 2015 and term loan facility due May 2016, including accrued interest and fees. Additionally, we used $3.9 million of the proceeds to pay issuance costs in connection with the New Credit Facility. The remaining $10.4 million balance of the proceeds under the New Credit Facility initial term loan and the funds available under the $30.0 million revolving credit line are intended to be used to execute future acquisitions and for the Company's general working capital and operational needs.  Prior to the second amendment executed on April 10, 2015 discussed below, at our option, interest under the New Credit Facility was LIBOR, with a 1.25% floor, plus 7%, or at a base rate, with a 2.25% floor, plus 6%. The New Credit Facility is secured by essentially all of our assets and unconditionally guaranteed by us and certain of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and is subject to certain financial covenants.  The New Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain levels of liquidity and comply on a quarterly basis with certain financial covenants, including a leverage ratio calculation, which generally becomes more restrictive over time, and an interest coverage ratio. Also, on an annual basis we must not exceed a specified maximum amount of consolidated capital expenditures. In addition, the New Credit Facility includes negative covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things, incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees; incur liens and engage in sale leaseback . . .

Aurora Diagnostics Enters into a Seventh Amendment to Financing Agreement
Apr 25 17
On April 20, 2017, Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC, as guarantor, its subsidiary Aurora Diagnostics, LLC, as borrower, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, entered into a seventh amendment to the Financing Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2014 with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Seventh Amendment amended the definition of Final Maturity Date to modify the provision that accelerated the maturity date of the Financing Agreement to October 14, 2017 in the event that any of the Company's 10.750% Senior Notes due 2018 had not been refinanced prior to such date. As amended, the maturity of the Financing Agreement will be accelerated to October 14, 2017 only in the event that the maturity of more than $2.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes has not been extended to October 31, 2019 or a later date on or before October 14, 2017. In addition, pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, the lenders thereunder consented to the Company redeeming, repurchasing or paying at maturity up to $2.6 million of Existing Notes at any time and from time to time within eight months of the consummation of the Company's Exchange Offer.


Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC and Aurora Diagnostics, LLC Enters into Sixth Amendment to the Financing Agreement
Mar 31 17
On March 27, 2017, Aurora Diagnostics Holdings, LLC (the Company"), its subsidiary Aurora Diagnostics, LLC, as borrower, and certain other subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, entered into a sixth amendment to the Financing Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2014 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Financing Agreement") with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The sixth amendment amends the definition of Permitted Acquisition" under the Financing Agreement to permit the company to consummate certain additional acquisitions upon the payment of a $225,000 consent fee. The sixth amendment provides a 60 day extension to the Company's obligation to deliver its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 pursuant to the Financing Agreement. In connection with the extension, the sixth amendment provides that, beginning on April 1, 2017 until the date on which the financial statements have been delivered, the Applicable Margin shall increase to 7.125%, in the case of Reference Rate Loans, and 8.125%, in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans. The company intends to deliver its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 on March 31, 2017, and therefore, does not expect an increase in the Applicable Margin.
