FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Do I Need a Maritime Lawyer?









The Basics Of Maritime Injury Law





The Jones Act
The Jones Act, also known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, provides certain legal rights to seaman that protect their health and livelihood. Under the Jones Act, a seaman who has been injured would have the ability to pursue a case against the ship owner, captain, or other members of their crew. The law, however, is strict on who qualifies as a Jones Act seaman and who is eligible to recover compensation. It is therefore crucial that you talk to lawyers about your case.





Longshore & Harbor Workers' Compensation Act
Commonly referred to as the Longshore Act or LHWCA, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is a statutory workers' compensation scheme enacted in 1927 to provide protection to maritime workers who are not protected by the Jones Act. Currently, the LHWCA provides benefits to more than 500,000 workers for work-related injuries and occupational diseases. This act also provides benefits to the widow, widower, or eligible survivors if an injury or illness leads to a death.





Death on the High Seas Act
In 1920, the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) was enacted by Congress to protect the families of seaman injured while working offshore. Under this law, spouses, children, and other dependents are given the ability to pursue legal action if the loss of their loved one could be linked to the negligence of another. For example, family could pursue a claim if the accident was caused by the unseaworthiness of a vessel or careless actions of an employer or crewmember.





General Maritime Law
Maritime law is often categorized into two types. The first is the compilation of federal statutes passed over the years (such as the Jones Act); the second is vaguer and consists of "common law," which has developed naturally by major court decisions. One major component of general maritime law is the doctrine of "maintenance and cure," which is what provides living expenses, lost wages, and medical care to seamen if they become injured or ill while working offshore.











Involving a Maritime Accident Attorney from Arnold & Itkin

	Maritime law is a highly-complex area of the law—and not every statute
	 will apply to every case. For this reason, it is crucial that no time
	 is wasted in contacting a maritime injury lawyer who will be able to provide
	 you access to a wealth of knowledge. If you or someone you love has been
	 hurt, we encourage you to contact our team today. We proudly serve clients
	 throughout the Gulf, including
	Texas,
	Louisiana,
	Mississippi, and
	Alabama.

Arnold & Itkin is proud to offer a confidential and free consultation.





				What is it Like To Work
				With Arnold & Itkin







Arnold & Itkin represented nearly a third of the crewmembers injured
				 in the Deepwater Horizon explosion.




					I encountered professionalism, understanding, compassion… lot of compassion.
					 They really felt for what me and my wife were going through.
				
~ Deepwater Horizon Crew Member










Work with a lawyer who truly understands Maritime Law.
Because maritime law is so complex and so complicated, it is crucial that
					 you work with an attorney who has an in-depth understanding of how it
					 works and who has proven themselves in similar cases before.

Currently, the LHWCA provides benefits to more than 500,000 workers for work-related injuries and occupational diseases. This act also provides benefits to the widow, widower, or eligible survivors if an injury or illness leads to a death.





Death on the High Seas Act
In 1920, the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) was enacted by Congress to protect the families of seaman injured while working offshore. Under this law, spouses, children, and other dependents are given the ability to pursue legal action if the loss of their loved one could be linked to the negligence of another. For example, family could pursue a claim if the accident was caused by the unseaworthiness of a vessel or careless actions of an employer or crewmember.





General Maritime Law
Maritime law is often categorized into two types. The first is the compilation of federal statutes passed over the years (such as the Jones Act); the second is vaguer and consists of "common law," which has developed naturally by major court decisions. One major component of general maritime law is the doctrine of "maintenance and cure," which is what provides living expenses, lost wages, and medical care to seamen if they become injured or ill while working offshore.

Protecting the Victims of Maritime Injuries
Often referred to as admiralty law, maritime law is a body of U.S. laws
		 and regulations that govern offshore activities in navigable waters or
		 in the open sea. Activities that are traditionally governed by maritime
		 law include carriage of goods, marine salvaging, injuries to passengers
		 / workers, and more. Perhaps one of the most important accepts of maritime
		 injury law is the rights that it affords to offshore workers who have
		 suffered injury or illness during the course of their work—including
		 the right to recover just financial compensation. Our law firm can help
		 you in the recovery of that compensation.

The Basics Of Maritime Injury Law





The Jones Act
The Jones Act, also known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, provides certain legal rights to seaman that protect their health and livelihood. Under the Jones Act, a seaman who has been injured would have the ability to pursue a case against the ship owner, captain, or other members of their crew. The law, however, is strict on who qualifies as a Jones Act seaman and who is eligible to recover compensation. It is therefore crucial that you talk to lawyers about your case.





Longshore & Harbor Workers' Compensation Act
Commonly referred to as the Longshore Act or LHWCA, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is a statutory workers' compensation scheme enacted in 1927 to provide protection to maritime workers who are not protected by the Jones Act. Currently, the LHWCA provides benefits to more than 500,000 workers for work-related injuries and occupational diseases. This act also provides benefits to the widow, widower, or eligible survivors if an injury or illness leads to a death.

$171 Million Settlement Secured for Plant Explosion Victims
Arnold & Itkin spent years preparing and fighting for a case that resulted in a record-setting settlement.

Our team took on a case that other law firms turned down, knowing that
	 we had the resources and patience to obtain justice for our clients. The
	 case involved a serious plant explosion. Our legal team proved us right—after
	 years of preparation, hundreds of depositions, and multiple appeals, our

Arnold & Itkin Secures $117M Verdict for Accident Victim
The victim of an ambulance accident was able to receive $117 million in a verdict after the firm proved negligence on behalf of the driver.

The firm is proud to announce the recent successful verdict that they won on behalf of their client, the victim of an ambulance accident. The plaintiff was seven months pregnant at the time of the accident (December 2010) when she was experiencing stomach pains and called for an ambulance. Acadian Ambulances picked her up a short time later to transport her to the hospital. What the woman didn't know and what Arnold & Itkin later proved was that the driver had a poor driving history and bad vision as well. While the ambulance was en route to the hospital, the driver dropped something on the floor and proceeded to pick it up. He took his eyes completely off of the road and did not slow down. As a result, the ambulance collided with the back of a sugar cane truck. The woman suffered a severed spine and serious brain injuries as a result. She will never be able to walk again, and is permanently confined to the wheelchair. Also incredibly unfortunate is that her baby was born prematurely. Our client's baby and her other daughter were forced to live with the client's mother because she could no longer care for them with her disability. At the time the verdict was reached, the woman had already had to spend $1.4 million in medical bills. Throughout the course of the rest of her life, her medical bills are estimated to reach $30 million. The $117 million verdict is going toward the medical bills for the mother as well as all possible medical treatments needed for the premature child, as health complications may arise. Part of the verdict was also because the plaintiff's two children will not be able to have a healthy mother who can take care of them, and the pain and suffering that the mother sustained in addition to her physical wounds.
Attorney's fees and expenses totaled $0.00.

$76.6 Million Verdict Secured in Risperdal Case Against Johnson & Johnson
The team at Arnold & Itkin was successful in obtaining a massive $76.6 million verdict for a boy who suffered gynecomastia due to Risperdal, a Johnson & Johnson drug.

Attorneys Jason Itkin, Ces Tavares, and Kyle Findley of Arnold & Itkin
	 won an impressive $76.6 million jury verdict on behalf of a boy who suffered
	 gynecomastia, or irregular female breast growth. The verdict came against
	 Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceutical for their drug, Risperdal.
	 The team was also assisted by Cory Itkin and Santana McMurrey from the
	 firm. Both Jason and Kyle provided representation for the boy’s
	 family, bringing a lawsuit against J&J for failing to provide a proper
	 warning that their antipsychotic medicine, Risperdal, could lead to the
	 development of female breasts. This verdict will help ensure that J&J
	 is held accountable for causing such devastating disfigurement to Arnold
	 & Itkin’s client.
J&J and Janssen Pharmaceuticals tried to argue that because their drug
	 was the only drug that worked for the boy, he continued to stay on the
	 drug—even though he was informed of the potential risks. They also
	 tried to argue that Risperdal does not even cause gynecomastia, despite
	 significant evidence that shows otherwise. Our team discovered pivotal
	 evidence through careful cross-examination that was known in the case
	 as “Tab 4.” It became crucial to our case and had never become
	 public until the trial. This included scientific data that showed a clear
	 link between Risperdal and the condition known as gynecomastia. Even though
	 they had this information, J&J knowingly kept this evidence secret,
	 hiding it from the FDA and burying it from scientific studies.
 The Philadelphia jury found that Johnson & Johnson was guilty of falsifying,
 concealing, and/or destroying evidence. After just 11 days of trial, they
 unanimously agreed that J&J failed to warn of the side effects of
 Risperdal, thus causing our client to develop gynecomastia. They awarded
 our client $76.6 million—the largest single verdict in such a case. 
			Attorney's fees and expenses totaled $0.00.

$72 Million Recovery Obtained for Injured Oilfield Worker
Arnold & Itkin achieved a massive settlement for a worker who lost their arm due to a company’s negligence.

Attorneys Jason Itkin, Cory Itkin, and Kurt Arnold were able to win a massive
	 $72 million victory for our client after less than 2 years of preparation
	 and investigation. Our client, a former oilfield worker, lost his arm
	 and suffered other life-changing injuries in an accident caused by negligence.
	 The companies responsible chose to settle with our client a week before
	 trial was set to begin—giving him the financial security and access
	 to medical care he needs. The settlement is potentially a record-setting
	 size, which has compelled the companies involved to change their policies
	 and ensure this never happens to another worker.
Attorney's fees and expenses totaled $29,340,369.87.

$44 Million Jury Award for Crane Accident Victim
Arnold & Itkin LLP helped represent a man who had been severely injured in a crane accident, which caused his leg to be amputated. Lead Attorney Kurt Arnold helped to win $44 million on his behalf (which is the largest amputee verdict in the country).

As lead attorney, Kurt Arnold helped represent a construction superintendent
	 whose leg was amputated in an above-the-knee procedure following severe
	 crush injuries sustained in a crane accident. Our client was a 31-year-old
	 man who had been working on a construction job in Houston, TX at the time
	 of the incident. A crane operator had been working to unstick the auger
	 when the crane collapsed. Prior to the collapse, the crane operator had
	 attempted to stop the job at least five separate times; however, the superintendent
	 had refused.
Our client had been standing behind a safety fence approximately 100 feet
	 from the auger when he was struck by a piece of equipment that pinned
	 him to the ground. After a crane lifted the equipment off of our client,
	 he was taken to a local hospital where the amputation was performed. Over
	 a three week trial, Kurt showed that several safety practices had been
	 violated in an attempt to save both money and time on the project. In
	 the end, the jury awarded $44 million to the client and his family, which
	 included $8.5 million in punitive damages.
This case was listed #43 in The National Law Journal's Top 100 Verdicts of 2015.
Attorney's fees and expenses totaled $0.00.

			 – the plant owners possessed a 16% stake at the time of the explosion.

Arnold & Itkin Wins $15.4 Million Jury Verdict for 4 Workers Injured in 2013 Geismar Explosion
Our firm fought for workers who were injured in the plant explosion, securing them a massive verdict and overcoming the normal limits set by workers’ compensation.

Attorneys Kurt Arnold, Kyle Findley, and Kala Sellers have won a verdict
	 of $15,458,434.32 for our clients, who were injured and traumatized by
	 the Williams Olefins plant explosion in 2013. The blast occurred during
	 a $400 million expansion project, which was initiated while operations
	 continued at the plant. The CEO and the board of directors were warned
	 that continuing operations would put workers at increased risk, but they
	 overruled the safety warnings and ordered that the plant continue operating
	 instead of shutting down for a few months for the expansion project.
As a result, a reboiler over-pressurized from the lack of a functioning
	 valve, causing an explosion that could be seen for miles. Our clients
	 were all injured in the blast and were forced to flee the site immediately.
	 The event left them with both physical and psychological injuries, and
	 they needed compensation to help heal.
The plant’s owners’ parent company, Williams Companies, Inc.,
	 attempted to limit their compensation by placing the blame on Williams
	 Olefins LLC—the holding company for the plant. With a vast amount
	 of experience with plant operations, Arnold & Itkin attorneys set
	 out to find the truth. After receiving over 100,000 documents, we found
	 that the pressure relief valve for the reboiler was not opened.
More importantly, we found that the isolated reboiler was the subject of
	 multiple audits and safety warnings—all of which were ignored, as
	 the necessary repair was never provided. We discovered evidence that the
	 Defendants had “substantial certainty” that an explosion would
	 occur under those circumstances. As a result, our clients could seek compensation
	 beyond the limits set by workers’ compensation. The most vital evidence
	 we found, however, was proof that Williams Companies, Inc. were the true
	 employers of plant managers and personnel, and were in control of daily
	 operations at the site.
During trial, the Defendants insisted that they were protected by the statutory
	 employer defense. They continued to exclusively blame Williams Olefins
	 LLC, which would limit their responsibility for the explosion. However,
	 after 3 weeks the jury saw the truth—they awarded a judgment in
	 favor of the Plaintiffs, and found that the plant managers were actually
	 employees of Williams Companies, Inc.
As a result, the jury assigned 95% responsibility to Williams Companies,
	 Inc. and 3% to Williams Olefins LLC. Both were found to have substantial
	 certainty about the inevitability of an explosion, and so a sizable award
	 was able to be given to our clients.
The jury awarded our clients the following: Shawn Thomas ($9.4 million),
	 Christopher Devall ($3.6 million), Eduardo Elizondo ($360,000), and Michael
	 Danton ($205,000). The award was made of the original judgment ($13,679,933.)
	 as well as pre-judgment interest ($1,778,409.79). All told, our clients
	 were awarded over $15.4 million for their injuries and pain.
Arnold & Itkin was proud to help our clients get the help and justice
	 they needed. We are also honored to be representing over 100 more workers
	 in upcoming trials with Clayton, Fruge, and Ward—fighting to get
	 every injured worker the compensation due to them. This case was presided
	 over by the Honorable Elizabeth Engolio and was filed in Iberville Parish,
	 Louisiana.
Attorney's fees and expenses totaled $0.00.

 left severely and permanently injured as a result of an accident on the
 job. Our client was a truck driver and was unloading his cargo when he
 suffered a stroke. As a result, the cargo he was unloading fell on him,
