 Investment AdvisoryWHY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE IAIM AS YOUR RIA
Although International Assets Investment Management, LLC (“IAIM”) is a newly registered SEC Investment Advisor, we are uniquely qualified to provide you with investment advisory services. For example:

IAIM is regulated by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and has more than $250 million assets under management.


IAIM brings you 25 plus years of global investment expertise developed at our affiliated broker/dealer International Assets Advisory, LLC (“IAA”).


As an independent registered investment advisor, we are free to offer you any investment product we believe is appropriate.


You will be partnered with your own investment advisor.


On average our investment advisors have over 15 years of financial industry experience.


Only IAIM can bring you our World Class Money Manager Strategy (“WCMM”) based on a Nobel Prize winning economic theory.

USING A REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISOR (“RIA”)
Seven Reasons to Work with Our Fee-Based Advisors
You will gain a partner. Conflicts of interest are reduced as your investment advisor’s interests are better aligned with your interests. In effect, you and your advisor become one team managing your investment portfolio. Your advisor only earns more if your investments are growing. As a result, both of you are sitting on the same side of the desk. The sole incentive for you and your advisor is to maximize your total return.
No Commissions. We charge no commissions in our fee-based accounts. Instead of transactional commission charges, you pay a simple fee that’s tied to the value of your portfolio. This way, your advisor’s interests are better aligned with yours.*
Great Service. Our goal is to unite our financial expertise with your personal investment goals. Investments selected for your account will be based on your financial objectives and constraints. Once your plan is in place, you will receive regular account updates directly from your investment advisor.
Objective Analysis and Advice. Your investment advisor will recommend and implement specific investments based on your personal asset allocation strategy. There are never quotas to reach or investment vehicles that give the advisor a higher payout; all advice is strictly in the best interest of the client.
Less Paperwork. Consolidating your holdings eliminates the hassle and confusion of receiving multiple statements from numerous investment companies. Our fee-based programs streamline all accounts and statements, creating a high level of efficiency for both the advisor and client.
Full Disclosure. Your advisor is paid to look out for your best interests. We reward advice and service…not sales. Your fee structure will be fully disclosed with no hidden costs or surprise charges. There are situations, however, where a commission-based platform is simply more appropriate. At the onset of each client relationship we have an open discussion about the expected total expenses of either platform and together determine which would be the better option. Things we discuss include whether it would be better to pay separately for each trade executed and each product and service used. Since these factors may change, we periodically re-evaluate whether the ongoing use of a particular asset-based fee program continues to be appropriate for each clients’ needs.
Freedom. By delegating the management of your portfolio to a qualified professional you eliminate the hassle and worry of constantly tending to your investment portfolio. With the client’s direction and guidance we put all of our resources to work. You can feel confident that your money is being carefully watched. With this financial freedom you can spend additional time with your family, your hobbies, or whatever you choose.
*Various no-load fund companies allocate a nominal $25.00 transaction fee.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
