Emily Marlow Beck is the President of Front-Royal based Marlow Automotive Group, which includes dealerships in Front Royal, Winchester, and Luray, Virginia.
Beck has been a member of the LFCC Foundation board of directors since 2013. She also serves on the board of directors for First Bank and the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association and is active in the Front Royal Rotary Club.
She is a graduate of Warren County High School, the University of Virginia, and the American University Washington College of Law. Before returning to the Valley, Beck spent several years practicing law in the Washington, D.C. area. During that time, she was a partner at Hudson Cook, LLP, a nationally recognized law firm that specializes in consumer financial services law.
Beck has a personal connection to Lord Fairfax Community College, as her mother, Joyce Marlow, attended LFCC. “LFCC is one of the best resources we have in our community and has given so many people a chance to go to college or learn a skilled trade,” says Beck. “I’m honored to serve on the Foundation board.”
“We benefit significantly from Emily’s legal and business expertise,” says Liv Heggoy, Executive Director of the LFCC Foundation. “She is also very enthusiastic about making our community a great place to live, work, and learn.” 
Nancie Williams is a partner with WilliamsHeacock, LLC in Front Royal. She is a trial attorney, and her litigation practice includes family law, personal injury, and criminal defense. A sought-after legal lecturer on Virginia foster care and juvenile law, Williams provides a unique perspective and a personal knowledge of growing up as a foster child.
Williams is a graduate of Rappahannock County High School, the University of Virginia, and Howard University School of Law. She is a former Warren County prosecutor.
Chuck McWilliams is a senior associate with Walsh, Colucci, Lubeley & Walsh, PC and heads the firm’s Tax, Estate Planning and Estate Administration Practice. He was listed in Northern Virginia magazine’s Top Lawyers 2015. McWilliams is also a Certified Public Accountant and worked in public accounting before attending law school.
McWilliams grew up in Woodstock, Virginia, and resides in the City of Winchester. He has a Taxation LL.M. from Georgetown University; a J.D. from George Mason University School of Law; a B.S. in Accounting from George Mason; and a B.S. in Political Science from Hampden-Sydney College. In addition to these four academic degrees, McWilliams also took several courses through Lord Fairfax Community College.
The LFCC Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, which raises funds to help the college fulfill its mission to provide accessible, quality academic and workforce training opportunities to all students, regardless of financial need. The LFCC Foundation has a $6.5 million endowment and will award $200,000 in scholarships for the 2016-2017 academic year.
The Foundation’s total assets are valued at $20 million and include the Student Union Building at the Middletown Campus. The $9 million building opened in 2014 and was built on property donated to the LFCC Foundation in 1995. Other recent successes for the LFCC Foundation include the recent purchase of a Subway franchise and a $1 million gift from the PATH Foundation in Warrenton to support the campaign for a new science building at the college’s Fauquier Campus.

Maynard Leckie












New Car Manager
540-635-4158Maynard, who
joined the dealership in 2008, first walked onto Marlow's lot as a teenager to
test drive a lime green, 1976 VW Super Beetle (parked beside the telephone pole
on the south side of the lot).  After
practicing (impatiently) his parents' suggested (and differing) negotiation
styles, Maynard became the proud owner of his first car.  Having worked in
the automotive industry since 1980, Maynard's experience includes working in
management for an auto supplier plant in Michigan.  Mr. Leckie is a Front Royal native and Stephens City
resident.  Maynard is married with two
children, and his passions include grilling, fishing, and shooting.  Mr. Leckie's favorite part about the
community is its history, not to mention the fact that his family was an
original founder of Front Royal.

Maynard has considered himself a "car person" his entire life.  This translates into his passion and
knowledge about every Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram that he sells, in which he
truly believes are superior products in price and performance.  Maynard's "on the lot" dream car is a Ram
truck.  His favorite quote is, "To
succeed in life you need two things: ignorance and confidence." - Mark Twain
