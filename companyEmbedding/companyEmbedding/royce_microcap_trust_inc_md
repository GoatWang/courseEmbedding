	INTRODUCTION





	The enclosed
	Proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the Board) for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Meeting) of
	Royce Micro-Cap Trust, Inc. (the Fund), to be held at the offices of
	the Fund, 745 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10151, on Thursday, September 24,
	2015, at 3:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) and at any postponements or adjournments thereof.
	The approximate mailing date of this Proxy Statement is August 10, 2015.




	All properly
	executed Proxies received prior to the Meeting will be voted at the Meeting in accordance
	with the instructions marked thereon or otherwise as provided therein. Unless instructions
	to the contrary are marked, Proxies will be voted FOR the election of
	the Director nominees of the Fund.




	You may revoke
	your Proxy at any time before it is exercised by sending written instructions to
	the Secretary of the Fund at the Funds address indicated above or by filing
	a new Proxy with a later date, and any stockholder attending the Meeting may vote
	in person, whether or not he or she has previously filed a Proxy.




	The cost of
	soliciting proxies will be borne by the Fund, which will reimburse brokerage firms,
	custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses in forwarding proxy material
	to the beneficial owners of the Funds shares of common stock (Common
	Stock). Some officers and employees of the Fund and/or Royce & Associates,
	LLC (R&A or Royce), the Funds investment adviser,
	may solicit proxies personally and by telephone, if deemed desirable. Stockholders
	vote at the Meeting by casting ballots (in person or by proxy) which are tabulated
	by one or two persons, appointed by the Board before the Meeting, who serve as Inspectors
	and Judges of Voting at the Meeting and who have executed an Inspectors and
	Judges Oath.




	1







	The Board
	has set the close of business on July 17, 2015 as the record date (the Record
	Date) for determining those stockholders entitled to vote at the Meeting or
	any postponement or adjournment thereof, and only holders of record at the close
	of business on that day will be entitled to vote. Stockholders on the Record Date
	will be entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of Common Stock held (proportional
	voting rights for fractional shares held), with no shares having cumulative voting
	rights.




	As of the
	Record Date, there were 34,872,044 shares of Common Stock outstanding. The following
	persons were known to the Fund to be beneficial owners or owners of record of 5%
	or more of its outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date:

	The Board knows of no business
	other than that stated in Proposal 1 of the Notice of Meeting that will be presented
	for consideration at the Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented at the
	Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, it is the intention of the persons
	named on the enclosed Proxy to vote in accordance with their best judgment.

	PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS





	At the Meeting,
	three members of the Board will be elected. The Board has nine Directors. The nine
	Directors are currently divided into three classes, each class having a term of
	office of three years. The term of office of one class expires each year. Each of
	Charles M. Royce, G. Peter OBrien, and David L. Meister currently serves as
	a Class I director and has been nominated by the Board to serve as a Class I director
	for a three-year term to expire at the Funds 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
	or until his successor is duly elected and qualified.




	The classes
	of Directors and their respective terms are indicated below.






	CLASS I DIRECTORS TO SERVE UNTIL 2018
	ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS



	Charles M. Royce

	G. Peter OBrien

	David L. Meister

	CLASS II DIRECTORS SERVING UNTIL 2016
	ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS



	Arthur S. Mehlman

	Patricia W. Chadwick

	Michael K. Shields




	Each of the
	three Director nominees has agreed to serve if elected, and the Funds management
	has no reason to believe that any of them will be unavailable for service as a Director.
	However, if any of them become unwilling or unable to serve, the persons named in
	the accompanying Proxy will vote for the election of such other persons, if any,
	as the Board may nominate.

	The Board
	believes that each Directors experience, qualifications, attributes and skills
	should be evaluated on an individual basis and in consideration of the perspective
	such Director brings to the entire Board, with no single Director, or particular
	factor, being indicative of Board effectiveness. However, the Board believes that
	Directors need to have the ability to critically review, evaluate, question and
	discuss information provided to them, and to interact effectively with Fund management,
	service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment
	in the performance of their duties; the Board believes that their members satisfy
	this standard. Experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through
	a Directors educational background; business, professional training or practice,
	public service or academic positions; experience from service as a board member
	(including the Board) or as an executive of investment funds, public companies or
	significant private or non-profit entities or other organizations; and/or other
	life experiences. The charter for the Boards Nominating Committee contains
	certain other specific factors considered by the Nominating Committee in identifying
	and selecting Director candidates (as described below).




	To assist
	them in evaluating matters under federal and state law, the Directors are counseled
	by their own independent legal counsel, who participates in Board meetings and interacts
	with R&A, and also may benefit from information provided by R&As
	internal counsel; both Board and R&As internal counsel have significant
	experience advising funds and fund board members. The Board and its committees have
	the ability to engage other experts as appropriate. The Board evaluates its performance
	on an annual basis.





	Board Composition and Leadership Structure





	The Investment
	Company Act requires that at least 40% of the Funds Directors not be interested
	persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Fund and as such
	are not affiliated with R&A (Independent Directors). To rely on
	certain exemptive rules under the Investment Company Act, a majority of the Funds Directors must be Independent Directors, and for certain important matters,
	such as the approval of investment advisory agreements or transactions with affiliates,
	the Investment Company Act or the rules thereunder require the approval of a majority
	of the Independent Directors. Currently, more than 75% of the Funds Directors
	are Independent Directors. The Board does not have a chairman, but the President,
	an interested person of the Fund, acts as chairman at the Board meetings. The Independent
	Directors have not designated a lead Independent Director, but the Chairman
	of the Audit Committee, Mr. Mehlman, generally acts as chairman of meetings or executive
	sessions of the Independent Directors and, when appropriate, represents the views
	of the Independent Directors to management. The Board has determined that its leadership
	structure is appropriate in light of the services that Royce and its affiliates
	provide to the Fund and potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these
	relationships.

	Audit Committee Report





	The Board
	has a standing Audit Committee (the Audit Committee), which consists
	of the Independent Directors who also are independent as defined in
	the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The current members of the
	Audit Committee are Patricia W. Chadwick, Richard M. Galkin, Stephen L. Isaacs,
	Arthur S. Mehlman, David L. Meister, G. Peter OBrien, and Michael K. Shields.
	Mr. Mehlman serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Ms. Chadwick and Mr. Mehlman
	have been designated as Audit Committee Financial Experts, as defined under Securities
	and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.




	The principal
	purposes of the Audit Committee are to (i) assist Board oversight of the (a) integrity
	of the Funds financial statements; (b) independent accountants qualifications
	and independence; and (c) performance of the Funds independent accountants
	and (ii) prepare, or oversee the preparation of any audit committee report required
	by rules of the SEC to be included in the Funds proxy statement for its annual
	meeting of stockholders. The Board has adopted an Audit Committee charter for the
	Fund which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A.




	The Audit
	Committee also has (i) received written disclosures and the letter required by Independence
	Standards Board Standard No. 1 from Tait, Weller & Baker (TW&B),
	the Funds independent auditors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014,
	and (ii) discussed certain matters required to be discussed under the requirements
	of The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board with TW&B. The Audit Committee
	has considered whether the provision of non-audit services by the Funds independent
	accountants is compatible with maintaining their independence.




	At its meetings
	held on February 17, 2015 and February 24-25, 2015, the Audit Committee reviewed
	and discussed the audit of the Funds financial statements as of December 31,
	2014 and for the fiscal year then ended with Fund management and TW&B. Had
	any material concerns arisen during the course of the audit and the preparation
	of the audited financial statements mailed to stockholders and included in the Funds 2014 Annual Report to Stockholders, the Audit Committee would have been notified
	by Fund management or TW&B. The Audit Committee received no such notifications.
	At those meetings, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Funds
	audited financial statements be included in the Funds 2014 Annual Report to
	Stockholders.




	10








	Nominating Committee





	The Board
	has a Nominating Committee (the Nominating Committee) composed of the
	seven Independent Directors, namely Ms. Chadwick and Messrs. Galkin, Isaacs, Mehlman,
	Meister, OBrien, and Shields. Messrs. Galkin and OBrien serve as co-Chairmen
	of the Nominating Committee. The Board has adopted a Nominating Committee Charter
	which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit B.




	The Nominating
	Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending to the Board individuals
	believed to be qualified to become Board members in the event that a position is
	vacated or created. The Nominating Committee will consider Director candidates recommended
	by stockholders. In considering potential nominees, the Nominating Committee will
	take into consideration (i) the contribution which the person can make to the Board,
	with consideration given to the persons business and professional experience,
	education and such other factors as the Committee may consider relevant, including
	but not limited to whether a potential nominees personal and professional
	qualities and attributes would provide a beneficial diversity of skills, experience
	and/or perspective to the Board; (ii) the character and integrity of the person;
	(iii) whether or not the person is an interested person as defined in
	the Investment Company Act and whether the person is otherwise qualified under applicable
	laws and regulations to serve as a Director or Independent Director of the Fund;
	(iv) whether or not the person has any relationships that might impair his or her
	independence, such as any business, financial or family relationships with Fund
	management, the investment adviser of the Fund, Fund service providers or their
	affiliates; (v) whether or not the person is financially literate pursuant to the
	New York Stock Exchanges audit committee membership standards; (vi) whether
	or not the person serves on boards of, or is otherwise affiliated with, competing
	financial service organizations or their related investment company complexes; (vii)
	whether or not the person is willing to serve as, and willing and able to commit
	the time necessary for the performance of the duties of, a Director of the Fund;
	and (viii) whether or not the selection and nomination of the person would be in
	the best interest of the Fund in light of the requirements of the Funds retirement
	policies. While the Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy regarding
	diversity, as noted above, it may consider the diversity of skills, experience and/or
	perspective a potential nominee will bring to the Board as part of its evaluation
	of the contribution such potential nominee will make to the Board. Such factors
	will be considered in light of the other factors described above and in the context
	of the Boards existing membership at the time such potential candidate is
	considered.




	11







	To have a
	candidate considered by the Nominating Committee, a stockholder must submit the
	recommendation in writing and must include biographical
	information and set forth the qualifications of the proposed nominee. The stockholder
	recommendation and information described above must be sent to the Funds Secretary,
	John E. Denneen, c/o Royce Micro-Cap Trust, Inc., 745 Fifth Avenue, New York, New
	York 10151.




	Although the
	Board does not have a standing compensation committee, the Independent Directors
	review their compensation annually.





	Boards Oversight Role in Management





	The Boards role in management of the Fund is oversight. As is the case with virtually
	all investment companies (as distinguished from operating companies), service providers
	to the Fund, primarily R&A and its affiliates, have responsibility for the
	day-to-day management of the Fund, which includes responsibility for risk management
	(including management of investment performance and investment risk, valuation risk,
	issuer and counterparty credit risk, compliance risk and operational risk). As part
	of its oversight, the Board, acting at its scheduled meetings, or the Chairman of
	the Audit Committee, acting between Board meetings, regularly interacts with and
	receives reports from senior personnel of service providers, including the Funds and R&As Chief Compliance Officer and portfolio management personnel.
	The Audit Committee (which consists of the seven Independent Directors) meets during
	its scheduled meetings, and between meetings the Chairman of the Audit Committee
	maintains contact with the Funds independent registered public accounting
	firm and the Funds Treasurer. The Board also receives periodic presentations
	from senior personnel of R&A or its affiliates regarding risk management generally,
	as well as periodic presentations regarding specific operational, compliance or
	investment areas such as business continuity, anti-money laundering, personal trading,
	valuation, investment research and securities lending. The Board also receives reports
	from counsel to R&A and the Boards own independent legal counsel regarding
	regulatory, compliance and governance matters. The Boards oversight role does
	not make the Board a guarantor of the Funds investments or activities.






	Committee and Board of Directors Meetings





	During the
	year ended December 31, 2014, the Board held seven meetings, the Audit Committee
	held four meetings, and the Nominating Committee did not hold any meetings. Each
	Director then in office attended 75% or more of the aggregate of the total number
	of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings of the Audit Committee
	held during that year.









	Compensation of Directors





	For the year
	ended December 31, 2014, each Independent Director received a base fee of $11,000
	per year, plus $500 for each in-person meeting of the Board attended. No Director
	received remuneration for services as a Director for the year ended December 31,
	2014 in addition to or in lieu of this standard arrangement. Each Independent Director
	will continue to receive a base fee of $11,000 per year,
	plus $500 for each in-person meeting of the Board attended for the year ending December
	31, 2015.




	12







	Set forth below is the aggregate compensation
	paid by the Fund and the total compensation paid by The Royce Funds and the Fund
	Complex to each Independent Director of the Fund for the year ended December 31,

	Stockholder
	Communications





	Stockholders
	may send written communications to the Board or to an individual Director by mailing
	such correspondence to the Secretary of the Fund (addressed to 745 Fifth Avenue,
	New York, New York 10151). Such communications must be signed by the stockholder
	and identify the number of shares of Common Stock held by the stockholder. Properly
	submitted stockholder communications will, as appropriate, be forwarded to the entire
	Board or to the individual Director. Any stockholder proposal submitted pursuant
	to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
	Act), must continue to meet all the requirements of Rule 14a-8. See Additional
	Information  Stockholder Proposals herein.






	Director
	Attendance at Stockholder Meetings





	The Fund has
	no formal policy regarding Director attendance at stockholder meetings. None of
	the Funds Independent Directors attended the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.






	Compliance
	with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act





	Section 16(a)
	of the Exchange Act requires the officers and Directors of the Fund and persons
	who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Funds equity securities,
	to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the
	SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Officers, Directors and greater than ten percent
	stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Fund with copies of
	all Forms 3, 4 and 5 they file.




	Based solely
	on the Funds review of the copies of such forms and amendments thereto, furnished
	to it during or with respect to its most recent fiscal year, and written representations
	from certain reporting persons that they were not required to file Form 5 with respect
	to the most recent fiscal year, the Fund believes that all of its officers, Directors,
	greater than ten percent beneficial owners and other persons subject to Section
	16 of the Exchange Act due to the requirements of Section 30(h) of the Investment
	Company Act (i.e., any investment adviser or affiliated person of the Funds
	investment adviser), have complied with all filing requirements applicable to them
	with respect to transactions in the Funds shares during the Funds most
	recent fiscal year.

	***




	Does not include shares of Common Stock benefically owned by Mr. Clark, if any, which
	information is set forth immediately above under Interested Directors.






	Mr. Royce
	has sole voting power and sole investment power as to the shares beneficially owned
	by him. As of the Record Date, the Funds Directors and officers as a group
	(14 persons) beneficially owned 1,354,811 shares of Common Stock, constituting
	approximately 3.89% of its outstanding shares.




	As of July
	17, 2015, no Independent Director or any of his immediate family members directly
	or indirectly owned any securities issued by Legg Mason or any of its affiliates
	(other than registered investment companies).





	Vote Required





	A quorum consists
	of stockholders representing a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
	entitled to vote, who are present in person or by proxy, and a plurality of all
	of the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is sufficient to elect
	a Director.





	The Board
	of Directors of the Fund recommends that all stockholders vote FOR all Director
	nominees.






	FEES PAID TO INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

	Audit Fees





	The aggregate
	fees paid to TW&B in connection with the annual audit of the Funds financial
	statements and for services normally provided by TW&B in connection with the
	statutory and regulatory filings of the Fund for the fiscal years ended December
	31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 were $33,000 and $34,000, respectively, including
	out of pocket expenses.






	Audit Related
	Fees





	No fees were
	paid to TW&B in connection with assurance and related services related to the
	annual audit of the Fund and for review of the Funds financial statements,
	other than the Audit Fees described above, for each of the fiscal years ended December
	31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.




	16








	Tax Fees





	The aggregate
	fees paid for tax-related services, including preparation of tax returns, tax compliance
	and tax advice, rendered by TW&B to the Fund for the fiscal years ended December
	31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 were $7,100 and $7,200, respectively.






	All Other
	Fees





	There were
	no other fees billed for non-audit services rendered by TW&B to the Fund for
	the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. The aggregate non-audit
	fees billed by TW&B for services rendered to R&A and any entity controlling,
	controlled by, or under common control with R&A that provides ongoing services
	to the Fund for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 were
	$7,100 and $7,200, respectively. The Audit Committee has determined that the provision
	of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence
	of TW&B.




	TW&B
	did not provide any other professional services to the Fund or R&A for the
	year ended December 31, 2014. No representatives of TW&B are expected to be
	present at the Meeting.





	Audit Committees Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures





	The Audit
	Committee has adopted policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of
	audit and non-audit services. On an annual basis, at the December meeting of the
	Audit Committee, the independent auditors of the Fund will submit a schedule of
	proposed audit, audit-related, tax and other non-audit services to be rendered to
	the Fund and/or R&A and its affiliates for the following year that require
	pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Such schedule will include the maximum fees
	that can be paid for such services without further Audit Committee approval. Any
	subsequent revision to pre-approved services or fees will be considered at the next
	regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. Services not presented for pre-approval
	at the December meeting of the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Chief Financial
	Officer of the Fund for a determination that the proposed services fit within the
	independence guidelines and then considered for pre-approval at the next regularly
	scheduled Audit Committee meeting. A proposal to commence an engagement involving
	audit, audit-related or tax services prior to the next regularly scheduled Audit
	Committee meeting shall be made in writing by the Chief Financial Officer to all
	Audit Committee members and include a summary of the engagement, estimated maximum
	cost, the category of services and the rationale for engaging the Funds independent
	auditor. Such proposed engagement can be pre-approved by any Audit Committee member
	who is an Independent Director. Pre-approval by the Chairman of the Audit Committee
	is required for a proposed engagement involving non-audit services other than audit-related
	or tax.






	Change in Independent Auditors





	At their February 2015 meetings, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, replacing TW&B as the
	Funds independent registered public accounting firm with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC). As a result, PWC will serve as the Funds independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015. The replacement of TW&B with PWC was not the result of any disagreements between TW&B and any of the Audit Committee, the Board, or R&A. During the two most recent fiscal years, TW&B's audit reports contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion; nor were the reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. Further, there were no disagreements between the Fund and TW&B during such periods as to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or audit scope, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of TW&B, would have caused it to make reference to the disagreements in connection with its reports. Representatives of PWC are not expected to be present at the Meeting.

	ADDITIONAL
	INFORMATION






	Postponement or Adjournment of Meeting;
	Other Matters





	In the event
	that sufficient votes in favor of Proposal 1 in the Notice of Annual Meeting of
	Stockholders are not received by the time scheduled for the Meeting, the persons
	named as proxies may propose one or more postponements or adjournments of the Meeting
	to permit further solicitation of proxies for such Proposal. Any such postponement
	or adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present
	in person or by proxy at the session of the Meeting to be postponed or adjourned,
	as applicable. The persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such postponement
	or adjournment those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of the
	Proposal. They will vote against any such postponement or adjournment those proxies
	required to be voted against the Proposal.




	While the
	Meeting has been called to transact any business that may properly come before it,
	the Directors know of no business other than the matter stated in the Notice of
	Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, if any additional matter properly comes
	before the Meeting and on all matters incidental to the conduct of the Meeting,
	it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed Proxy to vote the Proxy
	in accordance with their judgment on such matters.




	The Fund expects
	that broker-dealer firms holding shares of the Fund in street name for
	the benefit of their customers and clients will request the instructions of such
	customers and clients on how to vote their shares on the Proposal before the Meeting.
	The Fund understands that, under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, such
	broker-dealers may, without instructions from such customers and clients, grant
	authority to the proxies designated by the Fund to vote on the election of Directors
	if no instructions have been received prior to the date specified in the broker-dealer
	firms request for voting instructions. Certain broker-dealer firms may exercise
	discretion over shares held in their name for which no instructions are received
	by voting such shares in the same proportion as they have voted shares for which
	they have received instructions.




	The shares
	as to which the Proxies so designated are granted authority by broker-dealer firms
	to vote on the matters to be considered at the Meeting, the shares as to which broker-dealer
	firms have declined to vote (broker non-votes) and the shares as to
	which Proxies are returned by record stockholders but which are marked abstain on any matter will be included in the Funds tabulation of the total
	number of votes present for purposes of determining whether the necessary quorum
	of stockholders exists. However, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted
	as votes cast. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes will not have an effect
	on the election of Directors.

	business from the floor at an annual meeting of stockholders. Notice of any such
	nomination or other business intended to be presented at the Funds 2016 Annual

	I.              

	Composition of the Audit Committee






	The Audit
	Committee shall be composed of at least three Directors/Trustees, each of whom:






	 




	(a)




	 





	shall not
	be an interested person of the Fund, as defined in Section 2(a)(19)
	of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act);







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	(b)




	 





	shall not
	accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee
	from the Fund (other than fees for serving on the Board of Directors/Trustees or
	any committee thereof); and







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	(c)




	 





	shall be
	financially literate at the time of his or her appointment to the Audit Committee,
	as such qualification is interpreted by the Board of Directors/Trustees in its business
	judgment, or shall become financially literate within a reasonable period of time
	after his or her appointment to the Audit Committee.







	In the event
	Fund shares are or become listed on a national securities exchange or are or become
	quoted on a national market quotation system, the additional qualification requirements
	set forth below also shall apply:






	 




	(d)




	 




	each Director/Trustee
	who is a member of the Audit Committee shall satisfy the applicable independence
	requirements for any such national securities exchange or national market quotation
	system; and






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	(e)




	 




	at least one
	Director/Trustee who is a member of the Audit Committee shall have accounting or
	related financial management expertise as the Board of Directors/Trustees interprets
	such qualification in its business judgment.






	The Board
	of Directors/Trustees shall determine annually: (i) whether at least one of the
	members of the Audit Committee is an audit




	A-1







	committee
	financial expert, as defined in rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	and (ii) whether simultaneous service on more than three public company audit committees
	by a member of the Audit Committee would not impair the ability of such member to
	effectively serve on the Audit Committee, and,

	with respect to the closed-end
	funds only

	, the Board must disclose any determination made under clause (ii)
	either on or through the applicable Funds website or in its annual proxy statement.
	If the disclosure is made on the Funds website, the Fund must disclose that
	fact in its annual proxy statement and provide the website address. Multiple boards
	in the same fund complex are considered one board for this determination.





	II.            

	Purposes of the Audit Committee






	The Audit
	Committee shall be responsible for:






	 




	(1)




	 




	assisting
	Board oversight of the









	 




	(a)

	(b)




	 




	independent
	accountants qualifications and independence; and






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	(c)




	 




	performance
	of the Funds independent accountants; and









	 




	(2)




	 





	preparation,
	or overseeing the preparation of, any audit committee report required by rules of
	the Securities and Exchange Commission to be included in the Funds proxy statement
	for its annual meeting of stockholders.








	III.            

	Responsibilities and Duties of the Audit Committee






	The Funds
	independent accountants shall report directly to the Audit Committee.




	As may be
	necessary or appropriate to carry out its purposes, or to comply with applicable
	law or the requirements of any securities exchange or market quotation system on
	which Fund shares are or may become listed or quoted, the Audit Committee shall

	the independent accountants and the Fund, the Investment Adviser, the Funds

	press releases that discuss earnings (if any), as well as financial information
	or earnings guidance provided to analysts and ratings agencies (this may be done
	generally,

	e.g

	., the type of information to be disclosed and the type of
	presentation to be made); and







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	(p)




	 





	to perform
	such other functions and to have such other powers consistent with this Charter,
	the Funds Articles of Incorporation or Declaration of Trust, as amended and
	supplemented, the Funds By-laws, as amended, and applicable law, as the Audit
	Committee or the Board deems necessary or appropriate.







	The Audit
	Committee may delegate any portion of its authority, including the authority to
	grant preapprovals of audit related services and permitted non-audit services, to
	a subcommittee of one or more members of the Audit Committee pursuant to preapproval
	policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee; provided, however, that
	the Audit Committee may not delegate preapproval of the audit required by the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934. Any decision of such subcommittee of the Audit Committee to
	grant preapprovals shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly
	scheduled meeting.




	A-5







	The function
	of the Audit Committee is oversight; it is the responsibility
	of Fund management to maintain appropriate systems for accounting and internal control
	over financial reporting, and the responsibility of the Funds independent
	accountants to plan and carry out a proper audit. Specifically, Fund management
	is responsible for: (1) the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Funds financial statements; (2) the maintenance of appropriate accounting and financial
	reporting principles and policies; and (3) the maintenance of internal control over
	financial reporting and other procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting
	standards and related laws and regulations. The Funds independent accountants
	are responsible for planning and carrying out an audit consistent with applicable
	legal and professional standards and the terms of their engagement letter. Nothing
	in this Charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities
	of the Funds service providers, including the Funds independent accountants.




	Although the
	Audit Committee is expected to review appropriately the matters that come before
	it, such review of a Funds financial statements by the Audit Committee is
	not an audit, nor does the Committees review substitute for the responsibilities
	of the Funds management for preparing, or the Funds independent accountants
	for auditing, the financial statements. Members of the Audit Committee are not employees
	of the Fund and, in serving on the Audit Committee, are not, and do not hold themselves
	out to be, acting as accountants or auditors. As such, it is not the duty or responsibility
	of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct field work or other
	types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures.




	In discharging
	their duties, the members of the Audit Committee are entitled to rely on information,
	opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial
	data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers of the Fund whom the
	Board reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
	(2) legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the Board
	reasonably believes are within the persons professional or expert competence;
	or (3) a committee of the Board.





	IV.              

	Meetings






	The Audit
	Committee shall meet on a regular basis but no less frequently than annually. The
	Audit Committee periodically shall meet separately with the Funds independent
	accountants, Fund management, and representatives of Fund management responsible
	for the financial and accounting operations of the Fund. The Audit Committee may
	hold special meetings at such times as the Audit Committee believes necessary or
	appropriate. Members of the Audit Committee may participate in a meeting of the
	Audit Committee by means of conference call or similar communications
	equipment by means of which all persons participating in such meeting can hear each
	other.




	A-6








	V.              

	Assistance from Fund Management; Authority to Engage Advisers; Funding






	The appropriate
	officers of the Fund shall provide or arrange to provide such information, data
	and services as the Audit Committee may request. The Audit Committee shall have
	the power and authority to take all action it believes necessary or appropriate
	to discharge its responsibilities, including the power and authority to retain independent
	counsel and other advisers. The Fund shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined
	by the Audit Committee as a committee of the Board, for payment of: (i) compensation
	to the Funds independent accountants or any other accounting firm engaged
	for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit,
	review, or attest services for the Fund,

	(ii) compensation to any advisers employed
	by the Audit Committee under this Section V, and (iii) ordinary administrative expenses
	of the Audit Committee that are necessary or appropriate in carrying out its responsibilities.





	VI.            

	Annual Performance Evaluation






	The Audit
	Committee shall perform a review and evaluation, at least annually, of the performance
	of the Audit Committee.





	VII.           

	Reporting






	The Audit
	Committee shall report regularly to the Board. The Chairman of the Audit Committee
	shall report to the Board on the results of its deliberations, and make such recommendations
	as deemed necessary or appropriate.





	VIII.           

	Amendments






	This Charter
	may be amended or modified from time to time by vote of the Board.





	Dated:  April 11, 2000, as amended through December 12, 2013

	of the Committee (which may or may not be all of the Independent Directors) and
	shall designate the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee shall have authority

	N

	OMINEES






	In identifying
	and evaluating a person as a potential nominee to serve as an Independent Director
	of the Fund, the Committee should consider among other factors it may deem relevant:






	 




	




	 





	the contribution
	which the person can make to the Board, with consideration being given to the persons business and professional experience, education and such other factors as
	the Committee may consider relevant, including but not limited to whether a potential
	nominees personal and professional qualities and attributes would provide
	a beneficial diversity of skills, experience and/or perspective to the Board;







	B-1









	 




	




	 





	the character
	and integrity of the person; whether or not the person is an interested person as defined in the 1940 Act and whether the person
	is otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a Director
	or Independent Director of the Fund;







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	




	 





	whether
	or not the person has any relationships that might impair his independence, such
	as any business, financial or family relationships with Fund management, the investment
	adviser of the Fund, Fund service providers or their affiliates;







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	




	 





	whether
	or not the person is financially literate pursuant to the applicable Exchanges
	audit committee membership standards;







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	

	or not the person serves on boards of, or is otherwise affiliated with, competing
	financial service organizations or their related investment company complexes;







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	




	 





	whether
	or not the person is willing to serve as, and willing and able to commit the time
	necessary for the performance of the duties of a Director of the Fund;







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	




	 





	whether
	or not the selection and nomination of the person would be in the best interest
	of the Fund in light of the requirements of the Funds retirement policies.







	While the
	Committee is solely responsible for the selection and nomination of the Funds
	Independent Directors, the Committee shall review and consider nominations for the
	office of Director made by management and by Fund stockholders as it deems appropriate.
	Stockholders who wish to recommend a nominee should send nominations to the Secretary
	of the Fund which include biographical information and set forth the qualifications
	of the proposed nominee.





	Q

	UORUM






	A majority
	of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
	business, and the act of a majority of the members of the Committee present at any
	meeting at which there is quorum shall be the act of the Committee.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

"Our task is to scour the large and diverse universe of micro-cap companies for businesses that look mispriced and underappreciated, with the caveat being that they must also have a discernible margin of safety. We are looking for stocks trading at a discount to our estimate of their worth as businesses."—Chuck Royce

The Morningstar Style Map is the Morningstar Style Box with the center 75% of fund holdings plotted as the Morningstar Ownership Zone. The Morningstar Style Box is designed to reveal a fund's investment strategy. The Morningstar Ownership Zone provides detail about a portfolio's investment style by showing the range of stock sizes and styles. The Ownership Zone is derived by plotting each stock in the portfolio within the proprietary Morningstar Style Box. The shaded area represents the center 75% of the Fund's assets while the plot point in the middle represents the weighted average of its holdings. Over time, the shape and location of a fund's ownership zone may vary.
