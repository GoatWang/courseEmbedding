Pyxis Tankers Inc. Completes Merger with LookSmart, Ltd. and Expects to Commence Trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market Today

Oct 28, 2015, 13:43 ET
		  		  			
									 from   Pyxis Tankers Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


MAROUSSI, Greece, October 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
Pyxis Tankers Inc. ("Pyxis"), an international maritime transportation company with a focus on the product tanker sector, announced today that it completed its merger with LookSmart, Ltd ("LookSmart"). Pyxis' common stock has been approved to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.  Pyxis' common stock will be traded on a "when issued" basis under the symbol "PXSSV" today and begin regular way trading under the trading symbol "PXS" starting from October 29, 2015.
In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, LookSmart merged with and into Maritime Technologies Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Pyxis. As a condition precedent to the consummation of the merger, LookSmart transferred all of its business, assets and liabilities to its wholly owned subsidiary, LookSmart Group, Inc.  ("LSG"), and then spun off the ownership of LSG to the LookSmart shareholders. Upon consummation of the spin-off and immediately prior to the consummation of the merger, LookSmart consummated a 1 to .1512 reverse split, thereby reducing the number of its shares outstanding from 5,768,851 to 872,036. In connection with the closing of the merger, each post-split share of LookSmart will be cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive 1.0667 shares of Pyxis common stock.  Immediately following the merger, Pyxis has a total of 18,243,143 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As a result of the merger, LookSmart's stock was suspended as of the close of trading on October 27, 2015 and no longer trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market.
Valentios Valentis, Chairman and CEO of Pyxis stated, "As a NASDAQ listed company, we are excited about our industry, our operations and opportunities for growth as well as developing a mutually beneficial relationship with the investment community."
About Pyxis Tankers Inc.  
Pyxis Tankers Inc. is a holding company incorporated on March 23, 2015 under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Pyxis owns a fleet comprised of six double hull product tankers, which had a weighted average age of 4.3 years as of June 30, 2015, based on deadweight tonnage, that are employed under a mix of short- and medium-term time charters and spot charters. Four of the vessels in the fleet are medium-range, or MR, product tankers, three of which have eco-efficient or eco-modified designs, and two of which are short-range tanker sister ships. Each of the vessels in the fleet is capable of transporting refined petroleum products, such as naphtha, gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil, as well as other liquid bulk items, such as vegetable oils and organic chemicals.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Announces Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017GlobeNewswire•May 18, 2017ReblogShareTweetSharePyxis Tankers Inc. Announces Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Maroussi, Greece, May 18, 2017 - Pyxis Tankers Inc. (NASDAQ Cap Mkts: PXS), an emerging growth pure play product tanker company, today announced unaudited results for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Summary For the three months ended March 31, 2017, our time charter equivalent revenues were $4.7 million, which resulted in a net loss of $1.7 million, or a loss per share (basic and diluted) of $0.09, and our EBITDA (see "Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions" below) was $0.4 million. We reached preliminary agreement to extend the maturity of approximately one-third of the outstanding principal of our debt until September 2022. Valentios Valentis, our Chairman and CEO commented: "Our results for the first quarter of 2017 reflected a continuation of a challenging chartering environment. Spot and period charter rates were volatile during the quarter but improved slightly overall, especially for modern eco-efficient tankers. Modest demand growth reduced high inventories of refined products in storage and improved voyage activity. However, we expect chartering activity to continue to be choppy for most of 2017, but believe in a longer term improvement starting in late 2017 due to attractive market fundamentals, such as, significantly lower scheduled deliveries of new build medium range tankers ("MRs") combined with projected solid growth in consumption and export-oriented refinery cargoes. Consequently, we intend to continue to maintain our mixed chartering strategy. As of May 15, 2017, we had two vessels on time charter and the balance of our fleet on spot charters, which positions us to take advantage of improving rates when they occur. "Overall, we continue to be pleased with our disciplined, cost-effective operating structure. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, we saw a fleet-wide improvement in our daily vessel operating expenses as compared to the same period in 2016. "As of March 31, 2017, our net debt stood at $68.4 million, and the weighted average interest rate was approximately 3.5% during the first quarter of 2017. In May 2017, one of our lenders agreed, subject to execution of customary documentation, to extend the maturity of the loans with respect to two of our vessels, which represents approximately $25.0 million of our outstanding debt, for an additional four years to September 2022. Once this amendment is in place, the first scheduled balloon payment with respect to our bank debt will be due in the second quarter of 2020, which enhances our financial flexibility. "As part of our strategic plan, Pyxis Tankers continues to focus on acquisition opportunities. The long-term economics are attractive for the acquisition of a quality second-hand MR2 with current vessel prices substantially below 10-year averages."  Results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017 For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we reported a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.09 basic and diluted loss per share, compared to a net income of $1.1 million, or $0.06 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the same period in 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, our EBITDA was $0.4 million, a decrease of $2.9 million from $3.3 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in time charter equivalent revenues.     Three Months ended March 31,       2016     2017         (Thousands of U.S. dollars, except for daily TCE rates)     Voyage revenues   8,448       7,715     Voyage related costs and commissions   (805)     (3,006)     Time charter equivalent revenues*   7,643       4,709                 Total operating days   533       480                 Daily time charter equivalent rate*   14,339     9,810   * Subject to rounding; please see "Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions" below. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results for the Three Months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017 (Amounts are presented in million U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except as otherwise noted) Voyage revenues: Voyage revenues of $7.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 represented a decrease of $0.7 million, or 8.7%, from $8.4 million in the comparable period in 2016. The decrease during the first quarter of 2017 was attributed to lower time charter equivalent rates as well as to a decrease in total operating days. Voyage related costs and commissions: Voyage related costs and commissions of $3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 represented an increase of $2.2 million, or 273.4%, from $0.8 million in the comparable period in 2016. The increase was primarily attributed to greater spot charter activity which incurs voyage costs. Vessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses of $3.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 represented a decrease of $0.3 million, or 10.2%, from $3.3 million in the comparable period in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributed to our cost efficiencies from the two eco-efficient MR vessels.Read More General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses of $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by $0.1 million, or 16.5%, from $0.7 million in the comparable period in 2016, mainly due to an increase in other professional services. Management fees, related parties: Management fees to our ship manager, Pyxis Maritime Corp., of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 remained relatively stable compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2016. Management fees, other: Management fees mainly payable to International Tanker Management Ltd., our fleet's technical manager, of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 remained relatively stable compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2016, which included the services of North Sea Tankers BV, the former commercial manager of Northsea Alpha and Northsea Beta. Amortization of special survey costs: Amortization of special survey costs was less than $0.1 million for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Depreciation: Depreciation of $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 remained stable compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2016. Bad debt provisions: Bad debt provisions of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 represented an increase in doubtful account for trade receivables. Interest and finance costs, net: Interest and finance costs, net, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $0.7 million and remained relatively stable compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2016. Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income / (Loss)For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share and per share data)     Three Months Ended     Three Months Ended       March 31, 2016     March 31, 2017                       Voyage revenues   8,448     7,715                       Expenses:             Voyage related costs and commissions   (805)       (3,006)     Vessel operating expenses   (3,303)     (2,965)     General and administrative expenses   (660)       (769)     Management fees, related parties   (145)     (175)     Management fees, other   (262)       (232)     Amortization of special survey costs   (62)     (18)     Depreciation   (1,435)       (1,373)     Bad debt provisions   -       (181)     Operating income / (loss)   1,776       (1,004)                       Other expenses:             Interest and finance costs, net   (701)       (699)     Total other expenses, net   (701)       (699)                       Net income / (loss)   1,075       (1,703)                       Earnings / (loss) per common share, basic and diluted   $ 0.06     ($0.09)                       Weighted average number of common shares, basic and diluted   18,277,893     18,277,893    Consolidated Balance SheetsAs of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 (unaudited)(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share and per share data)    December 31, 2016   March 31, 2017     ASSETS                     CURRENT ASSETS:             Cash and cash equivalents   783   465     Restricted cash, current portion   143   142     Inventories   1,173   1,063     Trade receivables, net   1,681   2,968     Prepayments and other assets   404   402     Total current assets   4,184   5,040               FIXED ASSETS, NET:             Vessels, net   121,341   119,968     Total fixed assets, net   121,341   119,968               OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS:             Restricted cash, net of current portion   4,857   4,858     Deferred charges, net   358   340     Total other non-current assets   5,215   5,198     Total assets   130,740   130,206               LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY                       CURRENT LIABILITIES:             Current portion of long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs, current   6,813   6,717     Accounts payable   3,115   3,115     Due to related parties   1,953   5,024     Hire collected in advance   415   446     Accrued and other liabilities   574   724     Total current liabilities   12,870   16,026               NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES:             Long-term debt, net of current portion and deferred financing costs, non-current   66,617   64,630     Promissory note   2,500   2,500     Total non-current liabilities   69,117   67,130                   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES                         STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:           Preferred stock ($0.001 par value;

Total cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, aggregated to $5.5 million as of March 31, 2017. Total debt (in thousands of U.S. dollars), net of deferred financing costs:           As at December       As at March             31, 2016       31, 2017     Bank debt   $   73,430   $   71,347     Promissory Note - related party       2,500       2,500     Total   $   75,930   $   73,847   Our weighted average interest rate on our total debt for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017 was 3.17% and 3.53%, respectively. The increase in the weighted average interest rate resulted from higher LIBOR rates. As noted above, in May 2017, the lender of the Pyxis Delta and the Pyxis Theta, subject to execution of customary documentation, agreed to extend the maturity of its respective loans from September 2018 to September 2022 under the same amortization schedule and applicable margin. As of September 2018, the aggregate outstanding balance of these loans is scheduled to be $20.8 million, which will be subsequently repaid in 16 equal quarterly installments of $0.65 million each, plus a balloon payment of $10.4 million payable together with the last quarterly installment. Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") represents the sum of net income / (loss), interest and finance costs, depreciation and amortization and, if any, income taxes during a period. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. GAAP. EBITDA is presented in this press release as we believe that it provides investors with a means of evaluating and understanding how our management evaluates operating performance. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP measure does not have standardized meaning, and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.         Three Months Ended     (In thousands of U.S. dollars)       March 31, 2016       March 31, 2017     Reconciliation of Net income / (loss) to EBITDA                                           Net income / (loss)   $   1,075   $   (1,703)                           Depreciation       1,435       1,373                           Amortization of special survey costs       62       18                           Interest and finance costs, net       701       699                           EBITDA   $   3,273   $   387   Daily time charter equivalent ("TCE") is a shipping industry performance measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. TCE is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We utilize TCE because we believe it is a meaningful measure to compare period-to-period changes in our performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which our vessels may be employed between the periods. Our management also utilizes TCE to assist them in making decisions regarding employment of the vessels. We calculate TCE by dividing voyage revenues after deducting voyage related costs and commissions by operating days for the relevant period. Voyage related costs and commissions primarily consist of brokerage commissions, port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract. Vessel operating expenses ("Opex") per day are our vessel operating expenses for a vessel, which primarily consist of crew wages and related costs, insurance, lube oils, communications, spares and consumables, tonnage taxes as well as repairs and maintenance, divided by the ownership days in the applicable period. We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during the same period. We use fleet utilization to measure our efficiency in finding suitable employment for our vessels and minimizing the amount of days that our vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys and intermediate dry-dockings or vessel positioning. Ownership days are the total number of days in a period during which we owned each of the vessels in our fleet. Available days are the number of ownership days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and intermediate dry-dockings and the aggregate number of days that we spent positioning our vessels during the respective period for such repairs, upgrades and surveys. Operating days are the number of available days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-hire or out of service due to any reason, including technical breakdowns and unforeseen circumstances.   Recent Daily Fleet Data:                   (Amounts in U.S.$)           Three Months Ended March 31,                 2016       2017     Eco-Efficient MR2: (2 of our vessels)                             TCE       15,698       14,043         Opex       6,334       5,622         Utilization %       99.5%       84.4%     Eco-Modified MR2: (1 of our vessels)                             TCE       17,653       11,050         Opex       6,553       6,347         Utilization %       100.0%       97.8%     Standard MR2: (1 of our vessels)                             TCE       18,730       10,119         Opex       6,445       5,931         Utilization %       100.0%       96.7%     Small Tankers: (2 of our vessels)                             TCE       8,768       4,717         Opex       5,318       4,711         Utilization %       93.4%       85.0%     Fleet: (6 vessels)                             TCE       14,339       9,810         Opex       6,050       5,491         Utilization %       97.6%       88.9%   When we refer to total daily operational costs as applied to our eco-modified and eco-efficient tankers, we define that as the sum of (1) daily Opex per vessel, (2) total general and administrative expenses in the period per day per vessel, and (3) the technical and commercial management fees in the period per day per vessel.

Home  >  Fleet  >  Ship Management








The collaborative approach between our management team and our commercial and technical ship managers creates an effective platform that we believe is able to deliver superior operating results at competitive costs and positions us for further growth.



Management of Ship Operations, Administration and Safety


Historically, our ship manager, Pyxis Maritime Corp. (“Maritime”), and our technical manager, International Tanker Management Ltd. (“ITM”), have entered into individual ship management agreements with our vessel owning subsidiaries to which they provide:

commercial management services, i.e., the chartering, for our vessels and managing those customer relationships;
strategic management services, which include strategic guidance with respect to locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels;
technical management services, which include managing day-to-day vessel operations, performing general vessel maintenance, ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance, supervising the maintenance and general efficiency of vessels, arranging the hire of qualified officers and crew, arranging and supervising drydocking and repairs, arranging insurance for vessels, purchasing stores, supplies, spares and new equipment for vessels, appointing supervisors and technical consultants and providing technical support; and
shoreside personnel who carry out the management functions described above.




Ship Management Agreements with Pyxis Maritime Corp.


Headquartered in Athens, Greece, Maritime was formed in 2007 by our founder and Chief Executive Officer to take advantage of opportunities in the tanker sector. We have entered into a Head Management Agreement with Maritime, pursuant to which Maritime provides us and our vessels, among other things, with ship management services. Under the Head Management Agreement, each of our vessel owning subsidiaries has entered into a separate ship management agreement with Maritime which provides the following services: commercial, sale and purchase, provisions, insurance, bunkering, operations and maintenance, dry-docking and newbuilding construction supervision. Maritime also supervises the crewing and technical management performed by ITM for all our vessels.



Ship Management Agreements with International Tanker Management Ltd.


We outsource the day-to-day technical management of our vessels to an unaffiliated third party, ITM, which has been certified for ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 and is a subsidiary of V.Ships Limited. Each vessel owning subsidiary in our fleet under a time or spot charter has entered into a ship management agreement with ITM which is responsible for all technical management, including crewing, maintenance, repair, drydockings and maintaining required vetting approvals. In performing its services, ITM is responsible to operate a management system that complies, and ensure that each vessel and our crew comply, with all applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.
