Hexion Inc. Key Developments

Hexion Inc. Launches New Two-Component Adhesive for Structural Engineered Wood Lamination
Jul 20 17
Hexion Inc. has introduced a new two-component adhesive system that reduces waste and cleanup costs, enhances durability and supports indoor air quality. This adhesive system, which includes the Ecobind™ 6500 resin and Wonderbond™ Hardener M650Y, is ideal for applications like cross-laminated timbers for tall wood buildings and glue-laminated wood beams. The two components are extruded separately and then mixed when the wood is pressed together. This unique feature provides the user with reduced costs for adhesive waste and cleanup off equipment. Ecobind 6500/Wonderbond M650Y also exceeds all strength, exterior exposure and high-temperature requirements of the North American Structural Wood standards (ANSI A 190.1, 'Structural Glued Laminated Timber,' PRG 320, 'Cross Laminated Timber,' and ASTM D 5456, 'Structural Composite Lumber'). In addition to structural durability, the Ecobind 6500/Wonderbond Hardener M650Y resin system has also achieved UL GREENGUARD Gold Certification. GREENGUARD Gold demonstrates that a product has met some of the world’s most rigorous and comprehensive standards for low emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into indoor air and to account for sensitive individuals (such as children and the elderly). It is recognized, referenced or preferred by more than 400 federal purchasers, retailers, green building rating tools and building codes around the world, according to UL Environment, a division of UL (Underwriters Laboratories).

Hexion Inc. Launches New Epoxy Resin System for SMC Manufacturing of Automotive Composites | Business Wire
























































Hexion Inc. Launches New Epoxy Resin System for SMC Manufacturing of 
      Automotive Composites






March 14, 2017 01:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hexion Inc. (“Hexion” or the “Company”) will introduce a new specialty 
      epoxy resin system for styrene-free, sheet molding compound (SMC) 
      manufacturing of high-performance automotive composites, at the JEC 
      World 2017 composites event in Paris.
    


      The new offering - EPIKOTETM Resin TRAC 06605/EPIKURETM 
      Curing Agent TRAC 06608 - can be used to produce lightweight 
      semi-structural and structural automotive composite parts, such as 
      floors, electrical vehicle battery enclosures, spare wheel tubs, seat 
      structures, hood inners and more. Hexion’s SMC epoxy system, when 
      combined with glass and carbon fibers, results in parts with superior 
      mechanical properties to those made with standard unsaturated polyester 
      (UP) or vinyl ester (VE) SMC resin systems.
    

      Hexion’s epoxy SMC system also emits fewer volatile organic compounds 
      (VOCs) according to VDA 278 than either standard or low VOC vinyl 
      esters, with emissions well below international exposure limits. The VDA 
      278 recommendation governs organic emissions for molded compounds in 
      automobiles. Because Hexion’s epoxy SMC system is styrene-free, there is 
      no need to track worker styrene exposure to comply with European 
      workplace standard. The new epoxy system’s compatibility with equipment 
      used for other types of SMC (UP and VE) means additional capital 
      investment is often unnecessary.
    

      "This new specialty epoxy product line will help our customers 
      manufacture high performance composite parts via high-volume SMC 
      production with reduced scrap and relatively low labor costs,” said 
      Francis Defoor, Global Market Segment Leader Transportation, Hexion. “It 
      complements our full range of products for compression molding, 
      including resin transfer molding (RTM), liquid compression molding 
      (LCM), and prepreg molding.”
    

      The new epoxy SMC product is supplied as an easy-to-handle 
      resin-plus-hardener system with optional mold release agent. Customers 
      have ready access to Hexion’s comprehensive technical assistance. For 
      more information, please consult Hexion—Hall 6, Booth G54—during the JEC 
      World 2017 International Composites Event in Paris, March 14-16, or 
      visit hexion.com/automotive 
      or hexion.com/contacts.

Hexion/Momentive merger made official





















      Momentive Performance Materials has completed acquisition of epoxy manufacturer Hexion Specialty Chemicals, creating a new company that will keep the Momentive name.

Momentive Performance Materials Inc.



 Momentive Performance Materials Holdings Inc. (Albany, N.Y.), the parent company of Momentive Performance Materials Inc., and Hexion LLC (Columbus, Ohio), the parent company of epoxy manufacturer Hexion Specialty Chemicals Inc., completed a previously announced merger on Oct. 1. The resulting firm will retain the Momentive name. The combination creates a company with 117 production facilities, more than 10,000 employees, annualized sales of approximately $7.5 billion (USD) and a pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $1.24 billion. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, the new Momentive makes approximately 28 percent of its sales in fast-growing regions, including the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), with the balance in more mature markets (33 percent in Europe and 39 percent in North America).The combined company is organized into three global business divisions: Silicones and Quartz, led by president Steven Delarge and headquartered in Albany, N.Y.; Epoxy, Phenolic and Coating Resins, led by president Joseph Bevilaqua; and Forest Products, under president Dale Plante. “Our new combined enterprise now can offer a broader portfolio of specialty technologies and products to meet the diverse applications needs of our global customers,” says Momentive chairman and CEO Craig O. Morrison. “These technologies include silicones, epoxies, quartz, phenolics, acrylics, aminos, acids and others that are used alone, or in combination, across thousands of critical industrial and consumer applications where superior performance is required.”Momentive Performance Materials was formed in 2006 through the acquisition of GE Advanced Materials. Hexion Specialty Chemicals was formed in 2005, when the previously independent Borden Chemical Inc., Resolution Performance Products Inc., Resolution Specialty Materials Inc. and Bakelite AG merged into a single entity. Hexion’s (formerly Resolution Performance Product’s) epoxy resin systems are well-established in the composites industry, including EPIKOTE and EPIKURE epoxy systems formulated for wind turbine blade fabrication.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — (BUSINESS WIRE) — March 13, 2017 —

      Hexion Inc. (“Hexion” or the “Company”) will introduce a new specialty 
      epoxy resin system for styrene-free, sheet molding compound (SMC) 
      manufacturing of high-performance automotive composites, at the JEC 
      World 2017 composites event in Paris.
    

      The new offering - EPIKOTETM Resin TRAC 06605/EPIKURETM 
      Curing Agent TRAC 06608 - can be used to produce lightweight 
      semi-structural and structural automotive composite parts, such as 
      floors, electrical vehicle battery enclosures, spare wheel tubs, seat 
      structures, hood inners and more. Hexion’s SMC epoxy system, when 
      combined with glass and carbon fibers, results in parts with superior 
      mechanical properties to those made with standard unsaturated polyester 
      (UP) or vinyl ester (VE) SMC resin systems.
    

      Hexion’s epoxy SMC system also emits fewer volatile organic compounds 
      (VOCs) according to VDA 278 than either standard or low VOC vinyl 
      esters, with emissions well below international exposure limits. The VDA 
      278 recommendation governs organic emissions for molded compounds in 
      automobiles. Because Hexion’s epoxy SMC system is styrene-free, there is 
      no need to track worker styrene exposure to comply with European 
      workplace standard. The new epoxy system’s compatibility with equipment 
      used for other types of SMC (UP and VE) means additional capital 
      investment is often unnecessary.
    

      "This new specialty epoxy product line will help our customers 
      manufacture high performance composite parts via high-volume SMC 
      production with reduced scrap and relatively low labor costs,” said 
      Francis Defoor, Global Market Segment Leader Transportation, Hexion. “It 
      complements our full range of products for compression molding, 
      including resin transfer molding (RTM), liquid compression molding 
      (LCM), and prepreg molding.”
    

      The new epoxy SMC product is supplied as an easy-to-handle 
      resin-plus-hardener system with optional mold release agent. Customers 
      have ready access to Hexion’s comprehensive technical assistance. For 
      more information, please consult Hexion—Hall 6, Booth G54—during the JEC 
      World 2017 International Composites Event in Paris, March 14-16, or
