PGCG Profile


Our company was incepted in 2004 and we have experienced substantial growth to transform into a multinational corporation with business interests across the region. Our rapid expansion has led us to be currently listed on the OTCBB with the trading symbol--“PGCG”. 
                    
Fuelled by the opportunities of globalization, our company has embraced a diversification strategy which has led us to invest in several countries. We are dynamically developing castor and palm oil plantations even as we are becoming a visionary player in the local property development industry. Our investments have a positive impact on the daily lives of many people and they generate substantial returns for our company. 

The demand for oil is increasing even as its supply is decreasing. As such, green energy will certainly be the main alternative source of energy in next decade. To capitalize on the stable development of the green energy industry, we are establishing castor plantations in mainland China and the ASEAN countries. In addition, we are investing heavily in palm oil cultivation. Eventually, we hope to generate a perpetual income stream from the green energy industry. 

In view of the global economic recovery, we have great confidence that the value of properties will appreciate around the world. Consequently, we are embarking on a diversification strategy that involves the acquisition of quality properties, especially in the United States and Malaysia. Our globalization and diversification plans are based on our stable foundation. We are certain that our dynamic endeavors which span Europe, Africa, the United States and Asia will take our organization to even greater heights of success.

Castor Market



                    Castor is one of the world’s top ten oil-seed crops and it is highly competitive in the agriculture environment. Castor cultivation is buoyed by a new wave of worldwide demand for castor oil and so it enjoys great economic potential. Castor oil can resist high combustion levels and has a low consolidation level. As a result of its unique characteristics, it can fulfill the requirements of the aviation industry.

According to the statistics, there are currently 3 million hectares of land that is planted with castor around the world, with 1.5 million tons of castor nuts harvested annually. Unfortunately, the existing demand for castor nuts is not being met. Consequently, castor cultivation and its downstream industries offer tremendous opportunities. Judging from the wide use of castor and its derivatives, the global demand for castor oil in 2011 will reach 80-100 tons, equivalent to 190 – 240 tons of castor nuts. 

Castor plants play an important role in the agricultural economies because it enables them to earn substantial foreign exchange through export of castor beans and oils. The major castor importing markets are the European Union, the United States, Japan and now, China and Thailand. Castor oil has a worldwide demand that is rising 3 to 5 percent per annum. The world production of castor oil seeds is concentrated in a few countries. Consequently, there are only a few large exporters of castor oil fulfilling a significant portion of world demand.

                      Castor seeds contain a high amount of oil--over 50 percent on a dry-weight basis—that is used in a variety of ways. Modem manufacturers have developed many productsby using castor oil and its derivatives, ranging from lipstick to jet-engine lubricants.





Resource From: Lim’s Group http://www.limsgroup.com.hk/



                      Due to widely fluctuating world supplies and the structure of the world market, prices for castor oil vary considerably. The castor oil market has been on a vicious cycle of shortfall and surplus, depending on yields, weather, domestic consumption and economic conditions in the producing countries.





Resource From: Jayant Agro Organics (http://www.jayantagro.com/)



                      Castor oil is a proven competitor in the industrial chemical markets. It is a critical raw material for the industrial chemical markets. It is practical, natural, renewable and very versatile. It has been a staple for the oleochemical markets for a very long time. Castor oil has been used to resolve numerous formulating and processing needs because of its unique fatty acid structure.

PGCG Profile


Our company was incepted in 2004 and we have experienced substantial growth to transform into a multinational corporation with business interests across the region. Our rapid expansion has led us to be currently listed on the OTCBB with the trading symbol--“PGCG”. 
                    
Fuelled by the opportunities of globalization, our company has embraced a diversification strategy which has led us to invest in several countries. We are dynamically developing castor and palm oil plantations even as we are becoming a visionary player in the local property development industry. Our investments have a positive impact on the daily lives of many people and they generate substantial returns for our company. 

The demand for oil is increasing even as its supply is decreasing. As such, green energy will certainly be the main alternative source of energy in next decade. To capitalize on the stable development of the green energy industry, we are establishing castor plantations in mainland China and the ASEAN countries. In addition, we are investing heavily in palm oil cultivation. Eventually, we hope to generate a perpetual income stream from the green energy industry. 

In view of the global economic recovery, we have great confidence that the value of properties will appreciate around the world. Consequently, we are embarking on a diversification strategy that involves the acquisition of quality properties, especially in the United States and Malaysia. Our globalization and diversification plans are based on our stable foundation. We are certain that our dynamic endeavors which span Europe, Africa, the United States and Asia will take our organization to even greater heights of success.
