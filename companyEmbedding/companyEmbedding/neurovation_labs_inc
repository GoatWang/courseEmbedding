Neurovation Labs, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on diagnosing and treating anxiety disorders and in particular Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Neurovation Labs, formed in 2016 and based in New York City, grew out of the research performed by Drs. Michael Fanselow and Jennifer Perusini that sought to understand the cause of PTSD on a physiological level. They discovered that PTSD is manifested through enduring increases in a certain protein (glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 or GRIA1) in the basolateral amygdala, which is a region of the brain central to fear learning.[1] This protein increase provides the first possible objective indicator of PTSD. The discovery was made using a robust and valid model of PTSD in rodents, stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL). The company is currently developing a PTSD diagnostic and a companion treatment based on these discoveries.[2] Dr. Perusini is current CEO of Neurovation Labs. Dr. Fanselow currently acts as Director of Research and Richard Zemsky, J.D. is COO/ in-house counsel.[3]
In October 2016, Neurovation Labs closed a seed funding round. The financing was completed with the support of individual angel investors based in the United States. The company intends to use the proceeds to further the development of its patent-pending PTSD diagnostic.[4]
