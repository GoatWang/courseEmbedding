  Gryphon InvestorsHome > About Gryphon > Firm History and PhilosophyOur History and Philosophy

All private equity firms are not created equal. The character of each team member, their experience, thinking, and tools they utilize differentiates one firm from the next. How these factors coalesce in a disciplined, cohesive strategy is what separates those that exceed and deliver exceptional returns from others.
Operating in the lower-end of the middle market*, Gryphon’s objective is to deliver measurable bottom line value to our companies and superior returns to our investors. We achieve these objectives via an industry focused strategy and high-energy team that bring tremendous industry insights and operational expertise to every transaction. Since Gryphon’s founding in 1995, this tight integration of investment and operational professionals is rare in middle market investing. For Gryphon, it provides a key point of differentiation; for our stakeholders, it drives exceptional returns.
Gryphon’s strategy is time tested and proven. We aggressively seek out and diligently analyze opportunities, focusing on select industry segments where we have developed domain expertise and relevant networks. We understand that, in many cases, our investment and involvement is the first time the management team has considered selling their business or seeking outside capital. That’s why we focus on working together to optimize operations, achieve improved overall performance and gain market dominance. As appropriate, we utilize our networks to augment the team to add depth and needed strength.



Gryphon (GRIF'IN)
Guardian and protector of hidden treasures—a symbol of strength and vigilance.

To date, our strategy has yielded a disproportionate share of proprietary opportunities, a more productive use of time, and exceptional results for all stakeholders.
In every thing we do—from deal sourcing and due diligence to our interchange with our portfolio company teams—we are committed to the highest standard of excellence. This drive is infused in our culture and will remain a cornerstone of our success.
* Companies with $25 to $250 million in annual revenues

Gryphon Investors has completed fundraising for another bridge fund, sources said.
The San Francisco-based private equity firm has collected $365 million for Gryphon Partners 3.5 LP, the people said. That’s well above the $250 million the pool had been seeking, according to an SEC filing dated October 2012.
Marketing for Fund 3.5 began at the end of 2011 and was completed in September, sources said. That’s “a long haul for what was supposed to be an interim fund to a much larger vehicle,” said a placement source.
Gryphon, which targets middle-market companies, raised $415 million with its third buyout fund in 2006. In 2008, the firm deferred fundraising for Fund IV and instead collected $100 million with a bridge fund. 





Sister publication Buyouts reported last November that Gryphon opted to do a second bridge fund instead of the larger fund IV, because firm executives didn’t want to be distracted from deals in a challenging fundraising environment. Marketing for Fund IV would likely have required several meetings a week for two or more years, which would tax the resources of a mid-size firm, Buyouts said at the time.
Fund 3.5 has a three-year investment period, rather than the six-year investment period typical for a larger fund.
Gryphon invests $25 million to $75 million in sectors such as business services, consumer products & services, general industries and healthcare. In March, Gryphon sold TrustHouse Services Group, a contract food service provider,  to French caterer, Elior. In the same month, Synteract, another Gryphon portfolio company, acquired Harrison Clinical Research.
Officials for Gryphon declined comment.
