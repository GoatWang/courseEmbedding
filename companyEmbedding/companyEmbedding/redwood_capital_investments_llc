Redwood is a private investment firm. We have a permanent capital base, a creative approach to investing, and the ability to be agile in our decision-making. We partner with strong management teams to build long-term value in exceptional companies.

Overview
Redwood Capital Investments, LLC manages the capital of a small group of private investors in Baltimore, Maryland. Our investors founded and created the largest privately-held staffing company in the United States and therefore understand what it takes to build successful companies — great management teams who have a passion for business.

Strategy
Redwood’s primary objective is to be a long-term partner with strong management teams and family business owners to build businesses that create value. We seek to diversify our portfolio through investments in special opportunities, real estate, and funds with select portfolio managers.
Redwood does not have any required return thresholds. Rather, we evaluate each investment individually, focusing on value creation and the generation of superior risk-adjusted returns. Due to the permanent capital base provided by our investors, we have a long-term investment horizon. Because our team is small and our investors are accessible, we are agile in our decision-making. This enables us to provide creative solutions that can be tailored to individual investment needs.
We take a fair and straightforward approach, seeking to partner with management teams who have an ownership mentality.
