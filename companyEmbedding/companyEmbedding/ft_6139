This adorable home has so much charm and potential. Great front door with cute windows to let in Light, plenty of built in shelves for storage and decoration. A bright White kitchen that opens to the family room. A Den with a beautiful Wood stove to curl up next to and read a book on a cold winter night. This home has an addition that allows for the potential of a second bedroom. An over sized utility room with a 1/2 bath. The yard is waiting for the next gardener to fill up the flower beds. This home has a garage to keep your car out of the elements. Sellers converted this home to natural gas, put on a new metal roof and gutters. This is a great starter home or summer get away. A little polishing will make this diamond shine.
