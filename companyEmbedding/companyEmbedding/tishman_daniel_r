TISHMAN, U.S. family in real estate and construction. Founded by JULIUS TISHMAN (d. 1936) in the United States in 1898, the Tishman family companies constituted a construction behemoth that built 400 million square feet of hotels and skyscrapers that started with tenements. Julius had five sons and six grandsons and, in various guises, the company continued as a major force through the early years of the 21st century. PAUL TISHMAN joined his father's company in 1924 after graduating from Harvard and doing graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University. He left the company in 1949 to form Paul Tishman Inc., which specialized in urban renewal, buildings for universities and hospitals, and buildings for Federal, state, and local governments. Among his projects was Washington Square Village, where modern apartment buildings replaced several blocks of older housing in Greenwich Village. He retired in 1969 and died in 1996 at the age of 96. He collected African art and the collection was acquired by Walt Disney Productions for Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla.The Tishman company went public in 1928 and was dissolved in 1978 by a third-generation president, ROBERT TISHMAN, who launched a partnership with his son-in-law, Jerry Speyer. The company was reconstituted in 1980 as a private concern under Robert's cousin, JOHN, who became chief executive officer. John Tishman, a teacher whose father died when he was four, was put in charge of construction, a job the other cousins showed no interest in. In 1965 the Tishmans got a shot at managing the construction of Madison Square Garden in New York. Such high-profile projects begat others, including the first 100-story tower, the John Hancock, in Chicago. The Tishmans were called in as consultants on the World Trade Center. When they suggested ways to cut costs, the Port Authority hired the company as the builder. Tishman continued to develop its own properties but also emphasized research. It invented body-heat detectors that turn lights on and off when people enter or leave rooms. It developed a new roofing installation with Owens Corning Fiberglas, and with U.S. Gypsum it developed an inexpensive fireproof process. During a downturn in the economy John Tishman diversified the company into services. It began managing hotels such as the St. Moritz on Central Park South. It took on financial consulting jobs. John brought in his son, Daniel R., who had been running Tishman's New England projects out of Boston in 1994, and he was put on a direct path to succeed his father. DANIEL TISHMAN (1955– ) joined the company in 1990 to lead it into the 21st century. Another Tishman, ALAN V. (1917–2004), was in charge of the leasing arm. The Tishmans were prominent in Jewish philanthropies. Among many campaigns, Alan was a vice president of UJA Federation of New York. Daniel was president of Israel Bonds' Greater New York appeal.MARGARET (PEGGY) TISHMAN (1919–2004), who was married to Alan V. Tishman, played a prominent role in American Jewish affairs. She was an organizer of the merged UJA-Federation of New York and served as its first president, from 1986 to 1989, becoming one of the first women to gain national recognition as the chief executive of a major charitable federation. She helped found the Jewish Association for the Aged (JASA) in 1968, and she developed an endowment program to support that work. She served on the boards of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Home and Hospital and was president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. As Peggy Westheimer, she graduated from Wellesley College and received a master's degree in education and psychology from Fairfield University. She gained a national reputation in 1954 when she joined the board of the Jewish Home and Hospital amid a growing debate over how society cared for its elderly, and she helped persuade the Jewish Home to build one of the country's first assisted-living residences for older adults. She also served on New York City's Commission on Heroin Addiction and twice was a delegate to the White House Conference on Aging.

Tishman notes that the company lacked the very deep financial resources needed to establish new overseas offices and maintain itself as a major market player. “It’s a very expensive proposition to open an office in the Middle East,” he said onJuly 19 in New York City.      Photo: Luke Abaffy for ENR  Daniel Tishman moves engineer AECOM further into construction services.     And with those words, the respected leader of one of construction’s most famous family-owned companies summed up why AECOM and its competitor, URS Corp., have been able to acquire planetary mass to make themselves the dual centers of a new universe of engineering megafirms. AECOM is rich with cash from earnings and a 2007 initial public offering and needs to put more of its cash to work. Together with URS, AECOM has consolidated and provided buyout capital in a field that otherwise would be starving for investors. Tishman has tremendous opportunities to export its expertise and services but lacks enough capital. With its cash and existing network of clients in 100 countries, AECOM has the means for Tishman to work in many more countries. The same forces that open international competition also cause owners to treat construction services as a commodity. That’s why the firm’s at-risk services have been as high as 40% of Tishman’s roughly $1 billion in annual revenue. Tishman has prided itself on controlling risk in a way that never exposes the firm to big cost overruns. Daniel Tishman quoted his father as saying he never wanted to find himself negotiating “on the other side of the table by taking too much risk from the owner.” That careful control of risk and exposure helps explain why fellow New Yorker and AECOM CEO John Dionisio was willing to pay $245 million—$202 million in cash, for Tishman—and to make Daniel Tishman AECOM’s vice chairman. (He will be paid an annual base salary of $600,000, plus a possible performance bonus of $550,000 in cash or shares.) A major strategic decision underlying other key acquisitions of recent years—the URS 2007 buyout of Washington Group International, for example—is whether engineering-based firms should engage in construction. Tishman inches AECOM further into construction services but within a framework of careful financial risk control. “Things could change, but clearly we didn’t want to take the risk of self-performing construction,” Dionisio said in a phone interview with ENR. “[Tishman] takes us right to the edge where we could become a player.” Tishman’s profile does appear to be different from the traditional services offered by AECOM. Tishman tends to see the industry through the eyes of a contractor, not those of an engineer. But Dionisio says Tishman takes on risk “mainly for [its] fee only.” The recession has elevated the risk of unpaid fees by financially troubled clients. According to industry sources, Tishman has escaped from any trouble involving MGM Resorts International, which is the owner of the recently opened CityCenter; Tishman Construction served as executive construction manager on the City-Center project. MGM Resorts is negotiating with its general contractor and subcontractors over what is reported to be $492 million in unpaid bills. The first word from Wall Street on the AECOM-Tishman deal is positive. Avram Fisher, an analyst who follows AECOM for financial adviser BMO Capital Markets, likes that AECOM is gaining Tishman’s “low-risk, high-margin fee-based business.” Fisher estimates that, excluding pass-through costs on a net revenue basis, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on CM fees can ran range in general from 15% to 20%, which, is “above the 9% range of AECOM’s core business,” Fisher wrote. Following this logic, wrote Fisher, “this seems to imply” that AECOM paid seven times Tishman’s earnings. Without AECOM and URS, sellers such as Tishman and Washington Group would have been unlikely to get as much for their companies, says one veteran executive unconnected to either firm. “It’s unlikely another contractor could have paid as much,” he says. One executive says Tishman’s AECOM board seat and vice chairmanship, combined with the mostly cash buyout, “seems like a great deal.” Owned by Daniel Tishman, family members and one longtime employee, Tishman Construction had in the past been both privately held by the Rockefeller Center Corp. and publicly owned before being bought back by the family. So another ownership change isn’t unfamiliar or unwelcome, even to John Tishman, Daniel’s 84-year-old father, who is said to approve of the deal. With offices in several U.S. cities, Tishman has been able to expand into Abu Dhabi. Now the company can pursue projects in more countries on the financial wings provided by AECOM.

Press Release
Daniel R. Tishman to Become NRDC Board Chair
Brings Successful Sustainable Vision to National Environmental Group

December 06, 2007





Media Contacts
Jenny Powers, 212/727-4566

 

NEW YORK (December 6th, 2007) – Green building pioneer Daniel R. Tishman has been selected as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the nation’s largest and most effective environmental organizations.  “Dan Tishman has had a lifelong commitment to a safe environment, healthy communities and robust protection of wild lands,” said Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., NRDC’s chairman for the last 17 years. “He is a long-time trustee of NRDC and proven leader in environmental protection, philanthropy and business. I am confident that leadership of NRDC’s board will be in very strong and capable hands.” 
Tishman has been a member of the NRDC board for ten years, and currently serves as a Vice Chairman of NRDC, which has 350 lawyers, scientists and other experts and an annual budget of almost $80 million. His election as chairman is effective on December 6, 2007. “The environmental challenges we face today at the local, national and global levels are unlike anything we have witnessed before,” Tishman said. “The good news is that we have more and better opportunities than ever before to remedy the problems. Cleaner energy, better business strategies and a commitment to cutting pollution are the heart of NRDC’s hard-edged advocacy and actions.” 
Tishman added that he owes much to his predecessor as chairman. “Fritz has wisely led the NRDC Board and helped the organization become the nation’s preeminent voice for the environment,” he said. 
Founded in 1970, NRDC combines the power of law, science and people to develop comprehensive solutions to the most pressing problems facing the planet. From winning passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 to this year’s path-breaking negotiations with TXU, NRDC crafts policies and strategies to stop global warming, reduce air and water pollution, and protect both human and wild habitats. NRDC is also a leading presence in China, developing pioneering strategies to lower energy use and cut dangerous emissions.  
Through its Partnership for the Earth campaign, NRDC is concentrating efforts in six major areas: curbing global warming; ending America’s dependence on oil; restoring the world’s oceans; saving endangered places and wildlife; protecting human health from toxic pollutants; and helping green China.  “Dan has taken his love of the environment and turned it into a strong business practice,” said Frances Beinecke, NRDC’s President. “This model is an increasingly crucial component of American environmental leadership today.” 
Tishman is a fourth-generation owner and leader of the well-regarded national builder and real estate developer, Tishman Realty & Construction Co., Inc., founded in 1898 in New York City.  
He earned a degree in Wildlife Ecology from Evergreen State College in Washington State and began his post-college life as a professional environmentalist working with the National Audubon Society. He helped develop the National Audubon Expedition Institute, which is now a fully accredited environmental program of Lesley University in Cambridge, MA. 
Almost two decades ago, Tishman joined the company his great-grandfather founded and has since then become a major force in propelling the green building movement to the forefront of the real estate and construction industries. He is Chairman and CEO of the firm’s building arm, the Tishman Construction Corporation. 
Tishman Construction has managed the construction of pace-setting skyscrapers, including 4 Times Square (also known as the Condé Nast Building) which is the first green skyscraper in New York City, and 7 World Trade Center, the first office tower in New York to receive gold certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. Tishman Construction is currently managing the construction of the Bank of America Tower in midtown Manhattan, the first office tower slated to earn platinum LEED certification, as well as the World Trade Center Freedom Tower, which is pursuing a Gold LEED rating. 
Tishman currently serves on the several other boards including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Sustainability Advisory Board, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Jackson Laboratory, UJA Federation of New York and the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.  Past boards he has served on include: Natural Resources Council of Maine, National Real Estate Advisory Board for the Trust for Public Land, New York League of Conservation Voters and the American Museum of Natural History Board on Bio-Diversity.

Dan Tishman





















																								By
												Candace Taylor |
												 											

 May 01, 2011 02:30PM



Dan Tishman is vice chairman at AECOM Technology Corporation, and chairman and CEO of Tishman Construction Corporation, one of the country’s largest construction companies. Founded as Tishman Realty & Construction in 1898 by Julius Tishman, the company has overseen the building of mega-projects like the original World Trade Center, Madison Square Garden and Disney World’s Epcot Center. In 2010, Tishman Construction was sold to AECOM Technology Corporation, a global engineering and design firm, for $245 million. Currently the company is construction manager for the new 3.1 million-square-foot tower at One World Trade Center, and Dan Tishman is on the board of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. A leading environmentalist, he also chairs the board of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
What is your full name?
Daniel Russell Tishman. I like to be called Dan.
When were you were born? 
I was born in July of 1955, July 3 — ruined my parents’ Fourth of July holiday.
Where did you grow up?
Upper East Side. I grew up in an apartment building that the Tishman family built in the late ’40s.
Which building? 
It’s called 885 Park Avenue. Tishman was the largest builder of residential real estate in Manhattan around World War II, [and] at that time, Park Avenue north of 57th Street was considered a wasteland. If you look at old newspaper articles, they predicted the demise of Tishman for making such a foolhardy decision as to build in an area where nobody would want to buy an apartment.
As a kid, you wanted to be a scientist. Did you know you would end up joining the family business instead? 
I absolutely did not know. I grew up as a product of the construction industry. … Some of my fondest memories were of walking the World Trade Center site when that was being originally developed. But I was also very interested in the out-of-doors. So I went off to college and took a lot of science courses.
Where did you go to college? 
Evergreen State College in Washington State. I ended up being offered a job by the National Audubon Society to help them develop educational programs.
So what changed? 
I had a bit of an epiphany. … I just decided that if I didn’t, at that point in my life, take a stab at coming into the family business, then I probably wouldn’t, and I might regret that.
Did your family pressure you to join them? 
My dad, who was running the business at the time, his philosophy was to go out, do your own thing, and the family business will always be there. He had been a math schoolteacher … after he came out of the Navy.
I see a Red Sox hat in one of your family photos. 
Well, my wife, Sheryl, is from Maine.
How long have you been married? 
This will be 27 years. We met at a ski lodge in Killington, Vt., during Christmas break. We knew each other eight years before we got married.
But you’re still a New York fan? 
I am, and we’re a split family. Both of my sons [ages 14 and 19], unfortunately for me, related to the Red Sox and not the New York teams.
Where do you live? 
In Westchester County, in Bedford. And we have a farm in Maine that was for a long time the largest commercial llama farm in New England.
That is quite a claim to fame. Why is it no longer the largest? 
We don’t have a breeding program anymore. They’re just pets. We also grow our own organic vegetables, most of our food, [and] we raise chickens and pigs and sheep and have about 400 acres of managed forests.
Do you slaughter the pigs and chickens yourself? 
No, but I love to eat them.
You are distantly related to the founders of Tishman Speyer, which spun off from Tishman Realty & Construction in the 1970s. Does it bother you when people mix the two companies up?
No, I think we’re used to it — they’ve confused us for so long.
Since selling the business to AECOM, has it been hard to give up control? 
I’ve quite enjoyed getting to know the public company life.
What is your greatest career accomplishment so far? 
I would say in my career, the greatest thing I’ve done is be involved for the last 10 years with the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site. You know, when the World Trade Center came down, Larry Silverstein called my father literally the next day and said, “John, we’re going to rebuild.”
What has that experience been like? 
Oh, it’s been very emotional. I sat here in my office and watched the towers come down on the TV with my father sitting at my side.
Could you see it from here? 
You could see the dust cloud.
Your father, John, is now 85. Is he fully retired? 
We don’t use the R-word around my father. He likes to do special projects; there are usually two or three that he’s involved with.
How did your dad react to the attacks? 
The World Trade Center was one of three or four projects that in a 50-year career he always went back to as one of the centerpieces of what he had done. So to see them disappear for him was very emotional. But then from that … came a real dedication to want to have as much a hand in the putting back of what was destroyed as we could, because [we] felt that was the most important thing we could do to say to the world: “Listen, you might be able to knock us down, but you can’t knock us out.”
Do you have any regrets about the way your career has gone?
There are moments when I think maybe a life as a scientist would have been a little less stressful, less responsibility. But I like running things. I probably regret not being able to say no — I tend to get myself a little overly involved in things. But I don’t really have many regrets.
