Home  >  Investments  >  Total Portfolio Management  >  Commonfund Strategic Solutions 









Our approach to the outsourced chief investment office model begins with an obsessive focus on investments and performance.  From there, we take a total institutional approach, addressing wide-ranging factors that extend well beyond investment management. When you work with Commonfund, we begin by understanding your institution as a whole, not just your investment portfolio.
We function as an extension of your organization's own internal offices. We can be a fiduciary partner as well as a resource for all your critical needs, such as:


Working collaboratively with you on all aspects of portfolio management, including investment policy review


Asset allocation, portfolio construction, monitoring, rebalancing, risk management and reporting


Taking accountability for investment performance¹


Proactively communicating with you on important issues impacting your investments


Assisting in any required education to your board and/or investment committee


Providing a dedicated account management team to assist in audit, tax and other items


We have been working with nonprofit investors to provide total portfolio solutions for over 40 years and as a discretionary OCIO for 15 years. Over the years we have learned that building a partnership is critical to the success of your organization, and distinctly different than a traditional consulting relationship. Once you decide to pursue the OCIO model it is important to research providers thoroughly and ask the right questions during the evaluation process. Based on our experience and best practices, this article on how to write your RFP (Request For Proposal) may prove helpful.
