ELLIS ENGINEERS NEW APPOINTMENT

 16.11.15

 

The world’s leading cable cleat manufacturer, Ellis has appointed Stephen Walton to its product design team.
Stephen, a mechanical design engineer with 15-years of experience, will work alongside technical director, Andy Booth and trainee design engineer, Harry Taylor at a time when new product development is very much at the forefront of Ellis’ thinking.
Richard Shaw, managing director of Ellis, said: “Everything we do at Ellis is geared towards bettering the business – both in terms of sales and reputation. New product development has always been something we have been good at, but we want it to be something we excel at. And do so in a manner that sets us well apart from the competition.”
“Appointing someone with the experience and ideas that Stephen brings to the table is the perfect step in ensuring this aim quickly becomes a reality.”
Prior to moving to Ellis, Stephen had worked in a number of roles at Forum Energy Technologies (formerly Perry Slingsby Systems) in Kirbymoorside, North Yorkshire. Starting as a graduate engineer he moved up through the ranks to become global tooling manager for a division that enjoyed 100 per cent growth within two years of his appointment.
Commenting on his new role at Ellis, Stephen said: “After several years in the same position I was eager for a new and exciting challenge, and Ellis presented exactly that. It is a company with a big reputation and a host of big ideas, and I’m looking forward to playing my part in taking these ideas and developing them into the kind of products that will only serve to enhance Ellis’ reputation and its position as the undoubted marker leader.”
