Above table reports Labor Condition Application(LCA) for H1B visa and Labor Certification(LC) for green card filed by Roundwood Asset Management Llc. The data only indicates the number of applications filed by Roundwood Asset Management Llc. It does not mean that Roundwood Asset Management Llc actually got the visa and hired the workers.Our LCA data includes LCA submitted for not only new employment, but also continuation or change in previously approved employment, new concurrent employment, change in employer and amended petition. Usually, only LCA for new employment needs H1B Visa quota if it is not cap-exempt. Roundwood Asset Management Llc has applied for 2 LC and LCA from fiscal year 2014 to 2016. But this does not mean they really hired 2 foreign workers during this period. The visa applications might have been denied. When an employee renews or transfers his H1B visa or change work location under some circumstances, he will also file a new LCA application. Department of Labor(DOL) typically certifies more than 3 times the number of foreign work requests than the number of H1B visas issued by USCIS. So there is no one to one relationship between the number of workers certified by the DOL and the number of H1B work visas issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
