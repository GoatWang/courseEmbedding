Executive Interview – Accuray – Kelly Londy 




Kelly Londy, EVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Accuray
Keynote Topic: Sales Transformation: From Selling Technology to Building Customer Loyalty

Video Transcript:
Gary Tubridy: I am here with Kelly Londy, EVP and Chief Commercial Officer at Accuray. Kelly, welcome to the Forum.
Kelly Londy:Hi.
GT: Thank you for joining us.
KL: Thank you for inviting me. It is my pleasure.
GT: Well, it is great to have you here and I think perhaps to start, why don’t we talk a little bit about Accuray and your role at Accuray. Give us a little background.
KL: Sure. I am the Chief Commercial Officer and my job really has anything to do with what touches a customer. Anybody that actually interacts with a customer, falls within my purview of the company. Accuray is the company. We develop, manufacture and distribute radiation oncology equipment. Our main customers are hospitals and physician groups that treat radiation oncology patients of one kind or another.
GT: Tell me about who the customer is at the customer?
KL: That sounds like an easy question and it is actually very complex. It is a wide variety of people at our customers. They are the radiation oncologists, the surgeons, the neurosurgeons, the dosimetrists, the hospital executives, the CEO and CFO. It is the marketing teams at a hospital, as they are trying to make their brand established. It is the insurance companies, so the payers actually become our customers and eventually it is the patient. We do a lot of direct to patient outreach as well as patients are getting more and more informed in this digital age, they can look up anything on the internet. Really the patients become the end decider of what kind of care they will get.
GT: That sounds like an ecosystem that has become a lot more complex over the recent years.
KL: It has, especially in a global company. We are very global and different cancer rates are different in different countries. Different cultures look at how patient treatment happens differently and at different economic spheres, whether you are in Europe or you are in Russia or you are in Hong Kong, patient care still needs to get delivered. A very different look at how it goes to market now.
GT: Tell me a little bit about the value you deliver to these customers in an ecosystem that had us change in recent years.
KL: Sure. Our value proposition is around delivering the maximum treatment options to a patient that really allows for quality of life and quantity of life. The throughput, the look of how to make it easier for the end users, as well, has really been important as we are a changing the model on how we go to market. It used to be that we really focused on the academic, key opinion leader, industry. Over the last few years, we have really been driving to solutions that make it much more main stream which is great for hospitals to be able to provide that kind of equipment to patients everywhere.
GT: The role of the sales force has probably changed in delivering that kind of value. Can you speak to that a little bit?
KL: Sure and we are right in the middle still of a sales transformation. As we have moved from a technology driven sales force to a customer loyalty and customer focused sales force, it really has changed everything in our organization. Moving everybody from finance and legal and supply chain and the sales force and the field engineers, everybody being focused around what is best for the customer really makes it that you have to set up tools, thought process, communication internally and externally that really allows you to have profitable growth and be customer focused at the same time.
GT: When you took the reins at Accuray, you had some challenges. Tell us a little bit about that turnaround and the way the numbers are today.
KL: Well, it is a process. I have been with Accuray now three years and we had just completed an acquisition of a competitive product and so we completed the acquisition, but had not gone through the integration yet. We are now through that, we have integrated the sales teams, the engineering teams. We have payroll coming out of one paycheck system now, which really says you are through the integration. Now it is really more about how do we drive making sure that we have a good value proposition for our customers? That the products are complimentary to each other, that a lot of customers now are actually buying bulk products which really shows that they are complimentary to each other as you are going through the integration. Figuring out how do you actually now go from here with the integration completed being one company, two great products, rather than two great companies competing to really being able to maximize how customers utilize the equipment and that is the real next challenge that we are working on.
GT: What is in store for 2015?
KL: Well, it is a pretty exciting year at Accuray right now. We publicly have disclosed that we will be profitable this year which after the acquisition, this is a pretty good turnaround financially for us. We have got the processes in place that are really stabilizing the growth and underpinnings so that we can continue to grow and have the underpinning in place to make it happen. Our key opinion leaders, our install base globally, is really growing. We are looking at how do we maximize that for our customers to continue to stay on a platform of evolution, rather than having to buy a new system every time they want to grow their clinical capabilities.
GT: Wow. It is a great story Kelly. Congratulations.
KL: Thank you. It has been a fun ride.
GT: Well, thank you and thanks for joining us here.
KL: It is my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.

Lumicell Appoints Kelly Londy as Chief Executive Officer, Announces 
      Additional Financing






July 12, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WELLESLEY, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Directors of Lumicell, Inc., a leader in the field of 
      image-guided cancer surgery, announced today the appointment of Kelly 
      Londy as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. 
      W. David Lee, Founder of Lumicell, has moved into the role of President 
      and Chief Scientific Officer.
    


      Dr. Andrey Zarur, Chairman of the Board of Lumicell, said “We are 
      extremely excited to welcome Kelly to Lumicell. Kelly was chosen as CEO 
      for her passion for innovation, ability to optimize business strategy, 
      and her overarching desire to make the Lumicell technology available to 
      patients around the globe. With over 25 years of experience in the 
      medical device field, the Board is confident in her ability to lead 
      Lumicell on their mission to change the landscape of cancer surgery.”
    

      Lumicell also announced an additional closing of its Series C financing, 
      securing an aggregate total of $13.5 million. Londy’s appointment, 
      together with this additional funding, will support Lumicell’s pivotal 
      trial in breast cancer this year and development of additional cancer 
      applications.
    

      “Our team at Lumicell is developing a truly revolutionary intraoperative 
      margin assessment system that gives surgeons real-time visual feedback 
      of residual cancer in the tumor bed,” said Kelly Londy, CEO of Lumicell. 
      “I am honored to lead this team as we strive to greatly improve surgical 
      outcomes and possibly remove the need for repeat cancer surgeries.”
    

      Every year approximately 300,000 cancer lumpectomies take place in the 
      United States. More than 60,000 of the patients who undergo a lumpectomy 
      must endure a second surgery, or re-excision, due to positive margins 
      discovered on final histopathology examination. Second surgeries may 
      increase discomfort, add emotional and cosmetic expenses to the patient, 
      and may cost the healthcare system close to $1 billion annually. Londy 
      said “I am passionate about the battle against cancer, and especially 
      breast cancer, where removing the whole tumor the first time can have 
      dramatic impact to the patient, surgeons and health care system. I 
      believe Lumicell will provide a new platform to surgeons around the 
      world that will allow patients to have the highest level of care 
      possible.”
    

      Londy was most recently the Chief Operating Officer at Accuray 
      Incorporated, where she provided end-to-end leadership across all 
      customer facing activities, from product development through customer 
      adoption, education, and service. Previously, she held leadership roles 
      at GE Healthcare and Philips Healthcare.
    

About Lumicell, Inc.


      Lumicell is a leader in the field of image-guided cancer surgery. The 
      company is developing a revolutionary intraoperative margin assessment 
      system that gives surgeons real-time visual feedback of residual cancer 
      in the tumor bed. Lumicell’s surgical system includes a margin-targeted 
      optical contrast agent and a novel hand-held imaging device with 
      exquisite single-cell detection. The unprecedented ability to see and 
      remove all cancer cells during the initial surgery has the potential to 
      significantly improve surgical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by 
      eliminating the need for repeat surgeries. Lumicell is investigating its 
      cavity assessment system in patients undergoing surgery for breast 
      cancer, sarcomas, and gastrointestinal cancer. Additional future 
      indications may include surgeries for lung, prostate, ovarian, and brain 
      cancers. For more information, please visit www.lumicell.com.

Lumicell Appoints Kelly Londy as Chief Executive Officer, Announces Additional Financing
 
Wellesley, Mass., July 12, 2017 – The Board of Directors of Lumicell, Inc., a leader in the field of image-guided cancer surgery, announced today the appointment of Kelly Londy as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. W. David Lee, Founder of Lumicell, has moved into the role of President and Chief Scientific Officer.
 
Dr. Andrey Zarur, Chairman of the Board of Lumicell, said “We are extremely excited to welcome Kelly to Lumicell. Kelly was chosen as CEO for her passion for innovation, ability to optimize business strategy, and her overarching desire to make the Lumicell technology available to patients around the globe. With over 25 years of experience in the medical device field, the Board is confident in her ability to lead Lumicell on their mission to change the landscape of cancer surgery.”
 
Lumicell also announced an additional closing of its Series C financing, securing an aggregate total of $13.5 million. Londy’s appointment, together with this additional funding, will support Lumicell’s pivotal trial in breast cancer this year and development of additional cancer applications.
 
“Our team at Lumicell is developing a truly revolutionary intraoperative margin assessment system that gives surgeons real-time visual feedback of residual cancer in the tumor bed,” said Kelly Londy, CEO of Lumicell. “I am honored to lead this team as we strive to greatly improve surgical outcomes and possibly remove the need for repeat cancer surgeries.”
 
Every year approximately 300,000 cancer lumpectomies take place in the United States. More than 60,000 of the patients who undergo a lumpectomy must endure a second surgery, or re-excision, due to positive margins discovered on final histopathology examination. Second surgeries may increase discomfort, add emotional and cosmetic expenses to the patient, and may cost the healthcare system close to $1 billion annually. Londy said “I am passionate about the battle against cancer, and especially breast cancer, where removing the whole tumor the first time can have dramatic impact to the patient, surgeons and health care system. I believe Lumicell will provide a new platform to surgeons around the world that will allow patients to have the highest level of care possible.”
 
Londy was most recently the Chief Operating Officer at Accuray Incorporated, where she provided end-to-end leadership across all customer facing activities, from product development through customer adoption, education, and service. Previously, she held leadership roles at GE Healthcare and Philips Healthcare.
 
About Lumicell, Inc.
 
Lumicell is a leader in the field of image-guided cancer surgery. The company is developing a revolutionary intraoperative margin assessment system that gives surgeons real-time visual feedback of residual cancer in the tumor bed. Lumicell’s surgical system includes a margin-targeted optical contrast agent and a novel hand-held imaging device with exquisite single-cell detection. The unprecedented ability to see and remove all cancer cells during the initial surgery has the potential to significantly improve surgical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by eliminating the need for repeat surgeries. Lumicell is investigating its cavity assessment system in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer, sarcomas, and gastrointestinal cancer. Additional future indications may include surgeries for lung, prostate, ovarian, and brain cancers. For more information, please visit www.lumicell.com.
