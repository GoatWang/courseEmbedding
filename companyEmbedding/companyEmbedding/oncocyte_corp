Products
OncoCyte Corporation is focused on developing diagnostics to address the unmet needs in the detection and screening of lung, breast and bladder cancers.
Current imaging diagnostic procedures in screening lung, breast and bladder cancer are not meeting the needs of health care providers, patients or payers in that they often produce indeterminate diagnoses due to the high level of false positives.
These indeterminate diagnoses can result in:

Physician uncertainty on whether downstream procedures are needed
Patient angst and concern about whether or not they have cancer
Unnecessary downstream procedures adding incremental costs to health care spend (e.g., bronchoscopies, cystoscopies, biopsies).


As molecular diagnostics evolve from tissue based to liquid biopsy based, fewer downstream procedures will be required resulting in cost savings, earlier diagnosis and decreased risks to the patient.
OncoCyte is developing proprietary non-invasive tests using liquid biopsies (blood and urine) to help physicians improve the screening protocols for lung, breast and bladder cancer patients. OncoCyte’s portfolio of pipeline products detect biomarkers that are associated with specific types of cancer (lung, breast and bladder) to help physicians by confirming false positives to improve the standard of care and reduce overall health care spend.
The Wistar Institute, OncoCyte’s research partner, presented interim clinical data for lung cancer at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) international conference in May of 2015.

OncoCyte presented interim clinical study data for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in April of 2015 demonstrating a high of sensitivity and specificity in the detection of urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer.
