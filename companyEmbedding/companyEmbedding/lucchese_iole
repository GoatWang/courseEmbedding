About Lucchese



 The Lucchese™ Bootmaker story starts in 1880 when Sam Lucchese Sr. and his brothers came to America. He was just 17 years old at the time, but Lucchese knew he wanted to be a boot maker. Just three years later, the Lucchese Boot Company was born in San Antonio, Texas. In 1960 the founder´s grandson and namesake took over the family business and decided to rethink the art of boot making. Sam Lucchese Jr.´s fascination and understanding of the human foot inspired him to create a boot design that fit like no other. Although Lucchese´s one-of-a-kind boot's last design required more skill and time, the result was a boot that quickly gained national recognition for its extraordinary comfort, quality and fit. 
No other boot fits the human foot like a Lucchese™ Bootmaker boot, thanks to their original design and meticulous construction. From the exclusive "twisted cone last" design and the careful selection and cutting of the finest grade of leather, to the hand-drive lemon wood pegs and meticulous finishing of a boot. Each step is considered critical to the finished product. The boot designs may demand more money, time and skill, but when you slip your foot into a Lucchese™ Bootmaker boot, you'll know why we insist on only the finest. 
Every Lucchese™ Bootmaker boot is hand inspected twice. In virtually every procedure during the production on a Lucchese boot, human hands are relied upon to complete the task to near-perfection. Every inch of a Lucchese boot is made of the finest grade of leathers. Slip your foot into a Lucchese and experience comfort you never thought possible.

The robin's egg blue Lucchese Robyn is the perfect color for a summer boot. I works with white jeans, capris and skirts. It works with coral and red, it works with an amazing array of colors and the fringe plus the simple feather add a bit of design punch. The style fits like it was custom made for my finicky feet and the arch support is wonderful. A great choice!

These boots are drop dead gorgeous. The pictures don't do them justice.
I'm 5'9" and 140 lbs, with a shoe size of 9, a 14" calf. I ordered these in an 8.5, and the fit is perfect with regular socks. I could have gone down another half size if I wanted to wear thin socks. These hit right at the widest point of my calf, which is a very flattering height for skinny jeans, leggings, skirts, and shorts. I anticipate they will drop about 1" when fully broken in. The foot bed feels true to width. The color is just beautiful, a rich, dark red that goes with just about anything. I was afraid the red would be too bold, but it's subtle enough to match most outfits, and looks especially fabulous with a dark olive green.
As far as comfort, these are pretty reasonable for fashion footwear. They form to the foot well, with no pinching or crowding. I wanted something to wear for dressy occasions that would be more comfortable than heels, and these fit the bill nicely. I normally wear minimalist footwear, so while these aren't quite on that level, they're very comfortable for what they are.
Overall, I would highly recommend these boots. They're gorgeous, versatile, and more comfortable than the average stylish shoe. Love them.

These boots look great and fit perfect. Most of the boots I have purchased were purchased 1/2 size larger than I wear in regular shoes. Only the Ostrich boots fit perfect using my regular shoe size; I have no idea why that is.

Very nice looking boot but not as comfortable as I'd hoped. Only worn a few times though. Expect that with additional wear and break in comfort will improve. Sharp looking boot.

This shoe looks elegant and adventuresome, but seems oddly built with an uncomfortable ankle that doesn't allow much freedom for the foot.

I have a weakness for Luccheses and so these added to my collection. They are beautiful and of course comfortable right out of the box. The red is brighter than it looks on the picture so they really stand out. They really get noticed but I like that I can walk around comfortably all day. I love all my Luccheses! Thanks to Zappos's for carrying small sizes (5) because otherwise I would be shoeless and worse Lucchese-less.

OK boot - probably somewhat overpriced for the quality. Very narrow tops - if you calf is even slightly larger than average, you will not be able to fit into this boot. I fit nicely into a pair of American made Lucchese boots, so my calves are big but not huge. These are going back.

OK, so this is my 2nd review on these boots after wearing them for the first time today(I shouldn't have rushed the 1st review). These boots are incredible! Instant comfort right out of the box. I first bought a pair of cheaper boots and they dug into my ankles when I walked and the heel slip was so bad that I almost couldn't walk(returned them) These fit perfectly, like they used my foot for the mold.(very true to size) Yes, they are very distressed, very marked and creased where my ankle and toes bend but that's what makes them so comfortable. I don't think I could buy any other boot after wearing my Lucchese. Love these boots!

These booties are beautiful!! The leather is soft and supple, with a pointed toe. The heels are low and comfortable, with a nicely padded foot bed. The grey braided trim around the ankle provides the perfect finishing touch!! I love them!! Thanks, Zappos!!! You did it again!!

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Zappos.com has received 4.67 out of 5 stars based on 8 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
