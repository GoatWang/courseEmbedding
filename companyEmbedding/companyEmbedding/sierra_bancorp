The Bank currently conducts business through 34 full-service branch offices, a loan production office, an online branch, a real estate industries center, an agricultural credit center, an SBA center, and several offsite ATMs. It provides a full range of retail and commercial banking services in California's South Central Valley and neighboring communities, the Central Coast, and select Southern California locations including Ventura County and the Santa Clarita Valley. The Bank’s growth has primarily been organic, but includes three acquisitions: Coast National Bank in 2016, Santa Clara Valley Bank in 2014, and Sierra National Bank in 2000.
