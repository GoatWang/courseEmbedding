Liz Tammaro: So we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast. We're going to get started with our first question and, Jim, I'm going to give this one to you. So it makes a lot of sense before we get started, let's define what is an ETF. Jim Rowley: Simply put, an ETF is an exchange-traded fund, right− It's a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities. Investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund. The fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand. Furthermore, and I should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors, whether it's an index in particular or a market strategy. And when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of ETFs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. And that's the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate. So for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and ETFs, they're overwhelmingly similar actually. Liz Tammaro: And even thinking about that, we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an ETF or, sorry, even vice versa, ETF versus mutual fund. And even maybe what are some of the disadvantages. Jim Rowley: I'll take that because I think I don't necessarily like the word disadvantage. I think differences is maybe the more appropriate term. And we just addressed some of the similarities between ETFs and mutual funds, so it's maybe more important to know what are the actual differences. And really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds, right− We're talking about exchange-traded funds. ETF investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities, and the price that they get is a tradeable market price. Mutual fund investors, on the other hand, they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but it's back and forth with the fund itself and they get an end-of-day NAV. So we think about all the similarities and, again, sometimes there's a discussion about how different they are; but, really, the differences come down to those two items. It's trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and it's trading at a market price rather than getting the end-of-day NAV. Jim Rowley: I think we actually have a great way to illustrate that. I think we have a chart that addresses that point that Doug was talking about that ETFs are overwhelming. They just happen to be index funds. And when the chart comes up, a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios. But instead of breaking them down by ETF versus mutual fund, we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into ETF and mutual fund. And when you see the expense ratios, you see that given an indexing strategy, whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF, the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies, whether it's an ETF or a mutual fund. So it has a lot more to do with whether or not it's an indexing strategy than whether or not it's an ETF or a mutual fund. Liz Tammaro: And similar to that question, we have another one that's come in from Bruce asking about how easy is it to buy and/or sell an ETF versus a mutual fund− Jim Rowley: A lot of moving parts in that question because I think the default has always been mutual funds because they've been around longer. So it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars. You put your orders in in dollar terms. You're happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a 4 PM NAV. You might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you. With an ETF, investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account. And now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares, mutually speaking. There's no fractionals there. When you put your order in shares, you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount. So, you know, the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing. Important information All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, or other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing. Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

I joined after six years of consulting, thinking I would be here for only a couple of years before moving on to bigger and better things. 16 years later and I am still here, working along >15k other friends who are equally passionate about making a difference and doing so with the highest ethics and character.ConsWe are a very rational workforce, and data is critical in ensuring we are on track to achieving our objectives.

It can be tough getting your foot in the door in the securities industry, and Vanguard is just low-paying enough that it doesn't attract all that many people. If you can afford the record-breaking lows in terms of industry compensation, stick out a year for your licenses and book it.Lots of folks will list this as a 'con,' but Vanguard's culture really does come off as inclusive, friendly, and caring. The company promotes this happy, feel-good kinda hugbox that pushes even the most curmudgeonly people into being supportive and affable. Benefits are top-notch, and a good deal of your co-workers are going to be kind and thoughtful. Really lovely people were working at the Scottsdale location when I worked there. This includes some of the management, too; some of the team leaders are absolute assets to the company.The operational issues with Vanguard are so glaring it is incredibly easy to convince my clients with assets in Vanguard to defect.The investment products and funds Vanguard has to offer are some of the industry's best. John Bogle is an absolute genius. McNabb's kind of a twerp.ConsCompensation is pitiful. Recognition of work of any caliber is hard to come by. Employees who are top performers get their name published in an e-bulletin board (and maybe even a Harkins movie pass for two!). Employees who are poor performers/just plain incompetent are kept on payroll.All employees are kept in the dark.There are managers and associates in literally every department who have absolutely no goddamn idea what they're doing, even after years of being in that department. It would be incredible if it weren't so sad.Advice to ManagementFull disclosure here: I believe Vanguard is an amazing company, and its accomplishments are incredible. I really wanted to keep working with it and see it grow, hopefully one day watch my own suggestions and systems contribute to its success.That being said, let your associates grow. Make the ladder more obvious and provide more incentive to climb that ladder.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (23) Vanguard Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Vanguard 2017-06-05 21:01 PDT Jul 3, 2017 Helpful (2)"Promotions are difficult"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Participant Services Representative in Scottsdale, AZFormer Employee - Participant Services Representative in Scottsdale, AZI worked at Vanguard full-time (More than 3 years)Prosbenefits are really good hereConsphone calls are grueling and never endingShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Vanguard Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Vanguard 2017-07-03 09:53 PDT May 19, 2017 Helpful (12)"Mediocre"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Client Relationship Specialist in Scottsdale, AZFormer Employee - Client Relationship Specialist in Scottsdale, AZDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Vanguard (More than a year)Pros37.5 Hour work week, free lunches when busy, 401k, affordable health coverage, genuine people, paid series 7/63 trainingConsRepetitive/stressful call environmentLunches reduced without your say for busy timesAsked to put in feedback for the company but never saw a return/improvementTimed bathroom breaksMicro managedUninformed managementAdvice to ManagementKeep your word and listen to the front line's advice.

It is every seasoned professionals worst nightmare to have a young ,inexperienced manager with no real "leadership" experience, live out her learning curve at your expense. I am basically teaching (the hard way) my leader to lead and not manage. She has zero people skills and covers up her lack of professionalism by "talking the talk". If this is your fear DO NOT COME TO VANGUARD!Systems and processes are a nightmare for clients. It is remarkable that they stay with us like they do with how severe the errors are.Advice to ManagementHave a long hard look at statements regarding your leadership choices in these reviews. Until there is an epiphany and action is taken, seasoned professionals like myself with find it extremely easy to move clients away from Vanguard once I have obtained the designation currently in progress and work for a competitor.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (12) Vanguard Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Vanguard 2017-05-22 18:42 PDT Showing 286 of 1,757 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Scottsdale > Vanguard RSS Feed</>Embed Vanguard Careers Vanguard is passionate about people and helping others.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
