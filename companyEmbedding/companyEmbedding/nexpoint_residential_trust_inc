He has served on several boards of directors of public and private companies, including staffing company MPS Group, Inc., which was sold to Adecco Group for $1.3 billion in 2009. Dr. Laffer was previously a consultant to Secretary of the Treasury William Simon, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz.

Laffer is credited with advancing the concept of supply-side economics when he drew a curve on the back of a napkin at a dinner meeting, showing that government tax receipts can sometimes increase when federal income tax rates are lowered. The Laffer Curve and supply-side economics served as the foundation for Reaganomics in the 1980s when Dr. Laffer served on the President’s Economic Policy Advisory Board from 1981 to 1989. Dr. Laffer has been recognized for his achievements in economics, having been featured in Time Magazine’s 1999 cover story, The Century’s Greatest Minds, for inventing the Laffer Curve, which Time deemed one of a few of the advances that powered this extraordinary century.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

DALLAS, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. (NYSE:   NXRT) reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.








Third Quarter 2016 Highlights

NXRT paid a third quarter dividend of $0.206 per share of NXRT common stock on September 30, 2016. 
On November 7, 2016, NXRT's board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.220 per share of NXRT common stock, a $0.014 per share, or 6.8% increase, over the prior quarter's dividend. The dividend is payable on December 30, 2016 to stockholders of record on December 15, 2016. 
Net income totaled $8.8 million, or earnings of $0.33 per common share, which included $9.6 million of gain on sales of four properties, Colonial Forest, Park at Blanding, Willowdale Crossings and Jade Park, and depreciation and amortization of $8.7 million, compared to net income of $16.6 million, or earnings of $0.69 per common share, for the second quarter of 2016, which included $16.4 million of gain on sales of three properties, Meridian, Park at Regency, and Mandarin Reserve, and depreciation and amortization of $8.1 million. 
FFO¹, net of four dispositions made during the quarter, totaled $6.9 million, or $0.32 per common share, compared to $7.2 million, or $0.34 per common share, for the second quarter of 2016. 
AFFO¹ totaled $16.2 million, or $0.76 per common share, which included $8.0 million, the Company's share of gain on sales of four properties. This compared to $22.5 million, or $1.06 per common share, for the second quarter of 2016, which included $14.8 million, the Company's share of gain on sales of three properties. 
NOI¹ was $17.1 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $17.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. 
Total revenues were $33.1 million for the quarter, compared to $33.7 million for the second quarter of 2016. 
Same Store total revenues, NOI and occupancy increased 10.2%, 12.8%, and 48 basis points to 93.9%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
The weighted average effective monthly rent per unit across all 36 properties held as of September 30, 2016, consisting of 11,626 units, was $848, while physical occupancy was 93.6%. 
NXRT completed upgrades on 538 units and leased 569 upgraded units during the third quarter of 2016, achieving a 21.2% ROI on those units. Since inception, we have completed 4,118 upgrades and achieved a $85 average monthly rental increase per unit, equating to a 21.2% ROI on all units leased through September 30, 2016. 
On June 15, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30.0 million of the Company's common stock. During the third quarter, NXRT purchased 76,214 shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $1,435,000, or $18.83 per share. As of November 9, 2016, the Company had purchased a total of 233,346 shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of approximately $4,279,000, or $18.34 per share. 
As mentioned above, the Company completed the disposition of four properties during the quarter: Colonial Forest and Park at Blanding in Jacksonville, Florida, Willowdale Crossings in Frederick, Maryland, and Jade Park in Daytona Beach, Florida for a combined $69.7 million of gross sale proceeds. The Company recognized a $9.6 million gain on the sales while the investments returned an approximate cumulative levered IRR of 17.27% and an approximate equity multiple of 1.39x. The exit from the entire Jacksonville portfolio yielded a 31.5% IRR and 1.62x equity multiple over a 24 month hold period.

1AFFO, FFO and NOI are non-GAAP measures. For reconciliations of AFFO, FFO and NOI to net income and a discussion of why we consider these non-GAAP measures useful, see the "Definitions and Reconciliations" section of this release.
"Having fixed $400 million, or 73.2% of our floating rate debt (swapping LIBOR for 0.9956% for five years), successfully disposing of seven properties, buying back approximately $4.3 million of the Company's stock and redeploying capital into more attractive opportunities in West Palm Beach and Phoenix, we feel it is an appropriate time to increase our quarterly dividend and target a payout ratio of 60 to 65% of our annual funds from operations (FFO). We remain bullish on the internal growth prospects within our existing portfolio and investment opportunities in workforce housing across our core markets and look forward to continuing to deliver value and results for our residents and our stockholders," stated, NXRT Chairman and President, Jim Dondero.
Third Quarter Financial Results
The Company recorded net income in the third quarter of 2016 of $8.8 million, which included gain on sales of real estate of $9.6 million and depreciation and amortization of $8.7 million. This compared to a net loss of $(0.9) million for the third quarter of 2015, which included depreciation and amortization of $9.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, NXRT had net income of $25.7 million, which included $25.9 million of gain on sales of real estate and $26.4 million of depreciation and amortization. This compared to net loss of $(9.0) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which included depreciation and amortization of $30.8 million.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, FFO was $6.9 million, or $0.32 per common share, and AFFO was $16.2 million, or $0.76 per common share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, FFO was $22.7 million, or $1.07 per common share, and AFFO was $48.0 million, or $2.25 per common share.
The change in the Company's net income (loss) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015, primarily relate to strong year-over-year performance of our same store portfolio and the disposition of four properties during the third quarter of 2016, as compared to no dispositions during the third quarter of 2015.
Same Store Properties Operating Results 
The Company's Same Store property pool at September 30, 2016 included 32 properties totaling 10,292 units, or approximately 88.5% of the Company's 11,626 units. These Same Store properties represented approximately 85.7% of NXRT's NOI for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.
Same Store total revenues, NOI, and occupancy increased 10.2%, 12.8%, and 48 basis points to 93.9%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015.   
Disposition of Assets 
During the third quarter, the Company completed the disposition of Colonial Forest and Park at Blanding in Jacksonville, Florida, Willowdale Crossings in Frederick, Maryland, and Jade Park in Daytona Beach, Florida for a combined $69.7 million of gross sale proceeds, generating an approximate cumulative levered IRR of 17.27% and an approximate equity multiple of 1.39x. Net proceeds from the dispositions were used to retire existing debt, buy back stock and to partially fund the Company's acquisition of The Colonnade (through a 1031 like-kind exchange of Willowdale Crossings) subsequent to quarter end. The exit from the Jacksonville portfolio yielded a 31.5% IRR and 1.62x equity multiple over a 24 month hold period.
Value-Add Programs
For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we completed full and partial interior rehabs on 538 and 696 units, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we completed full and partial interior rehabs on 1,475 and 1,543 units, respectively.
The following table sets forth a summary of our capital expenditures related to our value-add program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

Bridge Facility
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid down the entire $29.0 million of principal on its bridge facility, which was funded with $18.0 million of the Company's share of proceeds, net of distributions to noncontrolling interests, from the sales of Park at Regency and Mandarin Reserve, $9.0 million of proceeds drawn under the Company's Credit Facility and $2.0 million of cash on hand. The Bridge Facility was retired on August 2, 2016.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements
In order to fix a portion of, and mitigate the risk associated with, the Company's floating rate indebtedness (without incurring substantial prepayment penalties or defeasance costs typically associated with fixed rate indebtedness when repaid early or refinanced), the Company, through the OP, has entered into four interest rate swap transactions with KeyBank (the "Counterparty") with a combined notional amount of $400.0 million. The interest rate swaps effectively replace the floating interest rate (one-month LIBOR) with a weighted average fixed rate of 0.9956%. During the term of these interest rate swap agreements, the Company is required to make monthly fixed rate payments of 0.9956%, on a weighted average basis, on the notional amounts, while the Counterparty is obligated to make monthly floating rate payments based on one-month LIBOR to the Company referencing the same notional amounts. The Company has designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.

Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on management's current expectations, assumptions and beliefs. Forward-looking statements can often be identified by words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend" and similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected dividend rates, the delivery of value and results to our residents and stockholders and NXRT's guidance for financial results for the full year 2016. They are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and anticipated sales of properties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements and are encouraged to review the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for a more complete discussion of the risks and other factors that could affect any forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, NXRT does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changing circumstances or any other reason after the date of this press release.
Definitions and Reconciliations
This press release includes analysis of funds from operations, or FFO, adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, and net operating income, or NOI, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures of performance. These non-GAAP measures should be used as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP. For a more complete discussion of FFO, AFFO, and NOI, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our other filings with the SEC. 
This press release also includes an analysis of our Same Store properties, which are defined as those that are stabilized and comparable for both the current and the prior reporting year. Same Store analysis for the third quarter of 2016 includes 32 properties totaling 10,292 units, or approximately 88.5% of the Company's 11,626 units.
FFO and AFFO 
We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges. We compute FFO attributable to common stockholders in accordance with NAREIT's definition. Our presentation differs slightly in that we begin with net income (loss) loss before adjusting for noncontrolling interests and show the noncontrolling interests as an adjustment to arrive at FFO attributable to common stockholders. AFFO is calculated by adjusting our FFO by adding back items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, such as acquisition expenses, equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of deferred loan costs, the ineffective portion of fair value adjustments on our interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, prepayment penalties incurred on the early retirement of debt, and the noncontrolling interests related to these items. AFFO will also be adjusted to include any gains (losses) from sales of property to the extent excluded from FFO and exclude relevant noncontrolling interests. We also present AFFO excluding the impact of sales of real estate.
We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. 
The following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

 On August 4, 2015, The Department of Transportation of the State of Georgia ("DOT"), through exercise of eminent domain, appropriated 0.966 acres of land and certain access rights from The Crossings in Marietta, GA and paid the sum of approximately $326,000 as just and adequate compensation. The Company recognized a gain on eminent domain of approximately $158,000. Due to immateriality, the gain on eminent domain was included in Other Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Net Operating Income
NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as NOI is not affected by (1) the cost of funds, (2) acquisition costs, (3) non-operating fees to affiliates, (4) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, (5) corporate general and administrative expenses, (6) other gains and losses that are specific to us, and (7) expenses that are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the properties or incurred on behalf of the Company at the property level for expenses such as legal, professional and franchise tax fees. 
The following table, which has not been adjusted for the effects of noncontrolling interests, details our NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and our Same Store NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

Same Store Properties 
We review our stabilized multifamily communities on a comparable basis between periods. Our Same Store properties are defined as those that are stabilized and comparable for both the current period and the same period for the prior reporting year. There are 32 properties meeting this definition for the third quarter of 2016: Miramar, Arbors on Forest Ridge, Cutter's Point, Eagle Crest, Silverbrook, Timberglen, Toscana, The Grove at Alban, Edgewater at Sandy Springs, Beechwood Terrace, Willow Grove, Woodbridge, Abbington Heights, Courtney Cove, The Summit at Sabal Park, Timber Creek, Belmont at Duck Creek, Radbourne Lake, The Arbors, The Knolls, The Crossings at Holcomb Bridge, The Crossings, Regatta Bay, Sabal Palm at Lake Buena Vista, Southpoint Reserve at Stoney Creek, Twelve 6 Ten at the Park, Cornerstone, The Preserve at Terrell Mill, Dana Point, Heatherstone, Versailles, and Seasons 704.
Reconciliation of Guidance for 2016 NOI, FFO and AFFO
The Company anticipates that net income (loss) will be in the range between $(2.4) million to $(1.4) million for the full year and between $(2.1) million to $(1.1) million for the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of sales of real estate which is anticipated to be approximately $25.9 million for the full year 2016 and $0.0 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The difference between net income (loss) and FFO is depreciation and amortization, which is anticipated to be $35.1 million to $36.1 million for the full year 2016. The difference between FFO and AFFO is acquisition costs, which is anticipated to total approximately $0.9 million for the full year 2016, amortization of deferred financing costs, to the extent excluded from FFO, which is anticipated to total approximately $2.0 million for the full year 2016, and equity based compensation expense, which is anticipated to total approximately $0.8 million for the full year 2016. The difference between net income (loss) and NOI is advisory and administrative fees, corporate general and administrative expenses, certain property general and administrative expenses (see Note 1 below), depreciation and amortization, interest expense, acquisition costs which are anticipated to total approximately $70.4 million to $71.4 million for the full year and $18.5 million to $19.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.  2016 Full Year Guidance assumes we own all properties as of September 30, 2016 for the full year 2016. For purposes of the weighted average shares outstanding during the period, the Company assumes the shares outstanding as of November 9, 2016 remain outstanding through December 31, 2016.
In this release, "we," "us," "our," the "Company," "NexPoint Residential Trust," and "NXRT" each refer to NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.

Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating.

For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.

Brian Mitts
Thank you, Marilynn. I want to welcome everybody into the NXRT first quarter 2017 conference call. I am joined here with Matt McGraner, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and as Marilynn mentioned, I'm Brian Mitts, Chief Financial Officer. I'm going to begin with some highlights from the quarter and then discuss at a high level some of our Q1 results. Then I am going to turn to over Matt and let him talk about the portfolios and some in detail and some other items. We'll come back and discuss guidance for the remainder of 2017 and then turn it back to the operator for questions.
So let me get started on the highlights. We feel first quarter was a pretty solid start to the year. Just stepping back and looking at the stock price, our prices up 11% through yesterday's close, 12% if you include the dividends, which you think is a good performance versus peers in the index.

We reported GAAP net loss of $3.3 million, which was driven by an increase in depreciation $2.8 million over Q1 of ’16, which is primarily related to the acquisition of the Houston portfolio. At the end of 2016 in the Hollister Place our property in February, as well as an increase interest expense of $1.9 million, which is also related to the debt that we use to acquire both the Houston portfolio and Hollister Place.
As we mentioned in previous discussions, disclosures and presentations, we utilized debt to acquire those portfolios with a plan to pay those down via reverse 10:31 exchange which has begun to take place in April and then we'll get into that later on. Year-over-year same store revenue grew 7.3%, same store occupancy was up 60 basis points to 95% and same store NOI grew by 8.4%. 
We believe we continue to improve our value add thesis through dispositions and Matt is go into some detail on not that here in a minute. And those netted high IRRs, we continued strong pace of renovations with high return on equity, return – sorry, renovating 430 units in the first quarter that will return on equity at 21.1% on the leased units.
To date through March 31, we completed rehab on 4460 units at an average cost 4893 per unit with an average rent increase of $86 per month, which results in a return on equity of 20.7%.
We made one acquisition this year which is the aforementioned Hollister Place and through the end of April we've sold four properties as part of the reverse 10:31 tax deferred exchange to help fund the Houston portfolio acquisition we made end of ‘16.
We entered into a $100 million of interest rates swaps during the quarter, bringing our total of swaps to $500 million. Subsequent to quarter and in April we entered into an additional $50 million interest rate swap. Together with the prior swaps we have now fixed at this point - I'm sorry as of March 31, 35% were fully rate at an average rate across all of our debt at 3.61% we factor in all the various swaps.
That's a higher number as far as the amount of debt that's now fixed versus floating once you take into effect the pay downs that we’re making for the dispositions and the anticipated disposition.
In general, we're using the dispositions to deliver from the Houston portfolio acquisitions we mentioned paying down $40 million in some of the short term debt that we brought on and we did that in April. Regatta Bay properties under contract one sold will complete the 10:31 reverse exchange for the Hollister Place property and net proceeds will be used to further deliver.
For Q1 2017 financial results, we are reporting revenue of $37 million for the quarter, which is up 10.4% of our Q1 2016. We’re reporting net loss attributable to common shareholders of $3.3 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the quarter, which included $12.4 million of depreciation and interest expense of $7.2 million.
We are reporting NOI or net operating income of $19.7 million for the first quarter of ’17, as compared to $17.7 million for the first quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of a 11.4%.
We’re reporting FFO of $8 million, or $0.38 cents per diluted share, as compared to $8.6 million or $0.41 cents per diluted share for Q1 in 2016. We are reporting core FFO of $8.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share, as compared to $8.6 million or 41% - I am sorry $0.41 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2016.
And we’re reporting AFFO of $9.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share, which compares to $8.9 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016. Our same store properties continue to produce clear results, in our opinion we classified 35 properties as same store properties for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter, we increased rental income to 5.6%, other income 19% and same store NOI 8.4%. Quarter ending occupancy was up 60 basis points to 95%, as compared to the first quarter of 2016. And Matt’s is going to go into some more detail around those numbers in his update.

As of March 31, we had total cash of $53.7 million, of that $27.7 million is free cash on hand used in day to day operations to expand the dividend, ongoing expenses and other corporate purposes, $26 million of that represents of the $53.7 million represents restricted cash which includes $11.5 million of cash earmarked for capital expenditures for our value add program.
As of March 31, our total debt outstanding was $797.6 [ph] million and as we discussed that's come down since the end of the quarter through the dispositions we made in April, we continue to take that down further once we close Regatta Bay.
As of March 31, our preliminary debt is now 25% percent and our fixed rate debt is 35%, when you include the effect of the swaps. Adjusted weighted average interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness which we define as inclusive of the effect of the swaps is 3.61%when you factor in the pay down in debt, as well as the additional swaps that we entered into at the end of the quarter.
With the pay down before dispositions and the additional swaps that we entered into in Q2, the plus Regatta Bay sale and the de-levering that we will do with that transaction, the effect was fixed 90% of our debt in June.
The second quarter 2016 – ’17, the board has declared a dividend of $0.22 per share, which is the same as it was last quarter for shareholders record on June 15th 2017 payable on June 30th. As far as coverage for FFO our coverage is 1.7 one times per diluted share. Core FFO was 1.74 times per diluted share and 1.95 times our AFFO per diluted share.
So with that, let me turn it over to Matt to go through his comments.
Brian Mitts
Thanks, Brian. Let’s dig deeper into the value add results, the same store recap and leasing activity and in some capital recycling. From value add perspective as of today reflecting the four assets sold in the first quarter, all the remaining 35 active assets have some type of rehab in progress, approximately 73% of all budget exterior and common area dollars has been spent and approximately 57% of all budgeted interior dollars have been spent.
As we reported earlier, we completed 427 upgrades, two units for the quarter, portfolio wise and since in its inception, excluding the sold properties we have now upgraded 4460 interiors or about 33.7% of the growth portfolio for an average cost per unit of $4800 achieving approximately 21% Our ROI ended $86 per month increase.
The same sort recap as Brian mentioned, we reported 8.4% same store NOI growth over the prior year. The same store fours reached 87.5% of our properties or 11,409 units. Our rental revenue increased Brian mentioned by 5.6%, digging deeper into that number we achieved the following results as compared to the prior quarter.
Market rent was up 6% on the top line. We did better un-loss [ph] the lease recording at 22.1% reduction, also did better in vacancy [ph] the loss recording at 10.2% improvement there.
Average rent increased to $857 in the same store pool from 813% percent or $813 or 5.3% percent increase. Other income as Brian mentioned was 19% better year over year, led by strong upfront fee which was $83000 increase year every year at 20.2% increase and then valley trash [ph] program continues to help drive other income as well, that was 166,000 increase for the first quarter.
The same store by market, Dallas was up 8.3%, Houston up 3.3%, DC metro area was up 5.5%, Atlanta was strongest at12.6%, Nashville was 3.6%, primarily due to real estate tax adjustments. Charlotte was 5.4%, Phoenix was 9.3%, West Palm Beach was 7.1%, Orlando was 7.8%, Tampa at 9.2%.
Same store effective rent by market was also as strong and continues to be robust with five markets producing 5.3% or better effect rents year over year. On the leasing activity front, we saw strong effective rent growth across the portfolio year-on-year same, same year at new tenant for the first quarter although being slower part of the year we saw 2.6% growth in new leases, some of the markets with the highest were West Palm Beach at 7.23%, Atlanta at 4.82% and Dallas and Orlando each pushing over 3.5%.

Renewal growth also continue to be robust with 4.8 9% overall on 1379 renewals during the quarter. So $42 average monthly increase. Nashville was the highest at 6.82% during the quarter. Atlanta was second with 6.68% growth on renewals. Charlotte came in third at 5.86% and Tampa and Dallas rounded out up the top five with new increases each about 4.63%.
On the capital recycling front, as we previously discussed subsequent to the quarter we saw 3% [ph] in Dallas, Myanmar, Susquehanna 12:16 at the Park for $56.4 million, as well as one of our assets or our last asset rather in Frederick Maryland, [indiscernible] for $27.5 million. We generated gross proceeds from the sale of approximately a $83.9 million and yielded approximately levered IRR 40% and a 2.4 times multiple on invested capital.
Regatta Bay remains classified as held for sale, though it’s currently under contract leasehold for $28.2 million. We expect that to close in early June. Upon the closing of Regatta, we will have - we will have replaced the senior Bridge lines taken out to acquire the H2 portfolio in Hollister place with permanent first mortgages. In addition, we will completely retired to $30 term disability and pay down our revolver from $29 million to approximately $5 million.
Even though with the competition for five C assets with value upside remains robust, we continue to be active in the investment in marketplace and are increasingly focused on second chance opportunities with deals that have fallen or out of contract.
Given our cost to capital and positive liquidity profile, we’ll continue to be opportunistic with a view for towards doing more of the same. That’s harvesting gains, redeploying the capital and high quality, cover land plays with value add potential.
Let’s spend a minute on our refinancing strategy that we've been implementing as of late and pursuing to improve the longer term earnings profile of the company. Given the uptick in LIOBOR treasury market since the election, we noticed some letters of reduced spreads from the levels we saw last summer. For example floating rates spreads depending on leverage profile particularly in our leverage category that’s come in anywhere from 20 to 40 basis points. And given this tightening and as Brian mentioned we decided to enter into $150 million of additional swaps on previously unprotected or unhedged debt bringing our portfolio average indeed tax rate to approximately 1.25%.
In the coming months you'll see us plan to take advantage of these title and lease spreads by refinancing this $150 million of previously unprotected debt, while still in return and maintaining the all important prepayment flexibility.
And looking ahead, we're excited about how we’re position to take advantage of the peak demand during spring leasing season, especially in our mid-market demographic. As of the end of April for example, our portfolio sits at 94.2% physically occupied in 94.88% leased.
Renewal can continue to be robust in April and it's currently posting a 6.2% increase. New lease growth over current effective rents was 4.1% in April loan, showing great signs of keeping pace with last year’s solid demand.
That’s all I have for prepared remark, I’d l like to thank our teams NexPoint for their continued hard work and execution. I’d like turn it back over to Brian.
Brian Mitts

We are reaffirming our 2017 full year guidance as follows, revenue low in $142 million, high end $144 million for midpoint of $143 million. Net income $26.25 million on the low end $28.25 million on the high end for a midpoint of $27.25 million.
NOI $75 million on the low end, 77 million on the high end for midpoint of $76 million. FFO per diluted share $1.55 per share in the low end, $1.64 per share on high end for midpoint of $1. 60 cents per diluted share.

Core FFO on the low end $1.58 per diluted share, $1.67 per diluted share on the high end for midpoint of $1.62 per diluted share. And finally AFFO $1.80 per diluted share on low, $1.80o per diluted share on the high end for midpoint of $1.85 per diluted share.
Same basic assumptions last quarter overnight projecting any additional acquisitions or dispositions beyond what we’ve already discussed. Obviously as Matt discussed, we are engaging upon a refinancing strategy. These numbers don’t necessarily reflect all that. It does reflect in these swaps that we put in place and the pay downs of the debt from the 4 dispositions, as well as the anticipated pay downs from the Regatta Bay disposition.
With that let me just give a couple of closing thoughts and kind of recap. We continue to focus on our recycling of capital on a tax efficient manner and growing NOI, FFO and core FFO and AFFO per share. We think that we’ve done a pretty good job of that here and as Matt mentioned continue to be active looking for opportunities that fit into what we're trying to do.
We will continue to position the balance sheet in the capital stack for the future. Walking in more certainty by fixing more a larger percentage of our debt and try to take advantage of some of the things we see in the marketplace there's Matt not talked about. We’re going to continue to use reverse 10:31 exchanges and available lines that we have from [indiscernible] to do acquisitions in the future to the extent necessary and from time to time you may see like this quarter where interest expense spikes up, but we intend to bring that down and have a plan in place prior to making those acquisitions.
And just also you continue to own a lot of this company and continue to add to that position which you think obviously aligns us with shareholders. We continue - we anticipate to continue to increase our holdings of this company in the future.
So with that let me turn it over to operator for any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Daniel Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.
Daniel Donlan
Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to dig little bit into the guidance, is the additional $150 million of interest rate swaps, was that originally part of your thought process when you put out guidance. Was that kind of - is that that kind of potential you know, head or potential plus you know kind of versus what you originally expected?
Brian Mitts
Yeah, it was in the original guidance we put out in March. So that's new for this quarter. But we felt there was other changes that overall guidance was right in line with where it was before. Also as mentioned and Matt talked about in little bit of detail, it’s kind of done in conjunction with refinancing strategy to take advantage of tighter spreads. So it's kind of a net wash ultimately.
Daniel Donlan
Okay. So it sounds like fundamentals are maybe better than you expected when you put it out and that's probably making it a net wash, is that fair to say?
Brian Mitts
Yes, I think that part, but then also the decrease that we expect to get from refinances from the debt these swamps recovery.
Daniel Donlan
Okay. And then the jump in same store maintenance costs. You know I think of competitive years for put some of their repair and maintenance expense in the winter months, we just kind of curious if that something similar was going on with you guys or is this something that we should expect to remain elevated in future quarters?
Matt McGraner
There is two components of it. One is the higher turn costs. We had a higher turnover ratio in the first quarter than it’s been in the past. So that was a decent component of it. The other part was it - was sort of an implementation or continued expansion of some of the other income items that have to hit the arm in bucket based on our policy. For example Valley trash [ph] and rolling out Valley trash there's an immediate expense taken to the rollout of the program. But it’s then recaptured through the other income bucket.

The net effect of it is that for every dollar that we spend on Valley trash and other income buckets we get about $1. 63 back, but it have an increase in the line item.
Daniel Donlan
Okay. Okay. And then I think you talked about in the past that you might have to get some tax reductions at the Houston properties. And given what you paid versus what the prior owners pay, we’re just kind of curious you know when you think that those benefits would hit you know and how you're progressing toward that goal?
Matt McGraner
Yes, so we're actively working on it. It's a good question and I would say it's a portfolio wide question that we're currently working on. We think that the numbers the real estate tax numbers in our guidance and our budgets are conservative. So we're hoping to beat those, not withstanding the municipalities robust interest in finance. That being said for the Houston assets, specifically the H2 and Hollister Place, we think that will some clarity on those by the beginning of the third quarter.
Daniel Donlan
Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. And then I'm sorry I got a little bit late this – a lot of this morning, but just kind of curious if you could characterize the current acquisition environment. You know it certainly seems to be pretty competitive. But you know you do have a lot of capital avail to you, you know whether it's you know to your debt, I am just kind of curious you know your general appetite for acquisitions going forward and kind of where you know where you see - if you see opportunities out there and you know is a more one off or is there any potential you know smaller portfolios you think that you can you can pick up especially given that there's been some big trades and you know oftentimes when that happens you know there's a couple of properties that may shake out that may not be viewed as core to somebody else but it could be for the years?
Matt McGraner
Yes, it’s a good question. We first start by saying we think that there's a robust market for demand in the middle income rider [ph] profile which is where we play obviously and we don't see that waiting off any time soon. So we still like the market a lot and we're still pursuing acquisitions or being under the 10 if you will in a number of opportunities, but we're also being patient.
 I’d say that for smaller deals, sub $30 million, the competition is still very robust. You know have 10 12 offers, everyone in close. Sometimes you have a 10%,31% that just you know those are stupid number and it beats everyone. So we've seen now a lot of. We’ve also around sell side and we're continuing to take advantage of it.
But we focus mainly is the $20 million to $50 million our equity check range where you know a few folks could play especially for these types of value add assets. We're outside of the core fund. And then we're outside of the core corpus fund guys. And then we're you know we're outside of the private regional guys as well. So we're focusing on that in 2015 with our pre check range and don't have anything yet, but we're certainly - we're certainly trying to dig up opportunities and exist.
Daniel Donlan
Okay. Okay. And then just curious going back to your comments about you know the maintenance costs being elevated this quarter because of the higher turn. Is there any trend there that you can maybe point to, maybe it was just like one or two assets, but you know is it you know what do you thinks been driving, you know what drove that higher turn in the first quarter relative to kind of maybe past quarters?
Matt McGraner
I think in past quarters or with respect to that it's time over Q1 of 2016, we have created more units and we're pushing – and not pushing people out, but we're certainly trying to push rents at higher cliff and that end you know, March was pretty much I'd say the big impact of that and that's typical with spring leasing season , yes, March, April, May June is when you can see when you're going to see higher term and you should also see higher rents which you know as I said in my prepared remarks April was incredibly strong for us and we don't and we don't think that's going to stop the functioning.

Daniel Donlan
Okay. I appreciate the color.
Matt McGraner
Thanks, Dan.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.
Ryan Meliker
Hey good morning guys. Thanks for a lot of good color earlier and to Dan's questions. I just want to talk a little bit more about Houston you talked about the property tax dynamic that could unfold to Houston will address your properties. I'm just wondering when you think about Houston specifically what are you seeing across that market. Do you think that fundamentals are going to start to turn positive soon in a meaningful way? Do you think it is just that the second derivative and the pace of deceleration is sighted. And are you seeing that start to impact the valuation?
Matt McGraner
Very, very good questions. I wouldn't say the tale of two cities and that tells you asset are class sizes or class type. So [indiscernible] eastern and the western portion - the western portion is still a challenge regardless of if it you know class A or B. But these are stronger and then the eastern portion continues to be strong, an example is our sailing in Regatta Bay that’s going to sell for you know assuming its starts sale out 5.5% cap rate on an T3 over T12 adjusted. So that's on a nominal basis.
And then within sort of the you know the 10, I think I may have mentioned this on the first quarter call or the fourth quarter call, a lot of people are focusing again on using the think that there's a bargain which is increasing the size of the transaction activity and the number of people focusing on trying to get a discount. So there are no shortage of buyers in that market today at least as it pertains to class-B assets.
I think that you know you've heard both in America say this they are focusing on the you know the lease up opportunities in class-A which seems like a strong smart strategy because there are many opportunities I this year but it's just not our [indiscernible] so to speak.
As far as demand you know in part of our H2 acquisition we think the 17 deliveries are still going to be probably that net neutral because we're still going to be some, the ’18 the supply really falls off a cliff. And again if you get any sort of stable stabilization and job growth there which we're seeing and when we'll publish down on this review presentation. I think the market's going to you know turn positive in the early to mid half of 2018.
Ryan Meliker
Great. That's helpful. And then just one other real quick one we had you know you did you gave some good color surrounding interest expense and what you guys are doing from a refinancing perspective. Obviously you sold some assets pay down some debt more recently.
As we think about you know how of the next three quarters are going to trend from an interest expense perspective. You know can you give us some guidance in terms of what we should expect you know is it going to moderate and we're going to be at a run rate basis comparable you know for three consecutive quarters in a row or is it going to gradually wind down based on how swaps come into play and when you when you as you execute your refinancing strategy et cetera?
Matt McGraner
Yeah, I think going forward looking to this second quarter you will see a decrease based on the debt we paid down already and will continue to pay down. And I think given the assumptions that we're making which is no additional acquisitions or dispositions, you'd see kind of moderate and get on the run rate.
The difference would be if we did some acquisition and didn't raise the equity and did what we did with the Houston Hall's portfolio where perhaps we use leverage to fund them and then use the sale after the fact to pay down that additional debt.
So you may see it jump for a quarter, but they will come back down and that maybe something that happens over time that it’s a decrease in then decrease back down to a more normalized run rate.

Ryan Meliker
Got you. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks guys.
Matt McGraner
Thanks, Ryan.
Operator
We’ll take our next question from [indiscernible] with Jefferies.
Q – Unidentified Analyst
Good morning guys. I just a quick question on the M&A call you did hear some commentary about new supply and many of the market and I think that's one of the key reasons that took down same store revenue guidance. Granted you guys do not focus on the exact same type of properties. But could you just talk a little bit about kind of what you were seeing in your markets and specifically what you're seeing in regards to the product type that you're targeting to supply headwind?
Matt McGraner
Yes, absolutely. So our two largest markets Dallas and Atlanta are certainly seeing supply, Dallas especially most of that is in the you know in the case of Dallas the uptown area you have some [indiscernible] but the majority of it is sort of in the CBD uptown area.
Same thing as it relates to Atlanta and the perimeter in Buckhead and it's on the top end to the class there class A or class A - luxury and for the most part as that relates to our products. You know we said in the past that you know a new developer in our markets needs you know $15, 1700 range for a one bedroom to get you know 4% stabilize yield. We need $800, 850 to make it 6.
So there's still that to get into a retail rent between class A B markets and the market and the market just doesn't allow for new construction of affordable housing which is the segment that we focus on. And you know late last year you know a tax credit developer in which case you're in a different demographic and area of the city in general.
So we think that seeing new construction in our markets is good because it just helps you know show that rent demand is there. All that being said, it is still very, very difficult or increasingly difficult to get a construction on. Whereas you know a year or two ago you could get a construction loan with 25%, 30% equity today 40%, 50%. So we're seeing you know we're seeing entirely new standards in an age waiver of wage and labor costs continue to rise. And then there's less land available so all that seems to be pointing to signs of moderating supply. Our markets still have strong permitting data. But you know eventually I think that those factors will lead to lots of fire.
Brian Mitts
And it's worth mentioning as far as our strategy as Matt mentioned in prior question. We're trying to play in that $20 million to $50 million equity check range where there's less competition. So if you take the supply question out of it and focus on the bidding for our assets there's not a lot of people I think who we are because of the public agree or lower cost of capital well-positioned to compete in that area, particularly in these markets.
Q – Unidentified Analyst
Got you. And another one for me. Could you just talk a little bit about the your [[indiscernible] on your Phoenix market where you have negative year-on-year growth rental rates is kind of what's happening with market dynamics?
Brian Mitts
So DC is market that I would say it was our weakest at the Frederick Maryland, some market was our weakest asset market and obviously with the sale of our second asset there drove it all in which we made money on a pretty decent return, we're out of. So those were assets that say it doesn't feel anything about the you know the DC metro area in general.
With respect to Phoenix. So Phoenix is again an asset specific topic. One of our - two of our largest properties there Colonnade in the Point at Foothills, our larger properties that we are focusing more have focused more on our debt in the first quarter and into the fourth quarter making sure we had heads in the beds such that we can start implementing our business plan and turning units and upgrading needed on turns as they roll and then the total revenue in Phoenix. If you look at it just from the above net effective rents and the other income was actually up 6.7% percent in the quarter. So while we were moderating to 54 in the door in occupancy up to stabilize those two properties that are higher in 93%, 94% percent cliff we did see a pretty significant outperformance in total revenue there.

Q – Unidentified Analyst
Got you. Thank you very much.
Brian Mitts
Thank you.
That concludes today's question-and-answer session. This time I'll turn the call back to Mr. Brian Mitts for any final remarks.
Brian Mitts
Thank you. We appreciate everyone's time. Very good questions. Hopefully we got some good color out there and hope people kind of think about what’s headed here in 2017. We look forward to. I am mad seeing everyone is NAREIT New York and then we'll be back in August on Q2 call. So thank you very much.
