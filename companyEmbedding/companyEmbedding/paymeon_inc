Announces Addition of “PayMeOn BRANDS” Subsidiary to Focus on Development of Market Lifestyle Brands and ProductsAccesswireMarch 1, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareFORT LAUDERDALE, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 1, 2016 / PayMeOn Inc. (OTC MARKETS: PAYM) ("PayMeOn" or "The Company"), a diversified developer, marketer, and manager of lifestyle brands and products, has today announced the creation of a new, wholly-owned subsidiary called PayMeOn Brands ("PAYM Brands"). PayMeOn has formed this new subsidiary to pursue the business of developing, marketing, managing and monetizing lifestyle brands and products. The Company intends to leverage its relationships and expertise with respect to manufacturing processes, wholesale and retail distribution networks, and social influencer promotion, primarily targeting youth oriented "lifestyle" markets to create and grow new and existing brands across several market segments.According to Edward A. Cespedes, CEO of PayMeOn, "At the outset, the Company will focus primarily on integrated and diversified lifestyle apparel lines and alternative personal transportation products, but our platform will allow for rapid expansion as we are approached by various additional purveyors of lifestyle brands." Mr. Cespedes continued, "The Company is confident in the outstanding cumulative experience of its seasoned management team and is pleased to confirm that during this past Quarter (4th Calendar Quarter of 2015), the Company committed to building several novel and potentially lucrative partnerships, which are currently being enhanced."Generally, the main business model that The Company intends to establish is best defined as the acquisition of "Exclusive Rights" to a variety of brands that it believes are able to be leveraged and expanded into additional "complimentary" product lines. In addition, the Company intends to develop and or acquire proprietary products, which are essentially brands that are still under contemplation but do not yet exist; such brands would target substantial growth markets and exist as "lifestyle" oriented brands.In conjunction with the upcoming launch of both its products and brands, PayMeOn is proud to announce it has partnered with Willie Escobar Montanez and Jose Rodriguez to manage the potential growth, focus group activities, and development of future PayMeOn Brands. Messrs. Montanez and Rodriguez have nearly 40 years combined of experience creating, developing and marketing brands, especially in youth oriented markets.Willie Escobar Montanez is well known for his own brand "Willie Esco," a highly successful urban streetwear brand and has worked with globally known brands, including Samsung, United-Arrows, Barneys, COOGI, Daymond John, KITH, Etonic, Tupac Shakur, Rag & Bone, and Android Homme. Mr. Montanez has secured licenses for brand development ranging from Tupac Shakur to MGM film/movie licenses that have been instrumental in generating more than $200 million in worldwide sales to date.Jose Rodriguez has more than 15 years experience developing brands such as Platinum FUBU, Rocawear, Sean John and others. Mr. Rodriguez's design portfolio has generated more than $100 million in sales. Focusing especially on brand image, Mr. Rodriguez maintains personal and professional relationships with high profile luminaries and organizations, such as 50 Cent and G-Unit Records, Shady Records, StarPower Global (Fabolous), Roc Nation, Def Jam, and many others.ABOUT PayMeOn Inc.PayMeOn Inc. (PAYM) develops, markets, manages and monetizes lifestyle brands and products. The Company leverages its relationships and expertise with manufacturing, wholesale and retail distribution, and social influencer promotion, primarily in youth oriented "lifestyle" markets to create and grow new and existing brands across products.

Paymeon Announces Expansion of Its "I RIDE ELECTRIC" Business to Premier Retail Location
Company set to expand its portfolio of products and to create branding and apparel around these new products.  Fort Lauderdale, FL,  October 23, 2015 --(PR.com)-- Paymeon, Inc. (ticker symbol: PAYM) announced today that it has entered into a lease for approximately 4,100 square feet of premier retail storefront space in Fort Lauderdale. According to Ed Cespedes, CEO of Paymeon, “The highly visible location on North Federal Highway is the ideal location to begin the expansion of our 'I Ride Electric' business. Prior to the acquisition of this space, we have primarily marketed our business online.” Mr. Cespedes continued, “We expect the substantial customer traffic around our new location will help accelerate sales of our existing electric bicycle products. In addition, we have begun aggressively expanding product lines and have recently added self balancing scooters, also known as 'hoverboards', to our offerings. We expect hoverboards to be in substantial demand during the upcoming holiday season.”Paymeon’s largest shareholder, Vincent L Celentano, added that “the company is broadening its growth plan to include products around extreme sports, including apparel and other extreme sports items. He continued, “Having a flagship store as a showcase to display it all is the perfect foundation for us.”The company expects to announce details of its expansion and branding plans in the near future.DisclaimersThis press release includes management assumptions about our business prospects, financial forecasts, projections and other forward looking statements regarding PayMeOn, Inc. its business, prospects and potential transactions it is considering.
