Alastin Skincare: Does Alastin Skincare Work?


 Health Page Rank Score: 



By: Wendy Adler  Category: Wrinkle Cream Review 






Alastin Skincare Overview
Alastin is a company that produces a wide variety of skin products that all help reduce signs of aging and damage. They have a very informative website that features sections about the history of the company, the founders and formula advisory team. All contact details are provided and there are links to how Alastin’s products  have been mentioned in the media. Other sections on the site, which is very user-friendly and well-designed, include full descriptions and explanations of how the products work, along with diagrams that demonstrate the effects. The site also discusses the type of skin problems users may experience and makes appropriate product recommendations and it also lists different cosmetic procedures and suggests Alastin products that can be used as alternatives. 
The cost of Alastin Skincare products vary but they range from around $40 to $90. There are no free samples or trials offered but the products are backed by a 30 day refund offer.
Ingredients Contained in The Product
Vary depending on the product
Alastin Skincare Product Description

The Alastin Skincare range includes a variety of products that are designed to be part of a full skincare range. Alastin produces cleansers, moisturizers, eye creams and more specialized products that are designed to be used after cosmetic procedures have been performed on the skin (their ‘Invasive’ line). Most of the products use the Alastin TriHex Technology which is a blend of peptides that may help support collagen and elastin levels, inflammation response and maintain the rejuvenation of the skin overtime. Each product has a separate page of information that includes an overview of what it is used for, the main benefits and the key active ingredients. For example the Ultra Nourishing Moisturizer with TriHex Technology supports the nourishment and hydration of the face, neck and chest area using a blend of natural ingredients in a fragrance free formula. This particular product should be used in the morning and evening and the website suggests other products in the range that work in conjunction with the formula. All of the Alastin Skincare products are said to support the skin’s structural and biochemical matrix, strengthening and stimulating the skin on a long term basis.
Good about Alastin Skincare 

Alastin Skincare is an established and reputable company
All product key ingredients are listed
Company history and contact details are provided
Some of the products are well priced
The products use TriHex Technology
There is a 30 day refund offered
Scientific data is shown

Bad about Alastin Skincare

No full ingredient lists are shown
Some products in the range are costly
No before and after photos are shown

Alastin Skincare The Bottom Line
While Alastin Skincare may not be as well known as some brands of skincare on the market, they do appear to produce some good quality products that have been extensively tested for their effects on aging skin. Using some of the products in the Invasive range may help the skin recover after a surgical procedure while the others in the range may, overtime, keep the skin healthy and strong by providing essential peptides and other botanical ingredients. It would be helpful if the company offered free samples but they do have a reasonably good refund term for consumers.

About Your Skin


ALASTIN Skincare™ Overview 
The ALASTIN Skincare™ product line helps prepare and increase skin receptivity to procedures as well as enhancing the healing process in order to optimize the overall procedure result. The products are also designed to combat the signs of aging, and improve and maintain skin health with daily use. ALASTIN Skincare™ products, with proprietary TriHex Technology™, feature a patent-pending synergistic blend of potent peptides and key ingredients in a formulation designed to penetrate the skin. ALASTIN Skincare™ products featuring TriHex Technology™ are based on proprietary science designed to stimulate, strengthen and support the skin’s regenerative processes to enhance skincare procedure outcomes. When stimulated by ALASTIN Skincare™ products, the new skin is softer, smoother and more pliable.
In histological studies, ALASTIN Skincare™ products have been shown to enhance the deposition of both elastin and collagen. This demonstration of enhanced elastin deposition in histological studies has established ALASTIN Skincare™ as the leader among skincare lines in the area of elastin stimulation.
Importance of Elastin and Collagen
Elastin and collagen are the primary structural component proteins in the dermis. Collagen and elastin are abundant in early skin and critical for its ability to renew and regenerate. Levels of collagen and elastin begin diminishing almost immediately from birth, and by middle age, elastin replenishment is minimal.1,2,3,4
Therefore, skin becomes less and less able to naturally recycle itself and regenerate, resulting in slower wound healing and the tell-tale signs of aging, including:

Pre-procedure and aged skin often presents with the following:5

Peptides and Skin Regeneration
Peptides are small proteins naturally present in the body that direct cell signaling. Certain peptides signal the generation of collagen and elastin. Also, some have modulating and recycling properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), enhancing the skin’s own ability to generate renewed, healthy skin. 
Effects of Time on the ECM
The ECM, the largest component of the dermal skin layer, is the central orchestrator of skin repair and regeneration. The ECM provides the background for cellular and matrix component signaling and cross-talk. Over time, certain factors create waste products in the ECM including:
• Extrinsic factors: sun (primary) and other environmental factors
• Intrinsic factors: genetics, aging, hormones
These waste products result in protein clumping. Protein clumps clutter the ECM, interfering with the crosstalk necessary for healthy cellular regeneration – i.e. the body’s ability to produce fresh, healthy skin.6,7,8,9,10

Skin Bed Preparation
In aged skin, collagen and elastin clumping leads to inefficient fibroblasts and compromised ECM. The strategy for reversing this long term-damage is to recycle the ECM and begin to remove the clumped protein fragments, thereby allowing natural cell signalling to occur effectively in order to stimulate regeneration of collagen and elastin.
Similar to how the chronic wound healing process requires wound bed preparation before therapeutic intervention, treatment of chronic aging of the skin benefits from a “skin bed preparation” to optimize the outcome of rejuvenation procedures and skin maintenance programs. This skin bed preparation serves to optimize procedure outcomes by creating an environment ideal for healing and regeneration.
Ideally this skin bed preparation or pre-conditioning takes place over a 2-3 week period prior to the procedure. TriHex Technology™ stimulates the clearing of the debris from the ECM, allowing the body to produce new collagen and elastin.
Skin Repair
Although many patients believe the healing process is complete within a few short weeks post-procedure, that visible healing is only on the skin’s surface. In truth, the full healing process can last well beyond the visual signs of recovery. Invasive and non-invasive procedures require specific aftercare and the healing process can last as long as 1-3 months post-treatment.
When skin is cut or injured in a surgical, ablative, laser or peel procedure, the body begins a natural process of healing, including:
• The Inflammation Phase: stabilizes the site and cleans away dead cells and any bacteria; lasts a short period of time and if prolonged, can lead to scar formation
• The Reparative Phase: skin cells multiply and initiate mobilization to close the wound and regenerate the epidermis (outer skin layer)
• The Remodeling Phase: completes the skin remodeling; can take 30-90 days or more and is marked by the formation of new layers of skin built up from within; moderation of inflammation can reduce scarring and discoloration.
Similar to how the chronic wound healing process benefits from wound bed preparation, treatment of aging of the skin may be improved with a “skin bed preparation” to optimize rejuvenation procedures and skin maintenance programs.

TriHex Technology™

ALASTIN Skincare™ Technology and Benefits 
ALASTIN Skincare™ scientists have developed a patent-pending TriHex Technology™ which is incorporated into both the Procedure Enhancement Systems and the Restore and Renew line and is based upon a deep understanding of the skin’s extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is a collection of extracellular molecules that provide structural and biochemical support to the surrounding cells in the dermis. A healthy and well-functioning ECM is necessary for the skin’s natural regenerating processes to occur efficiently.  
TriHex Technology™ is a proprietary blend of peptides and other key ingredients that enhance the health of the skin by helping to clear the damaged, aged proteins in the skin's ECM.  The technology also helps to support the production of elastin and collagen, modulate inflammation, facilitate recovery and maintain the overall effect of a rejuvenating procedure over time. An efficient ECM optimizes receptivity to the Restore and Renew line, which is designed to strengthen the skin, address antiaging concerns, and protect the skin from further damage.
The synergistic ingredients in TriHex Technology™ are incorporated into proprietary (patent pending) formulations to achieve effective dermal penetration while also eliminating the stinging and burning caused many other products.
ALASTIN Skincare™ products can enhance procedural results by preparing the skin prior to a procedure and by helping the skin’s natural healing process during the recovery phases for as long as 90 days post-procedure.

Expert's Opinion

The Alastin line fills a much-needed void in the pretreatment and post laser recovery process. Its an elegant way of shortening downtime and minimizing complications from other greasy alternatives we have used in the past.

ALASTIN Skincare, Inc. Key Developments

Alastin Skincare Announces HydraTint ProMineral Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 36
Feb 13 17
Alastin Skincare, Inc. announced ALASTIN HydraTint ProMineral Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 36. ALASTIN HydraTint ProMineral Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 36 is a new generation of sun protection that men and women will actually want to wear every day. The lightweight formula is oil-free, absorbs quickly and has a complexion-enhancing tint, meaning it will not leave behind a ghoulish white residue or unwanted shine. A subtle, universally flattering natural hint of color evens out all skin tones and can be worn alone or as a primer underneath makeup. The elegant matte formula protects against UVA/UVB rays and includes age-defying antioxidants and skin hydrating ingredients. An all-physical block eliminates the irritation potential of chemical sun blocks and provides long-wearing water resistance while green tea extract and vitamin E supply antioxidant protection. The antioxidant-rich formula reduces skin damage due to collagen degradation caused by UV light, and protects from damaging effects of UVA radiation. Plus, a unique air pollution shield further defends skin against environmental aggressors and free radicals, going beyond simple sun protection.

Carlsbad, Calif. (PRWEB)
July 01, 2015
 Alastin Skincare, Inc—a specialty skincare company dedicated to developing and marketing innovative, clinically-tested skincare products that enhance, protect, and maintain healthy skin for a lifetime—launches its initial Procedure Enhancement product line today. This line incorporates innovative technology, formulated to enhance the efficacy of ablative and surgical procedures, reduce recovery times, and support long-term anti-aging skincare.
“Many products promote collagen generation, but perfect, “baby-like” skin recovery needs both collagen and elastin. Alastin’s TriHex Technology™ is a proprietary blend of peptides that signals to the body to activate the production of elastin and collagen, reinforcing the skin’s natural regenerating properties,” said Scott Glenn, CEO of Alastin Skincare. “We are very excited about introducing a new technology into the marketplace, and our products will be distributed exclusively through our physician partners.”
About Alastin Skincare, Inc.: 
Alastin Skincare™ is dedicated to developing innovative, clinically-tested skin care products that correct, protect, and maintain healthy skin for a lifetime. Our unparalleled procedure enhancement products are formulated using the latest technology and are clinically tested to ensure both safety and effectiveness to reawaken the skin’s youthful processes.

Home » About » Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery


Cosmetic Surgery Associates is committed to helping each and every patient attain a more appealing, new look!

Our physicians are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) and are fellows of the American College of Surgeons. They can provide you with advanced care and modern surgical techniques.
Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge are members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) and the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS). With over years of experience each, they continue to prove their aesthetic talent time and time again.
Contents1 Our Procedures1.1 Areas Of Specialization1.2 Facelift1.3 Liposuction1.4 Breast Augmentation2 Non-invasive Options2.1 Chemical Peels2.2 Injectables3 Our Qualifications4 Consultation4.1 Questions To Ask4.2 Essential Guidance
Our Procedures
Cosmetic Surgery Associates offer a variety of plastic surgery procedures designed to help you achieve a better appearance, which can help you feel more confident.
Some of these procedures can also fulfill true medical needs. For example, a nose job can help improve your appearance and your breathing. Also, eyelid surgery can improve your vision as well as your facial appearance.
You should understand however that the circumstances and experience of every individual would be unique. Each individual has his or her own features, goals and expectations.
Areas Of Specialization

Facial Rejuvenation: Depending upon your degree of facial aging, you may be interested in such procedures as facelift surgery, brow lift, midface lift, or /facial-rejuvenation/eyelid-surgery/. Alternatively, if nasal correction is of interest, you may wish to inquire about the results achieved by our past McLean rhinoplasty patients.
Breast Augmentation: Whether you would like to enlarge your breasts using implants, or lift them to counteract the effects of time and gravity, Drs. Richards, Dr. Jabs and Dr. Magge can help you attain your aesthetic goals. Additionally, both women and men may undergo breast reduction surgery at our practice.
Body Contouring: While natural weight loss is the most effective means of maintaining long-term results, body sculpting may motivate some to accomplish their diet and exercise goals. Such procedures include liposuction and tummy tuck surgery.
Our before and after plastic surgery photos feature some of the great results our plastic surgeons have achieved.

You must take the time to collect the right information about the procedure you’re considering, such as the risks, uncertainties, and side effects. We expect you to have questions. Our doctors have extensive training and keen eyes for aesthetic beauty. Our offices are centered around our patients’ comfort; the way you feel when you enter the surgery clinic of Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge is important to us. 

We treat every case with sensitivity and attentiveness.

Knowing every detail of your desired surgery is important – the techniques, surgery time, procedure steps, and aftercare are areas to look into. During the initial consultation, our doctors will address your concerns and help you decide which procedure is best for you, but the final decision rests in your hands. Remember that the recovery period is an important element of the plastic surgery experience, so follow your doctor’s instructions carefully.
In addition we specialize in the following procedures:
Facelift
As aging occurs, the facial appearance of many people is affected by loose skin and facial lines. Fortunately, our Maryland facelift specialists can help you rid your face of these imperfections.
Our doctors are also facelift specialists who have created a refreshing, new look for many patients.
Liposuction
If you wish to achieve a better-contoured figure, you can seek the help of a liposuction specialist. Also known as “lipoplasty,” this cosmetic procedure aims to eliminate excess fat in your midsection.
Our plastic surgeons are also liposuction specialists who have performed this surgical procedure for many people. To obtain a more toned look on stomach, you may also consider the help of one of our tummy tuck specialists.
Breast Augmentation
Many women have sought the aesthetic guidance of our breast augmentation specialists to improve the shape and size of their natural breasts. Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge possess the skills to surgically enhance the look of your breasts for the better.
Our breast augmentation specialists understand the importance of providing their patients with an image that they can fully enjoy!
Non-invasive Options

If you’re frustrated with wrinkle creams and night treatments that don’t work, you may want to meet with a cosmetic surgeon in Washington D.C. to discuss your options.

Aesthetic surgery is a personal decision; what is right for one person may not be right for you. You may prefer a temporary solution like Botox, Restylane, or Radiesse for facial rejuvenation rather than invasive procedures. Or you may consider a wide array of facial resurfacing options. 
Our Professional estheticians and makeup artists bring years of experience to the practice of Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge. We are aware that healthy skin can only be attained if you pay attention to it; yet not everybody does.
Chemical Peels

Chemical peels are available to improve uneven skin tone and acne problems. Through the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, it will also refresh your appearance.



Glycolic Peel
Sensitive Peel
Beta Peel


Power Peel Microdermabrasion
Retin-A Peel
Facial Waxing




A good doctor or esthetician is trained to help you find the best skincare treatments for your unique body. During a consultation visit, he or she can discuss your cosmetic options and answer any questions you may have. Another popular option to address facial wrinkles is injectables.

All of our board certified doctors are well respected in the community and trusted by peers and patients alike.
We believe that patient care is top priority, and will always be committed to the needs of men and women seeking cosmetic or reconstructive enhancement.
Credentials to Consider




Training
Board certification
Hospital Privileges


Experience
Professional Societies




Our doctors have appeared in the media numerous times, exemplifying their knowledge and experience time and again. Along with obtaining numerous credentials, these surgeons have built a name for themselves. Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge together believe that the initial consultation is a crucial time in learning exactly what they can do to help their clients meet realistic goals.
Their credentials in their field speak for themselves. All are standing members in:
The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)
The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS)
Their philosophy on great patient care should be a model for plastic surgeons everywhere – they want the time you spend in their offices to be not only mentally rewarding, but successful in reaching your plastic surgery goals. All Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge have extensive training in cosmetic surgery. They use their skills to not only help people change their attitudes, but also in the reconstruction and repair of a person’s body.
Through education and years of experience, these highly respected surgeons are able to provide their patients with the answers needed to help make such an important decision. Plastic surgery may sound scary to some people, but with doctors you can trust, the idea of changing your look becomes more of a comfortable thought.
Consultation
Our medical professionals understand that you will have concerns. This is why we are committed to helping you understand all that plastic surgery entails. It is a big deal, and you should definitely gather as much information as possible before going forward in your decision.
Plastic surgery is not for everyone; ultimately, the choice comes down to the individual. You may also want to speak with a loved one or friend who has had the same procedure you are considering. There are risks and uncertainties in all areas of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, so educating yourself is the best way to gain an understanding of what’s to come.
Questions To Ask


How long have you performed this procedure?
How many patients have you performed the procedure on?
What are the possible side effects, uncertainties, and risks?
If a serious complication should occur, can it be corrected?
May I speak with a patient who underwent this procedure with you?


The one-on-one meeting is a perfect time to have your concerns addressed. A personal consultation visit gives you the opportunity to gain a sense of the doctor’s personality. This is important because the cosmetic surgeon you choose should be someone you feel comfortable with.
Trusted by peers and patients alike, Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge understand that good communication leads to a positive doctor-patient relationship.
Essential Guidance


Deciding on the best procedure(s) for your body
Understanding your goals and expectations
Choosing a vitamin supplement that may aid in your recovery
Learning about the importance of aftercare


We want you to leave our surgery clinic with pride in the quality care you receive. The recovery period is just as important to us as it is to you, so we are happy to provide you with names of aftercare facilities in your area and pertinent information regarding the aftermath of plastic surgery.
Plastic surgery specialists Dr. Jabs, Dr. Richards and Dr. Magge are available for initial consultation visits. During this time, you can ask any questions you want, look at before-and-after photographs, and view complimentary computer images. No two results are the same, but with these tools, you can at least get a good idea of what’s in store!
We would love to hear from you. Please contact us at either of our offices:
Maryland (301) 493-4334
Virginia (703) 506-0683

Dr. A. Dean Jabs, M.D., Dr. Franklin D. Richards, M.D., Dr. Keshav Magge, M.D., and the professional team at Cosmetic Surgery Associates, make it a priority to stay well-informed about all of the latest trends and technological advances in the field of non-surgical cosmetic treatments, in order to offer their patients the very latest and most cutting edge treatments available.

Botox
Dermal Fillers

Skin Care

Why Choose Non-Surgical Procedures

Patients are attracted to non-surgical cosmetic procedures that keep them looking refreshed and youthful, require little or no post-procedure down time, and can be performed in less than 30 minutes. Non-surgical cosmetic procedures enable our patients to correct troubling aesthetic problems without disrupting their busy lives.
Minimally invasive cosmetic procedures are also appealing because they can be performed at a more affordable cost, on an outpatient basis, with reduced healing times and immediate results. With the latest technological advances in non-surgical cosmetic procedures, even our busiest patients can schedule treatments during their lunch hour, and return back to work looking revitalized and rejuvenated!

About The Skin
The skin, our body’s largest organ is both a complex and multipurpose organ. It protects the body against injury, chemicals, bacteria and even UV light. It regulates body temperature, and is a vital part of our immune system. In addition it has the wonderful power to constantly repair itself.

The skin is made of three layers. The epidermis (the outermost layer-which has five sublayers) the dermis (the middle or supporting layer) and the subcutis (bottom or fatty layer).

The epidermis, the layer we see and touch is very tough but microscopically thin. It is the layer with the highest content of water. However, as we mature, the skin’s ability to retain water decreases which causes the skin to become dehydrated. This is why many of us feel the need to use a moisturizer when we reach our mid 20’s. The melanocytes (the cells responsible for skin’s pigment) are present in the lower layers of the epidermis. These protective cells produce pigment (melanin) in response to ultraviolet rays, skin trauma, and/or hormones. Melanocytes migrate into individual cells to form a physical umbrella over the cell’s nucleus. This “brown umbrella” (a suntan) is created to protect the cell’s nucleus from even further sun damage and sunburn. 

Because a tan is created only when the skin is confronted with injury, there is NO such thing as a healthy tan (unless it comes from a self tanner). When severe damage has occurred and as we mature, these cells often coagulate into clumps causing hyperpigmentation (age spots).

The dermis (middle layer) is often referred to as the living skin. This layer is made of collagen (95%) and elastin ( 3 %) protein fibers that are woven together in a microscopic network. Collagen enables the skin to stretch and elastin brings it back to form. Elasticity depends on a well balanced water content in the dermis and other skin layers. The dermal layer is also responsible for supporting the epidermis the skin’s repair, immune system and sensory system.
The subcutis (the bottom layer) consists mainly of fat and cells interspersed with blood vessels, nerve fibers and muscle fibers. This layer acts as a protective cushion for what lies above it and below it.
Frequently Asked Questions
How our skin ages
The skin, which has the ability to renew itself, goes through a natural shedding process called desquamation. This cellular renewal takes about 30 days in normal skin. However as we age, this natural shedding process slows down. In addition, collagen production declines as well as the skin’s natural moisture level. Furthermore, the subcutis fat begins to thin and facial muscles begin to sag.
This natural aging process is inevitable. However, many of our lifestyle choices make our skin age before it’s time. Activities such as smoking, sunbathing, excessive alcohol consumption, a poor diet, and lack of sleep all take a toll on our skin. Terms such as “weathered skin” , “photoaging” and “premature aging” are often used to describe such skin.
The good news is that we can do something about it.
Why peel your skin?
Artificially removing the outer layer of skin by a process called peeling or exfoliating helps speed up the body’s natural process of skin renewal. The skin grows back without replicating many of the problems that have developed during its life—such as fine lines, sun damage, dark spots etc. Consistently removing the outer layers of skin (epidermis) results in a skin that is well hydrated, less pigmented and more youthful looking.
What is Chemical Peeling?
Chemical peeling involves applying an acidic solution to the skin. The most popular chemical peels are glycolic acid (made from sugar cane) and lactic acid (made from milk). These chemicals are also called alpha hydroxy acids. The chemical solution promotes the shedding of the skin by breaking down the substance that holds the skin cells together. The extent of the exfoliation depends on the type of acid, its pH and the condition of your skin.
Chemical peels have a cumulative effect and are best done is a series of 4-6 treatments.
Benefits Of A Chemical Peel


Smoother skin surface and texture
Minimized appearance of lines and wrinkles
Increased production of collagen and elastin
Reduction of Hyperpigmentation


Salicylic acid (betahydroxy acid) another popular chemical peel contains the same active ingredient found in aspirin. Although this acid is similar to alphahydroxy acids, it has the added ability to penetrate the skin’s pores because it is lipid (oil) soluble. This type of acid peel is excellent for refining clogged pores and reducing skin’s breakouts. Because this acid is related to aspirin, it is an anti-inflammatory and is a great treatment for acne and rosacea.
Benefits Of Salicylic Acid


Comedones
Epidermal pigmentation problems
Fine lines and wrinkles
Large Pores
Shallow Scarring
Skin Laxity

Alastin Skincare Product Description

The Alastin Skincare range includes a variety of products that are designed to be part of a full skincare range. Alastin produces cleansers, moisturizers, eye creams and more specialized products that are designed to be used after cosmetic procedures have been performed on the skin (their ‘Invasive’ line). Most of the products use the Alastin TriHex Technology which is a blend of peptides that may help support collagen and elastin levels, inflammation response and maintain the rejuvenation of the skin overtime. Each product has a separate page of information that includes an overview of what it is used for, the main benefits and the key active ingredients. For example the Ultra Nourishing Moisturizer with TriHex Technology supports the nourishment and hydration of the face, neck and chest area using a blend of natural ingredients in a fragrance free formula. This particular product should be used in the morning and evening and the website suggests other products in the range that work in conjunction with the formula. All of the Alastin Skincare products are said to support the skin’s structural and biochemical matrix, strengthening and stimulating the skin on a long term basis.
Good about Alastin Skincare 

Alastin Skincare is an established and reputable company
All product key ingredients are listed
Company history and contact details are provided
Some of the products are well priced
The products use TriHex Technology
There is a 30 day refund offered
Scientific data is shown

Bad about Alastin Skincare

No full ingredient lists are shown
Some products in the range are costly
No before and after photos are shown

Alastin Skincare The Bottom Line
While Alastin Skincare may not be as well known as some brands of skincare on the market, they do appear to produce some good quality products that have been extensively tested for their effects on aging skin. Using some of the products in the Invasive range may help the skin recover after a surgical procedure while the others in the range may, overtime, keep the skin healthy and strong by providing essential peptides and other botanical ingredients. It would be helpful if the company offered free samples but they do have a reasonably good refund term for consumers.
