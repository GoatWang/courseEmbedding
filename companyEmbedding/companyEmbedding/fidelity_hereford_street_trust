1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING                                                       
POLICIES.                                                                       
Spartan Money Market Fund (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Summer Street        
Trust (the trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares.     
The trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as            
amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company            
organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The following summarizes the       
significant accounting policies of the fund:                                    
SECURITY VALUATION. As permitted under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, and           
certain conditions therein, securities are valued initially at cost and         
thereafter assume a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or        
premium.                                                                        
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter      
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to      
the extent that it distributes all of its taxable income for its fiscal         
year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding income         
taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."                               
INTEREST INCOME. Interest income, which includes amortization of premium        
and accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as earned.                 
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.      
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the        
funds in the trust.                                                             
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends are declared daily and paid            
monthly from net interest income.                                               
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with         
income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting      
principles.                                                                     
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Effective May 1,
1993, the fund adopted Statement of Position 93-2: Determination,               
Disclosure, and Financial Statement Presentation of Income, Capital Gain,       
and Return of Capital Distributions by Investment Companies. As a result,       
the fund changed the classification of distributions to shareholders to         
better disclose the differences between financial statement amounts and         
distributions determined in accordance with income tax regulations.             
Accordingly, amounts as of April 30, 1993 have been reclassified to reflect     
an increase in paid in capital and a decrease in accumulated net realized       
gain on investments of $511,000.                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The fund, through its custodian, receives delivery       
of the underlying securities, whose market value is required to be at least     
102% of the resale price at the time of purchase. The fund's investment         
adviser, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company (FMR), is responsible       
for                                                                             
2. OPERATING POLICIES -                                                         
CONTINUED                                                                       
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - CONTINUED                                               
determining that the value of these underlying securities remains at least      
equal to the resale price.                                                      
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund, along with other registered       
investment companies having management contracts with FMR, may transfer         
uninvested cash balances into a joint trading account. These balances are       
invested in one or more repurchase agreements that are collateralized by        
U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                                    
RESTRICTED SECURITIES. The fund is permitted to invest in privately placed      
restricted securities. These securities may be resold in transactions           
exempt from registration or to the public if the securities are registered.     
Disposal of these securities may involve time-consuming negotiations and        
expense, and prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult. At the        
end of the period, restricted securities (excluding 144A issues) amounted       
to $245,000,000 or 3.8% of net assets.                                          
3. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, FMR pays all expenses         
except the compensation of the non-interested Trustees and certain              
exceptions such as interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and extraordinary     
expenses. FMR receives a fee that is computed daily at an annual rate of        
.30% of the fund's average net assets, plus 6% of that portion of gross         
income that represents a gross yield in excess of 5%. The maximum fee rate      
cannot exceed .60% of the fund's average net assets for the month. In           
addition, through December 31, 1995, FMR has agreed to limit the fund's         
total operating expenses to an annual rate of .45% of average net assets.       
On March 23, 1994, the shareholders of the fund voted to approve a proposal     
to amend the management contract replacing the variable management fee          
described above with a fixed flat fee of .45% of average net assets. The        
new contract went into effect April 1, 1994 and will continue through May
31, 1994, subject to continuation by the fund's Board of Trustees. For the      
period, the management fee was equivalent to an annual rate of .32% of          
average net assets.                                                             
FMR also bears the cost of providing shareholder services to the fund. For      
the period, FMR or its affiliates collected certain transaction fees from       
shareholders which aggregated $321,675.                                         
SUB-ADVISER FEE. As the fund's investment sub-adviser, FMR Texas Inc., a        
wholly owned subsidiary of FMR, receives a fee from FMR of 50% of the           
management fee payable to FMR. The fee is paid prior to any voluntary           
expense reimbursements which may be in effect, and after reducing the fee       
for any payments by FMR pursuant to the fund's Distribution and Service         
Plan.                                                                           
4. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                          
Effective April 1, 1994, FMR voluntarily agreed to reimburse the fund's         
management fee above an annual rate of .37% of average net assets until         
further notice. For the period, the reimbursement reduced the expenses by       
$398,000. Effective May 1, 1994, this expense limitation was increased to       
.39% of average net assets.                                                     
5. SHAREHOLDER MEETING.                                                         
At a special meeting of the shareholders of the fund held on March 23,
1994, shareholders approved amendments to certain fundamental investment        
limitations of the fund.                                                        
In addition, shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of Conversion and      
Termination (the Plan of Conversion), providing for the conversion of the       
fund (the current fund) from a separate series of Fidelity Summer Street        
Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, to a separate series (the successor      
fund) of Fidelity Hereford Street Trust, a Delaware business trust,             
effective June 17, 1994. The individual investment objective, policies and      
limitations of the successor fund will be identical to those of the current     
fund. In connection with the Plan of Conversion, a new management contract,     
new sub-advisory agreement and new distribution plan identical to those         
currently in effect for the current fund will take effect on June 17, 1994.     
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                                               

To the Trustees of Fidelity Summer Street Trust and the Shareholders of         
Spartan                                                                         
Money Market Fund:                                                              
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of         
Fidelity Summer Street Trust: Spartan Money Market Fund, including the          
schedule of portfolio investments, as of April 30, 1994, and the related        
statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes      
in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the        
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.       
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility      
of the fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on        
these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.        
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and          
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of            
securities owned as of April 30, 1994 by correspondence with the custodian      
and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles         
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating        
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits        
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                                     
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred      
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position       
of Fidelity Summer Street Trust: Spartan Money Market Fund, the results of      
its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for       
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial               
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in              
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Description of Principal Security Types

Money market securities are high-quality, short-term securities that pay a fixed, variable, or floating interest rate.
Securities are often specifically structured so that they are eligible investments for a money market fund. For example, in
order to satisfy the maturity restrictions for a money market fund, some money market securities have demand or put
features, which have the effect of shortening the security's maturity. Money market securities include bank certificates of
deposit, bankers' acceptances, bank time deposits, notes, commercial paper, and U.S. Government securities.

Prospectus

Fund Basics - continued

U.S. Government securities are high-quality securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by an agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. Government. U.S. Government securities may be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
Treasury, the right to borrow from the U.S. Treasury, or the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the security.

A repurchase agreement is an agreement to buy a security at one price and a simultaneous agreement to sell it back at an
agreed-upon price.

Principal Investment Risks

Many factors affect each fund's performance. A fund's yield will change daily based on changes in interest rates and other
market conditions. Although each fund is managed to maintain a stable $1.00 share price, there is no guarantee that the
fund will be able to do so. For example, a major increase in interest rates or a decrease<R> in the credit quality of the
issuer of one of a fund's investments could cause the fund's share price to decrease. It is important to note that neither the
funds' share prices nor</R> their yields are guaranteed by the U.S. Government.

The following factors can significantly affect a fund's performance:

Interest Rate Changes. Money market securities have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In general,
the price of a money market security can fall when interest rates rise and can rise when interest rates fall. Securities with
longer maturities and the securities of issuers in the financial services sector can be more sensitive to interest rate
changes. Short-term securities tend to react to changes in short-term interest rates.

Foreign Exposure. Issuers located in foreign countries and entities providing credit support or a maturity-shortening
structure that are located in foreign countries can involve increased risks. Extensive public information about the issuer or
provider may not be available and unfavorable political, economic, or governmental developments could affect the value of
the security.

Financial Services Exposure. Financial services companies are highly dependent on the supply of short-term financing.
The value of securities of issuers in the financial services sector can be sensitive to changes in government regulation and
interest rates and to economic downturns in the United States and abroad.

Issuer-Specific Changes. Changes in the financial condition of an issuer, changes in specific economic or political
conditions that affect a particular type of issuer, and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect the credit
quality or value of an issuer's securities. Entities providing credit support or a maturity-shortening structure also can be
affected by these types of changes. If the structure of a security fails to function as intended, the security could decline in
value.

<R>Shareholder Notice</R>

<R>The following policies are subject to change only upon 60 days' prior notice to shareholders:</R>

<R></R>Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in U.S. Treasury

<R></R>Spartan U.S. Government Money Market Fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in U.S.
Government securities and repurchase agreements for those securities.

Valuing Shares

Each fund is open for business each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open.

Each fund's net asset value per share (NAV) is the value of a single share. Fidelity normally calculates each fund's NAV as of the
close of business of the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. However, NAV may be calculated earlier if trading on the NYSE
is restricted or as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Each fund's assets are valued as of this time
for the purpose of computing the fund's NAV. 

To the extent that each fund's assets are traded in other markets on days when the fund is <R>not open for business, the
value of the fund's assets may be affected on those days.</R> In addition, trading in some of a fund's assets may not occur
on days when the fund is open for business.

Each fund's assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost.

General Information

Fidelity Investments was established in 1946 to manage one of America's first mutual funds. Today, Fidelity is the largest
mutual fund company in the country, and is known as an innovative provider of high-quality financial services to individuals
and institutions.

In addition to its mutual fund business, the company operates one of America's leading brokerage firms, Fidelity Brokerage
Services LLC <R>(FBS LLC)</R>. Fidelity is also a leader in providing tax-advantaged retirement plans for individuals
investing on their own or through their employer.

You may buy or sell shares of a fund through a Fidelity brokerage account or a Fidelity mutual fund account. If you buy or sell
shares of a fund (other than by exchange) through a Fidelity brokerage account, your transactions generally involve your
Fidelity brokerage core (a settlement vehicle included as part of your Fidelity brokerage account).

If you do not currently have a Fidelity brokerage account or a Fidelity mutual fund account and would like to invest in a fund,
you may need to complete an application. For more information about a Fidelity brokerage account or a Fidelity mutual fund
account, please visit Fidelity's web site at www.fidelity.com, call 1-800-FIDELITY, or visit a Fidelity Investor Center (call
1-800-544-9797 for the center nearest you).

You may also buy or sell shares of the funds through a retirement account (such as an IRA or an account funded through
salary deduction) or an investment professional. Retirement specialists are available at 1-800-544-4774 to answer your
questions about Fidelity retirement products. If you buy or sell shares of a fund through a retirement account or an investment
professional, the procedures for buying, selling, and exchanging shares of the fund and the account features and policies may
differ from those discussed in this prospectus. Fees in addition to those discussed in this prospectus may also apply. For
example, you may be charged a transaction fee if you buy or sell shares of a fund through a non-Fidelity broker or other
investment professional.

There is no minimum balance or initial or subsequent purchase minimum for investments through Portfolio Advisory
ServicesSM , a mutual fund or a qualified state tuition program for which FMR or an affiliate serves as investment manager,
certain Fidelity retirement accounts funded through salary deduction, or fund positions opened with the proceeds of
distributions from such retirement accounts. In addition, each fund may waive or lower purchase minimums in other
circumstances.

Buying Shares

The price to buy one share of each fund is the fund's NAV. Each fund's shares are sold without a sales charge.

Your shares will be bought at the next NAV calculated after your investment is received in proper form.

<R>A fund may reject or cancel any purchase orders, including exchanges, for any reason.</R>

<R>For example, the funds do not permit market timing because short-term or other</R> excessive trading into and out of a
fund may harm performance by disrupting portfolio management strategies and by increasing expenses. <R>Accordingly, a fund
may reject any purchase orders, including exchanges, from market timers or investors that, in FMR's opinion, may be disruptive
to that fund.</R> For these purposes, FMR may consider an investor's trading history in that fund or other Fidelity funds, and
accounts under common ownership or control.

Each fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares only on a limited basis, for a period of time or
permanently.

If you place an order to buy shares and your payment is not received and collected, your purchase may be canceled and
you could be liable for any losses or fees a fund or Fidelity has incurred.

Selling Shares 

The price to sell one share of each fund is the fund's NAV.

Your shares will be sold at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in proper form.

Certain requests must include a signature guarantee. It is designed to protect you and Fidelity from fraud. If you hold your
shares in a Fidelity mutual fund account, your request must be made in writing and include a signature guarantee if any of
the following situations apply:

Prospectus


You wish to sell more than $100,000 worth of shares;
The address on your account (record address) has changed within the last 15 or 30 days, depending on your account, and
you wish to sell $10,000 or more of shares;
You are requesting that a check be mailed to a different address than the record address;
You are requesting that redemption proceeds be paid to someone other than the account owner; or
The redemption proceeds are being transferred to a Fidelity mutual fund account with a different registration.

You should be able to obtain a signature guarantee from a bank, broker (including Fidelity Investor Centers), dealer, credit
union (if authorized under state law), securities exchange or association, clearing agency, or savings association. A notary
public cannot provide a signature guarantee.

When you place an order to sell shares, note the following:


If you are selling some but not all of your shares, keep your fund balance above $10,000 to keep your fund position open
($10,000 for fund balances in retirement accounts), except fund positions not subject to balance minimums.
Normally, redemptions will be processed by the next business day, but may take up to seven days to be processed if making
immediate payment would adversely affect a fund.
Redemption proceeds (other than exchanges) may be delayed until money from prior purchases sufficient to cover your
redemption has been received and collected. This can take up to seven business days after a purchase.
Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the NYSE is closed (other than weekends or holidays),
when trading on the NYSE is restricted, or as permitted by the SEC.
Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or other property rather than in cash if FMR determines it is in the best
interests of a fund.
If you hold your shares in a Fidelity mutual fund account and you sell shares by writing a check and the amount of the
check is greater than the value of your fund position, your check will be returned to you and you may be subject to additional
charges.
You will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed redemption checks.

To sell shares issued with certificates, call Fidelity for instructions. Each fund no longer issues share certificates.

Exchanging Shares

An exchange involves the redemption of all or a portion of the shares of one fund and the purchase of shares of another
fund.

Prospectus

Shareholder Information - continued

As a shareholder, you have the privilege of exchanging shares of a fund for shares of other Fidelity funds.

However, you should note the following policies and restrictions governing exchanges:


Each fund may temporarily or permanently terminate the exchange privilege of any investor who makes more than four
exchanges out of the fund per calendar year. Accounts under common ownership or control will be counted together for
purposes of the four exchange limit.
The exchange limit may be modified for accounts held by certain institutional retirement plans to conform to plan
exchange limits and Department of Labor regulations. See your retirement plan materials for further information.
<R>Each fund may refuse any exchange purchases for any reason. For example</R>, <R>each fund may refuse
</R>exchange purchases by any person or group if, in FMR's judgment, the fund would be unable to invest the money
effectively in accordance with its investment objective and policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected.
Before exchanging into a fund, read its prospectus.
The fund you are exchanging into must be available for sale in your state.
Exchanges may have tax consequences for you.
If you are exchanging between accounts that are not registered in the same name, address, and taxpayer identification
number, there may be additional requirements.

The funds may terminate or modify the exchange privileges in the future.

Other funds may have different exchange restrictions, and may impose trading fees of up to 2.00% of the amount exchanged.
Check each fund's prospectus for details.

investor. Fidelity will request personalized security codes or other information, and may also record calls. For transactions
conducted through the Internet, Fidelity recommends the use of an Internet browser with 128-bit encryption. You should
verify the accuracy of your confirmation statements immediately after you receive them. If you do not want the ability to sell
and exchange by telephone, call Fidelity for instructions.

Prospectus

Shareholder Information - continued

Fidelity may deduct a small balance maintenance fee of $12.00 from a fund balance with a value of less than $2,000. It
is expected that fund balances will be valued on the second Friday in November of each calendar year. Fund positions
opened after September 30 will not be subject to the fee for that calendar year. The fee, which is payable to Fidelity, is
designed to offset in part the relatively higher costs of servicing smaller fund positions. This fee will not be deducted from
fund positions opened after January 1 of that calendar year if those positions use regular investment plans.

You will be given 30 days' notice to reestablish the minimum balance if your fund balance falls below $10,000, <R>for any
reason, including solely due to declines in a fund's NAV. </R>If you do not increase your balance, Fidelity may sell all of your
shares and send the proceeds to you. Your shares will be sold at the NAV on the day Fidelity closes your fund position and the
fund closeout fee will be charged. Certain fund positions are not subject to these balance requirements and will not be closed
for failure to maintain a minimum balance.

Fidelity may charge a fee for certain services, such as providing historical account documents.

Dividends and Capital Gain Distributions

Each fund earns interest, dividends, and other income from its investments, and distributes this income (less expenses) to
shareholders as dividends. Each fund may also realize capital gains from its investments, and distributes these gains (less
losses), if any, to shareholders as capital gain distributions.

Distributions you receive from each fund consist primarily of dividends. Each fund normally declares dividends daily and
pays them monthly.

Earning Dividends

Shares begin to earn dividends on the first business day following the day of purchase.

Shares earn dividends until, but not including, the next business day following the day of redemption.

Distribution Options 

When you open an account, specify on your application how you want to receive your distributions. The following distribution
options are available for each fund:

1. Reinvestment Option. Your dividends and capital gain distributions, if any, will be automatically reinvested in
additional shares of the fund. If you do not indicate a choice on your application, you will be assigned this option.

2. Cash Option. Your dividends and capital gain distributions, if any, will be paid in cash.

3. Directed Dividends® Option. Your dividends will be automatically invested in shares of another identically registered
Fidelity fund. Your capital gain distributions, if any, will be automatically invested in shares of another identically registered
Fidelity fund, automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund, or paid in cash.

Prospectus

If the distribution option you prefer is not listed on your account application, or if you want to change your current
distribution option, visit Fidelity's web site at www.fidelity.com or call 1-800-544-6666 for more information.

If you elect to receive distributions paid in cash by check and the U.S. Postal Service does not deliver your checks, your
distribution option may be converted to the Reinvestment Option. You will not receive interest on amounts represented by
uncashed distribution checks.

Tax Consequences

As with any investment, your investment in a fund could have tax consequences for you. If you are not investing through a
tax-advantaged retirement account, you should consider these tax consequences.

Distributions you receive from each fund are subject to federal income tax, and may also be subject to state or local taxes.

<R>For federal tax purposes, certain of each fund's distributions, including </R>dividends and distributions of short-term
capital gains, are taxable to you as ordinary income, while <R>certain of each fund's distributions, including distribu</R>tions
of long-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you generally as capital gains.

Any taxable distributions you receive from a fund will normally be taxable to you when you receive them, regardless of your
distribution option. If you elect to receive distributions in cash or to invest distributions automatically in shares of another
Fidelity fund, you will receive certain December distributions in January, but those distributions will be taxable as if you
received them on December 31.

Fund Services
Fund Management

Each fund is a mutual fund, an investment that pools shareholders' money and invests it toward a specified goal.

<R>FMR is each fund's manager. The address of FMR and its affiliates, unless otherwise indicated below, is 82 Devonshire
Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.</R>

As of <R>March 28, 2002</R>, FMR had approximately $<R>13.6</R> billion in discretionary assets under management.

As the manager, FMR is responsible for choosing each fund's investments and handling its business affairs.

Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (FIMM), at 1 Spartan Way, Merrimack, New Hampshire 03054, serves as a
sub-adviser for each fund. FIMM is primarily responsible for choosing investments for each fund.

FIMM is an affiliate of FMR. As of <R>March 28, 2002</R>, FIMM had approximately $<R>330.6 billion</R> in
discretionary assets under management.

From time to time a manager, analyst, or other Fidelity employee may express views regarding a particular company, security,
industry, or market sector. The views expressed by any such person are the views of only that individual as of the time
expressed and do not necessarily represent the views of Fidelity or any other person in the Fidelity organization. Any such
views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and Fidelity disclaims any responsibility to
update such views. These views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment decisions for a Fidelity
fund are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Fidelity fund.

Each fund pays a management fee to FMR. The management fee is calculated and paid to FMR every month. FMR pays all of
the other expenses of each fund with limited exceptions.

Each fund's annual management fee rate is 0.42% of its average net assets.

On July 1, 2001, FMR reduced the management fee rate for each fund from 0.45% to 0.42%.

FMR pays FIMM for providing sub-advisory services.

FMR may, from time to time, agree to reimburse the funds for management fees above a specified limit. FMR retains the
ability to be repaid by a fund if expenses fall below the specified limit prior to the end of the fiscal year. Reimbursement
arrangements, which may be discontinued by FMR at any time, can decrease a fund's expenses and boost its performance.

Fund Distribution

Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC) distributes each fund's shares.

Each fund has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940
that recognizes that FMR may use its management fee revenues, as well as its past profits or its resources from any other
source, to pay FDC for expenses incurred in connection with providing services intended to result in the sale of fund shares
and/or shareholder support services. FMR, directly or through FDC, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries, such as
banks, broker-dealers, and other service-providers, that provide those services. Currently, the Board of Trustees of each fund
has authorized such payments.

Prospectus

Fund Services - continued

If payments made by FMR to FDC or to intermediaries under a Distribution and Service Plan were considered to be paid out
of a fund's assets on an ongoing basis, they might increase the cost of your investment and might cost you more than paying
other types of sales charges.

To receive payments made pursuant to a Distribution and Service Plan, intermediaries must sign the appropriate agreement
with FDC in advance.

From time to time, FDC may offer special promotional programs to investors who purchase shares of Fidelity funds. For
example, FDC may offer merchandise, discounts, vouchers, or similar items to investors who purchase shares of certain
Fidelity funds during certain periods. To determine if you qualify for any such programs, contact Fidelity or visit our web site
at www.fidelity.com.

FMR may allocate brokerage transactions in a manner that takes into account the sale of shares of a fund, provided that the
fund receives brokerage services and commission rates comparable to those of other broker-dealers.

No dealer, sales representative, or any other person has been authorized to give any information or to make any
representations, other than those contained in this prospectus and in the related statement of additional information
(SAI), in connection with the offer contained in this prospectus. If given or made, such other information or
representations must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the funds or FDC. This prospectus and the related
SAI do not constitute an offer by the funds or by FDC to sell shares of the funds to or to buy shares of the funds from any
person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer.

Financial Highlights

The financial highlights tables are intended to help you understand each fund's financial history for the past 5 years. Certain
information reflects financial results for a single fund share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor
would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). This
information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, whose report, along with each fund's

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND LIMITATIONS

The following policies and limitations supplement those set forth in the prospectus. Unless otherwise noted, whenever
an investment policy or limitation states a maximum percentage of a fund's assets that may be invested in any security or
other asset, or sets forth a policy regarding quality standards, such standard or percentage limitation will be determined
immediately after and as a result of the fund's acquisition of such security or other asset. Accordingly, any subsequent
change in values, net assets, or other circumstances will not be considered when determining whether the investment
complies with the fund's investment policies and limitations.

A fund's fundamental investment policies and limitations cannot be changed without approval by a "majority of the
outstanding voting securities" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act)) of the fund. However,
except for the fundamental investment limitations listed below, the investment policies and limitations described in this SAI
are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval.

Investment Limitations of Spartan® U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund

The following are the fund's fundamental investment limitations set forth in their entirety. The fund may not:

(1)  purchase the securities of any issuer if, as a result, the fund would not comply with any applicable diversification
requirements for a money market fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder, as such may be
amended from time to time;

(2)  issue senior securities, except in connection with the insurance program established by the fund pursuant to an
exemptive order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission or as otherwise permitted under the Investment Company
Act of 1940;

(3)  sell securities short, unless it owns, or by virtue of ownership of other securities has the right to obtain, securities
equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short, and provided that transactions in futures contracts are not deemed to
constitute short sales;

(4)  purchase securities on margin, except that the fund may obtain such short-term credits as are necessary for the
clearance of transactions, and provided that the fund may make initial and variation margin payments in connection with
transactions in futures contracts and options on futures contracts;

(5)  borrow money, except that the fund may (i) borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes (not for
leveraging or investment) and (ii) engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose; provided that (i) and (ii) in
combination do not exceed 33 1/3% of the fund's total assets (including the amount borrowed) less liabilities (other than
borrowings). Any borrowings that come to exceed this amount will be reduced within three days (not including Sundays
and holidays) to the extent necessary to comply with the 33 1/3% limitation;

(6)  <R>underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the fund may be considered an underwriter
within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities or in connection with investments in
other i</R>nvestment companies;

(7)  purchase the securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities) if, as a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be invested in the securities of
companies whose principal business activities are in the same industry;

(8)  purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments (but this shall not
prevent the fund from investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or securities of companies engaged in
the real estate business);

(9)  purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities (but this shall not prevent
the fund from purchasing and selling futures contracts); or

(10)  <R>lend any security or make any other loan if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other
parties, but this limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements, or to acquisitions of
loans, loan participations or other forms of debt instrum</R>ents.

(11)  The fund may, notwithstanding any other fundamental investment policy or limitation, invest all of its assets in the
securities of a single open-end management investment company managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company or
an affiliate or successor with substantially the same fundamental investment objective, policies, and limitations as the fund.

The following investment limitations are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval.

(i)  The fund does not currently intend to purchase a security (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities or securities of other money market funds) if, as a result, more than
5% of its total assets would be invested in the securities of a single issuer; provided that the fund may invest up to 25% of its
total assets in the first tier securities of a single issuer for up to three business days.

(ii)  The fund may borrow money only (a) from a bank or from a registered investment company or portfolio for which
FMR or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or (b) by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements with any party.

(iii)  The fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if, as a result, more than 10% of its net assets would be
invested in securities that are deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or
because they cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are
valued.

(iv)  The fund does not currently intend to make loans, but this limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or
to repurchase agreements.

(v)  The fund does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in the securities of a single open-end management
investment company managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company or an affiliate or successor with substantially
the same fundamental investment objective, policies, and limitations as the fund.

For purposes of limitations (1) and (i), certain securities subject to guarantees (including insurance, letters of credit and
demand features) are not considered securities of their issuer, but are subject to separate diversification requirements, in
accordance with industry standard requirements for money market funds.

With respect to limitation (iii), if through a change in values, net assets, or other circumstances, the fund were in a
position where more than 10% of its net assets were invested in illiquid securities, it would consider appropriate steps to
protect liquidity.

clearance of transactions, and provided that payment of initial and variation margin payments in connection with transactions
in futures contracts and options on futures contracts shall not constitute purchasing securities on margin;

prevent the fund from investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or securities of companies engaged in
the real estate business);

(9)  purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities (but this shall not prevent
the fund from purchasing and selling futures contracts); or

parties, but this limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements, or to acquisitions of
loans, loan participations or other forms of debt instru</R>ments.

(11)  The fund may, notwithstanding any other fundamental investment policy or limitation, invest all of its assets in the

objective, policies, and limitations as the fund.

The following limitations are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval.

protect liquidity.

The following pages contain more detailed information about types of instruments in which a fund may invest, strategies
Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) may employ in pursuit of a fund's investment objective, and a summary
of related risks. FMR may not buy all of these instruments or use all of these techniques unless it believes that doing so will
help a fund achieve its goal.

Affiliated Bank Transactions. A fund may engage in transactions with financial institutions that are, or may be
considered to be, "affiliated persons" of the fund under the 1940 Act. These transactions may involve repurchase agreements
with custodian banks; short-term obligations of, and repurchase agreements with, the 50 largest U.S. banks (measured by
deposits); municipal securities; U.S. Government securities with affiliated financial institutions that are primary dealers in
these securities; short-term currency transactions; and short-term borrowings. In accordance with exemptive orders issued by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Trustees has established and periodically reviews procedures
applicable to transactions involving affiliated financial institutions.

Asset-Backed Securities represent interests in pools of mortgages, loans, receivables, or other assets. Payment of
interest and repayment of principal may be largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by the assets backing the
securities and, in certain cases, supported by letters of credit, surety bonds, or other credit enhancements. Asset-backed
security values may also be affected by other factors including changes in interest rates, the availability of information
concerning the pool and its structure, the creditworthiness of the servicing agent for the pool, the originator of the loans or
receivables, or the entities providing the credit enhancement. In addition, these securities may be subject to prepayment risk.

Borrowing. Each fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by FMR or its affiliates, or through reverse
repurchase agreements, and may make additional investments while borrowings are outstanding.

Cash Management. A fund can hold uninvested cash.

Central Funds are money market or short-term bond funds managed by FMR or its affiliates. The money market
central funds seek to earn a high level of current income (free from federal income tax in the case of a municipal money
market fund) while maintaining a stable $1.00 share price. The money market central funds comply with industry-standard
requirements for money market funds regarding the quality, maturity, and diversification of their investments. The
short-term bond central funds seek to obtain a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital.

Domestic and Foreign Investments include U.S. dollar-denominated time deposits, certificates of deposit, and
bankers' acceptances of U.S. banks and their branches located outside of the United States, U.S. branches and agencies of
foreign banks, and foreign branches of foreign banks. Domestic and foreign investments may also include U.S.
dollar-denominated securities issued or guaranteed by other U.S. or foreign issuers, including U.S. and foreign corporations
or other business organizations, foreign governments, foreign government agencies or instrumentalities, and U.S. and
foreign financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, insurance companies, mortgage bankers, and real
estate investment trusts, as well as banks.

<R>The obligations of foreign branches of U.S. banks may not be obligations of the parent bank in addition to the
issuing branch, and may be limited by the terms of a specific obligation and by governmental regulation. Payment of interest
and repayment of principal on</R> these obligations may also be affected by governmental action in the country of
domicile of the branch (generally referred to as sovereign <R>risk) or by war or civil conflict.</R> In addition, evidence of
ownership of portfolio securities may be held outside of the United States and a fund may be subject to the risks associated
with the holding of such property overseas. Various provisions of federal law governing the establishment and operation of
U.S. branches do not apply to foreign branches of U.S. banks.

Obligations of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks may be general obligations of the parent bank in addition to
the issuing branch, or may be limited by the terms of a specific obligation and by federal and state regulation, as well as by
governmental action in the country in which the foreign bank has its head office.

Obligations of foreign issuers involve certain additional risks. These risks may include future unfavorable political and
economic developments, withholding taxes, seizures of foreign deposits, currency controls, interest limitations, or other
governmental restrictions that might affect repayment of principal or payment of interest, or the ability to honor a credit
commitment. Additionally, there may be less public information available about foreign entities. Foreign issuers may be
subject to less governmental regulation and supervision than U.S. issuers. Foreign issuers also generally are not bound by
uniform accounting, auditing, and financial reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. issuers.

Illiquid Securities cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which
they are valued. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or may be costly to a fund. Under the supervision of the
Board of Trustees, FMR determines the liquidity of a fund's investments and, through reports from FMR, the Board monitors
investments in illiquid securities. In determining the liquidity of a fund's investments, FMR may consider various factors,
including (1) the frequency and volume of trades and quotations, (2) the number of dealers and prospective purchasers in the
marketplace, (3) dealer undertakings to make a market, and (4) the nature of the security and the market in which it trades
(including any demand, put or tender features, the mechanics and other requirements for transfer, any letters of credit or other
credit enhancement features, any ratings, the number of holders, the method of soliciting offers, the time required to dispose of
the security, and the ability to assign or offset the rights and obligations of the security).

Interfund Borrowing and Lending Program. Pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC, a fund may lend
money to, and borrow money from, other funds advised by FMR or its affiliates. Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market
currently intends to participate in this program only as a borrower. A fund will borrow through the program only when the
costs are equal to or lower than the costs of bank loans, and will lend through the program only when the returns are higher
than those available from an investment in repurchase agreements. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend
overnight, but can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one day's notice. A fund may have to
borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed. Any delay in repayment to a lending
fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional borrowing costs.

Money Market Securities are high-quality, short-term obligations. Money market securities may be structured to be,
or may employ a trust or other form so that they are, eligible investments for money market funds. For example, put features
can be used to modify the maturity of a security or interest rate adjustment features can be used to enhance price stability. If a
structure fails to function as intended, adverse tax or investment consequences may result. Neither the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) nor any other regulatory authority has ruled definitively on certain legal issues presented by certain structured
securities. Future tax or other regulatory determinations could adversely affect the value, liquidity, or tax treatment of the
income received from these securities or the nature and timing of distributions made by the funds.

Municipal Securities are issued to raise money for a variety of public or private purposes, including general financing
for state and local governments, or financing for specific projects or public facilities. They may be issued in anticipation of
future revenues and may be backed by the full taxing power of a municipality, the revenues from a specific project, or the
credit of a private organization. The value of some or all municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the
municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal
securities holders. A municipal security may be owned directly or through a participation interest.

Put Features entitle the holder to sell a security back to the issuer or a third party at any time or at specified intervals. In
exchange for this benefit, a fund may accept a lower interest rate. Securities with put features are subject to the risk that the
put provider is unable to honor the put feature (purchase the security). Put providers often support their ability to buy
securities on demand by obtaining letters of credit or other guarantees from other entities. Demand features, standby
commitments, and tender options are types of put features.

Repurchase Agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller
at an agreed-upon price. The resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreed-upon incremental amount which is
unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security. As protection against the risk that the original seller will
not fulfill its obligation, the securities are held in a separate account at a bank, marked-to-market daily, and maintained at a
value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount. The value of the security purchased may be more
or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security. In addition, delays or losses could result
if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent. The funds will engage in repurchase agreement
transactions with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by FMR.

Restricted Securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or
be costly to a fund. Restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to an exemption
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 <R>(the 1933 Act),</R> or in a registered public offering. Where
registration is required, the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a
considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a
security under an effective registration statement. If, during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop, the
holder might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements. In a reverse repurchase agreement, a fund sells a security to another party, such as a
bank or broker-dealer, in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreed-upon price and time. The funds
will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory
by FMR. Such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and a fund's yield and may be
viewed as a form of leverage.

Short Sales "Against the Box" are short sales of securities that a fund owns or has the right to obtain (equivalent in kind
or amount to the securities sold short). Short sales against the box could be used to protect the net asset value per share
(NAV) of the fund in anticipation of increased interest rates, without sacrificing the current yield of the securities sold short.
If a fund enters into a short sale against the box, it will be required to set aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the
securities sold short (or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities) and will be required to hold such
securities while the short sale is outstanding. The fund will incur transaction costs in connection with opening and closing
short sales against the box.

Sources of Liquidity or Credit Support. Issuers may employ various forms of credit and liquidity enhancements,
including letters of credit, guarantees, puts, and demand features, and insurance provided by domestic or foreign entities such
as banks and other financial institutions. FMR may rely on its evaluation of the credit of the liquidity or credit enhancement
provider in determining whether to purchase a security supported by such enhancement. In evaluating the credit of a foreign
bank or other foreign entities, FMR will consider whether adequate public information about the entity is available and
whether the entity may be subject to unfavorable political or economic developments, currency controls, or other government
restrictions that might affect its ability to honor its commitment. Changes in the credit quality of the entity providing the
enhancement could affect the value of the security or a fund's share price.

Stripped Securities are the separate income or principal components of a debt security. The risks associated with
stripped securities are similar to those of other money market securities, although stripped securities may be more volatile.
U.S. Treasury securities that have been stripped by a Federal Reserve Bank are obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury.

Privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer deposits a U.S. Treasury security or other U.S.
Government security with a custodian for safekeeping. The custodian issues separate receipts for the coupon payments and
the principal payment, which the dealer then sells.

Because the SEC does not consider privately stripped government securities to be U.S. Government securities for
purposes of Rule 2a-7, a fund must evaluate them as it would non-government securities pursuant to regulatory guidelines
applicable to money market funds.

Variable and Floating Rate Securities provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the security.
Variable rate securities provide for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate, while floating rate securities have
interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a designated benchmark rate or the issuer's credit quality. Some
variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid
principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries.

When-Issued and Forward Purchase or Sale Transactions involve a commitment to purchase or sell specific
securities at a predetermined price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement period
for that type of security. Typically, no interest accrues to the purchaser until the security is delivered.

When purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions, the purchaser assumes the rights and risks of
ownership, including the risks of price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security will not be issued as anticipated.
Because payment for the securities is not required until the delivery date, these risks are in addition to the risks associated
with a fund's investments. If a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a purchase is outstanding, the
purchases may result in a form of leverage. When a fund has sold a security pursuant to one of these transactions, the fund
does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security. If the other party to a delayed-delivery transaction
fails to deliver or pay for the securities, a fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or suffer a loss.

A fund may renegotiate a when-issued or forward transaction and may sell the underlying securities before delivery,
which may result in capital gains or losses for the fund.

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of each fund by FMR pursuant to authority
contained in the management contract. FMR may also be responsible for the placement of portfolio transactions for other
investment companies and investment accounts for which it has or its affiliates have investment discretion. In selecting
brokers or dealers (including affiliates of FMR), FMR generally considers: the execution price; the size and type of the
transaction; the nature and character of the markets for the security to be purchased or sold; the execution efficiency,
settlement capability, and financial condition of the firm; the execution services rendered on a continuing basis; the
reasonableness of any commissions; and the provision of additional brokerage and research products and services.

If FMR grants investment management authority to a sub-adviser (see the section entitled "Management Contracts"),
that sub-adviser is authorized to provide the services described in the sub-advisory agreement, and will do so in accordance
with the policies described in this section.

Purchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are effected through brokers who charge a commission for
their services.

Securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees.

Ordinarily commissions are not charged on over-the-counter (OTC) orders because a fund pays a spread which is
included in the cost of the security, and is the difference between the dealer's cost and the cost to the fund. When a fund
executes an OTC order with an electronic communications network, an alternative trading system, or a non-market maker, a
commission is charged because there is no spread on the trade.

Each fund may execute portfolio transactions with brokers or dealers that provide products and services. These products
and services may include: economic, industry, or company research reports or investment recommendations; subscriptions
to financial publications or research data compilations; compilations of securities prices, earnings, dividends, and similar
data; computerized databases; quotation equipment and services; research or analytical computer software and services;
products or services that assist in effecting transactions, including services of third-party computer systems developers
directly related to research and brokerage activities; and effecting securities transactions and performing functions
incidental thereto (such as clearance and settlement). The receipt of these products and services has not reduced FMR's
normal research activities in providing investment advice to the funds. FMR's expenses could be increased, however, if it
attempted to generate these additional products and services through its own efforts.

Certain of the products and services FMR receives from brokers or dealers are furnished by brokers or dealers on their own
initiative, either in connection with a particular transaction or as part of their overall services. In addition, FMR may request a
broker or dealer to provide a specific proprietary or third-party product or service. While FMR takes into account the products
and services provided by a broker or dealer in determining whether commissions are reasonable, neither FMR nor a fund
incurs an obligation to the broker, dealer, or third party to pay for any product or service (or portion thereof) by generating a
certain amount of commissions or otherwise.

Brokers or dealers that execute transactions for a<R> fund may receive commissions</R> that are in excess of the
amount of commissions that other brokers or dealers might have charged, in recognition of the products and services they
have provided. Before causing a fund to pay such higher commissions, FMR will make a good faith determination that the
commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the products and services provided viewed in terms of the particular
transaction for the fund or FMR's overall responsibilities to the fund or other investment companies and investment
accounts. Typically, these products and services assist FMR or its affiliates in terms of its overall investment responsibilities
to the fund and other investment companies and investment accounts; however, each product or service received may not
benefit the fund.

FMR is authorized to allocate portfolio transactions in a manner that takes into account assistance received in the
distribution of shares of the funds or other Fidelity funds and to use the research services of brokerage and other firms that
have provided such assistance. FMR may place trades with certain brokers with which it is under common control,
including National Financial Services LLC (NFS) and Fidelity Brokerage Services (Japan) LLC (FBSJ), provided it
determines that these affiliates' products, services, and costs are comparable to those of non-affiliated, qualified brokerage
firms. FMR may also place trades with REDIBook ECN LLC (REDIBook)<R> and Archipelago ECN (Archipelago),
electronic communication networks (ECNs)</R> in which a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR Corp. has an equity
ownership interest, if the commissions are fair, reasonable, and comparable to commissions charged by non-affiliated,
qualified brokerage firms for similar services.

FMR may allocate brokerage transactions to brokers or dealers (including affiliates of FMR) who have entered into
arrangements with FMR under which the broker-dealer allocates a portion of the commissions paid by a fund toward the
reduction of that fund's expenses. The transaction quality must, however, be comparable to that of other qualified
broker-dealers.

The Trustees of each fund periodically review FMR's performance of its responsibilities in connection with the
placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by the fund over representative
periods of time to determine if they are reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund.

A fund may pay both commissions and spreads in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions. For the fiscal
years ended April 30, 2002, 2001, and, 2000, each fund paid no brokerage commissions.

For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002, each fund paid no brokerage commissions to firms for providing research
services.

The Trustees of each fund have approved procedures in conformity with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act whereby a fund
may purchase securities that are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of FMR participates. These procedures
prohibit the funds from directly or indirectly benefiting an FMR affiliate in connection with such underwritings. In addition,
for underwritings where an FMR affiliate participates as a principal underwriter, certain restrictions may apply that could,
among other things, limit the amount of securities that the funds could purchase in the underwritings.

From time to time the Trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the funds of some portion of the
brokerage commissions or similar fees paid by the funds on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable. Each
fund seeks to recapture soliciting broker-dealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities, but at present no other recapture
arrangements are in effect. The Trustees intend to continue to review whether recapture opportunities are available and are
legally permissible and, if so, to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be advisable for each
fund to seek such recapture.

Although the Trustees and officers of each fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by FMR or its
affiliates, investment decisions for each fund are made independently from those of other funds or investment accounts
<R>(including proprietary accounts)</R> managed by FMR or its affiliates. The same security is often held in the portfolio
of more than one of these funds or investment accounts. Simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and
investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser, particularly when the same security is suitable for the
investment objective of more than one fund or investment account.

When two or more funds <R>or investment accounts</R> are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the
same security, the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable
<R>to</R> each fund. In some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as
each fund is concerned. In other cases, however, the ability of the funds to participate in volume transactions will produce
better executions and prices for the funds. It is the current opinion of the Trustees that the desirability of retaining FMR as
investment adviser to each fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous
transactions.

VALUATION

Each fund's NAV is the value of a single share. The NAV of each fund is computed by adding the value of the fund's
investments, cash, and other assets, subtracting its liabilities, and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding.

Portfolio securities and other assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost. This technique involves initially valuing
an instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its current market
value. The amortized cost value of an instrument may be higher or lower than the price a fund would receive if it sold the
instrument.

Securities of other open-end investment companies are valued at their respective NAVs.

At such intervals as they deem appropriate, the Trustees consider the extent to which NAV calculated by using market
valuations would deviate from the $1.00 per share calculated using amortized cost valuation. If the Trustees believe that a
deviation from a fund's amortized cost per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders, the
Trustees have agreed to take such corrective action, if any, as they deem appropriate to eliminate or reduce, to the extent
reasonably practicable, the dilution or unfair results. Such corrective action could include selling portfolio instruments prior
to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity; withholding dividends; redeeming
shares in kind; establishing NAV by using available market quotations; and such other measures as the Trustees may deem
appropriate.

PERFORMANCE

A fund may quote performance in various ways. All performance information supplied by the funds in advertising is
historical and is not intended to indicate future returns. Each fund's yield and return fluctuate in response to market
conditions and other factors.

Yield Calculations. To compute the yield for a fund for a period, the net change in value of a hypothetical investment in
one share reflects the value of additional shares purchased with dividends from the one original share and dividends
declared on both the original share and any additional shares. The net change is then divided by the value of the investment
at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return. This base period return is annualized to obtain a current
annualized yield. A fund also may calculate an effective yield by compounding the base period return over a one-year
period. In addition to the current yield, a fund may quote yields in advertising based on any historical seven-day period.
Yields for a fund are calculated on the same basis as other money market funds, as required by applicable regulation.

Yield information may be useful in reviewing a fund's performance and in providing a basis for comparison with other
investment alternatives. However, a fund's yield fluctuates, unlike investments that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated
period of time. When comparing investment alternatives, investors should also note the quality and maturity of the portfolio
securities of respective investment companies they have chosen to consider.

Investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates a fund's yield will tend to be somewhat higher than
prevailing market rates, and in periods of rising interest rates a fund's yield will tend to be somewhat lower. Also, when
interest rates are falling, the inflow of net new money to a fund from the continuous sale of its shares will likely be invested
in instruments producing lower yields than the balance of the fund's holdings, thereby reducing a fund's current yield. In
periods of rising interest rates, the opposite can be expected to occur.

Return Calculations. Returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of a fund's return, including the effect of
reinvesting dividends and capital gain distributions, and any change in a fund's NAV over a stated period. A cumulative
return reflects actual performance over a stated period of time. Average annual returns are calculated by determining the
growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in a fund over a stated period, and then calculating the
annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had
been constant over the period. For example, a cumulative return of 100% over ten years would produce an average annual
return of 7.18%, which is the steady annual rate of return that would equal 100% growth on a compounded basis in ten years.
While average annual returns are a convenient means of comparing investment alternatives, investors should realize that a
fund's performance is not constant over time, but changes from year to year, and that average annual returns represent
averaged figures as opposed to the actual year-to-year performance of a fund.

<R>In addition to average annual returns, a fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative returns reflecting the simple
change in value of an investment over a stated period. Average annual and cumulative returns may be quoted as a percentage
or as a dollar amount, and may be calculated for a single investment, a series of investments, or a series of redemptions, over
any time period. Returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital (including capital gains and
changes in share price) to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to return. Returns may or may not
include the effect of a fund's small balance maintenance fee or the effect of a fund's closeout fee. Excluding a fund's small
balance maintenance fee or fund closeout fee from a return calculation produces a higher return figure. Returns, yields and
other performance information may be quoted numerically or in a table, graph, or similar illustration.</R>

The returns in the preceding table do not include the effect of the $5 fund closeout fee for each fund.

Note: If FMR had not reimbursed certain fund expenses during these periods, each fund's returns would have been
lower.

<R>The following tables show the change in value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in each fund during the 10-year
period ended April 30, 2002, assuming all distributions were reinvested. Returns are based on past results and are not an
indication of future performance. Tax consequences of different investments have not been factored into the figures below.
The tables also show the income and capital elements of a fund's cumulative return.</R> The tables compare a fund's return
to the record of the Standard & Poor's 500SM  Index (S&P 500®), the Dow Jones IndustrialSM  Average (DJIASM ), and the cost
of living, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), over the same period. The S&P 500 and DJIA comparisons are
provided to show how a fund's return compared to the record of a market capitalization-weighted index of common stocks
and a narrower set of stocks of major industrial companies, respectively, over the same period. Because each fund invests in
short-term debt securities, common stocks represent a different type of investment from the funds. Common stocks
generally offer greater growth potential than the funds, but generally experience greater price volatility, which means
greater potential for loss. In addition, common stocks generally provide lower income than investments such as the funds.
The S&P 500 and DJIA returns are based on the prices of unmanaged groups of stocks and, unlike a fund's returns, do not
include the effect of brokerage commissions or other costs of investing.

Performance Comparisons. A fund's performance may be compared to the performance of other mutual funds in
general, or to the performance of particular types of mutual funds. These comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund
rankings prepared by Lipper Inc. (Lipper), an independent service located in Summit, New Jersey that monitors the
performance of mutual funds. Generally, Lipper rankings are based on return, assume reinvestment of distributions, do not
take sales charges or trading fees into consideration, and are prepared without regard to tax consequences. Lipper may also
rank based on yield. In addition to the mutual fund rankings, a fund's performance may be compared to stock, bond, and
money market mutual fund performance indexes prepared by Lipper or other organizations. When comparing these
indexes, it is important to remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment. For example, while stock
mutual funds may offer higher potential returns, they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility. Likewise, money
market funds may offer greater stability of principal, but generally do not offer the higher potential returns available from
stock mutual funds.

From time to time, a fund's performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business
publications and periodicals. For example, a fund may quote Morningstar, Inc. in its advertising materials. Morningstar, Inc.
is a mutual fund rating service that rates mutual funds on the basis of risk-adjusted performance. Rankings that compare the
performance of Fidelity funds to one another in appropriate categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in
advertising.

A fund may be compared in advertising to Certificates of Deposit (CDs) or other investments issued by banks or other
depository institutions. Mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects. For example, a fund may offer
greater liquidity or higher potential returns than CDs, a fund does not guarantee an investor's principal or return, and fund
shares are not FDIC insured.

Fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals understand their investment goals and explore various
financial strategies. Such information may include information about current economic, market, and political conditions;
materials that describe general principles of investing, such as asset allocation, diversification, risk tolerance, and goal
setting; questionnaires designed to help create a personal financial profile; worksheets used to project savings needs based
on assumed rates of inflation and hypothetical rates of return; and action plans offering investment alternatives. Materials
may also include discussions of Fidelity's asset allocation funds and other Fidelity funds, products, and services.

Ibbotson Associates of Chicago, Illinois (Ibbotson) provides historical returns of the capital markets in the United
States, including common stocks, small capitalization stocks, long-term corporate bonds, intermediate-term government
bonds, long-term government bonds, Treasury bills, the U.S. rate of inflation (based on the CPI), and combinations of
various capital markets. The performance of these capital markets is based on the returns of different indexes.

Fidelity funds may use the performance of these capital markets in order to demonstrate general risk-versus-reward
investment scenarios. Performance comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical investment in any of these
capital markets. The risks associated with the security types in any capital market may or may not correspond directly to
those of the funds. Ibbotson calculates returns in the same method as the funds. The funds may also compare performance to
that of other compilations or indexes that may be developed and made available in the future.

A money market fund may compare its performance or the performance of securities in which it may invest to averages
published by iMoneyNet, Inc. of Westborough, Massachusetts. These averages assume reinvestment of distributions.
iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND REPORT AVERAGES/U.S. Treasury, which is reported in iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND
REPORT, covers <R>30</R> U.S. Treasury money market funds. iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND REPORT
AVERAGES/Government, which is reported in iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND REPORT, covers <R>228</R>
government money market funds. iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND REPORT AVERAGES/All-Taxable, which is reported in
iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND REPORT, covers <R>1,153</R> taxable money market funds.

In advertising materials, Fidelity may reference or discuss its products and services, which may include other Fidelity
funds; retirement investing; brokerage products and services; model portfolios or allocations; saving for college or other
goals; and charitable giving. In addition, Fidelity may quote or reprint financial or business publications and periodicals as
they relate to current economic and political conditions, fund management, portfolio composition, investment philosophy,
investment techniques, the desirability of owning a particular mutual fund, and Fidelity services and products. Fidelity may
also reprint, and use as advertising and sales literature, articles from Fidelity Focus®, a quarterly magazine provided free of
charge to Fidelity fund shareholders.

A fund may present its fund number, Quotron® number, and CUSIP number, and discuss or quote its current portfolio
manager.

As of <R>April 30, 2002</R>, FMR advised over $<R>47</R> billion in municipal fund assets, $<R>189</R> billion
in taxable fixed-income fund assets, $<R>191 </R>billion in money market fund assets, $<R>488</R> billion in equity
fund assets, and $<R>20</R> billion in international fund assets. The funds may reference the growth and variety of money
market mutual funds and the adviser's innovation and participation in the industry. The equity funds under management
figure represents the largest amount of equity fund assets under management by a mutual fund investment adviser in the
United States, making FMR America's leading equity (stock) fund manager. FMR, its subsidiaries, and affiliates maintain a
worldwide information and communications network for the purpose of researching and managing investments abroad.

In addition to performance rankings, a fund may compare its total expense ratio to the average total expense ratio of
similar funds tracked by Lipper. A fund's total expense ratio is a significant factor in comparing debt and money market
investments because of its effect on yield.

BUYING, SELLING, AND EXCHANGING INFORMATION

A fund may make redemption payments in whole or in part in readily marketable securities or other property pursuant to
procedures approved by the Trustees if FMR determines it is in the best interests of the fund. Such securities or other
property will be valued for this purpose as they are valued in computing each fund's NAV. Shareholders that receive
securities or other property will realize, upon receipt, a gain or loss for tax purposes, and will incur additional costs and be
exposed to market risk prior to and upon sale of such securities or other property.

DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES

Dividends. Because each fund's income is primarily derived from interest, dividends from the fund generally will not
qualify for the dividends-received deduction available to corporate shareholders. Short-term capital gains are taxable as
dividends, but do not qualify for the dividends-received deduction.

Capital Gain Distributions. Each fund may distribute any net realized capital gains once a year or more often, as
necessary.

As of April 30, 2002, Spartan Money Market had an aggregate capital loss carryforward of approximately
$<R>459,000</R>. This loss carryforward, of which $<R>295,000</R>, $<R>162,000</R>, and $<R>2,000 </R>will
expire on April 30, <R>2003</R>, <R>2004</R>, and <R>2008</R>, respectively, is available to offset future capital
gains.

State and Local Tax Issues. For mutual funds organized as business trusts, state law provides for a pass-through of the
state and local income tax exemption afforded to direct owners of U.S. Government securities. Some states limit this
pass-through to mutual funds that invest a certain amount in U.S. Government securities, and some types of securities, such
as repurchase agreements and some agency-backed securities, may not qualify for this benefit. The tax treatment of your
dividends from a fund will be the same as if you directly owned a proportionate share of the U.S. Government securities.
Because the income earned on certain U.S. Government securities is exempt from state and local personal income taxes, the
portion of dividends from a fund attributable to these securities will also be free from state and local personal income taxes.
The exemption from state and local personal income taxation does not preclude states from assessing other taxes on the
ownership of U.S. Government securities.

Tax Status of the Funds. Each fund intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code so that it will not be liable for federal tax on income and capital gains distributed
to shareholders. In order to qualify as a regulated investment company, and avoid being subject to federal income or excise
taxes at the fund level, each fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net realized capital
gains within each calendar year as well as on a fiscal year basis, and intends to comply with other tax rules applicable to
regulated investment companies.

Other Tax Information. The information above is only a summary of some of the tax consequences generally affecting
each fund and its shareholders, and no attempt has been made to discuss individual tax consequences. It is up to you or your
tax preparer to determine whether the sale of shares of a fund resulted in a capital gain or loss or other tax consequence to
you. In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to state and local taxes on fund distributions, and
shares may be subject to state and local personal property taxes. Investors should consult their tax advisers to determine
whether a fund is suitable to their particular tax situation.

<R>TRUSTEES AND OFFICERS</R>

<R>The Trustees </R>and executive officers of the trust and funds, as applicable, are listed below. The Board of
Trustees governs each fund and is responsible for protecting the interests of shareholders. The Trustees are experienced
executives who meet periodically throughout the year to oversee each fund's activities, review contractual arrangements
with companies that provide services to each fund, and review each fund's performance. Except for William O. McCoy and
William S. Stavropoulos, each of the Trustees oversees 261 funds advised by FMR or an affiliate. Mr. McCoy oversees 263
funds advised by FMR or an affiliate, and Mr. Stavropoulos oversees 201 funds advised by FMR or an affiliate.

The Trustees hold office without limit in time except that (a) any Trustee may resign; (b) any Trustee may be removed by
written instrument, signed by at least two-thirds of the number of Trustees prior to such removal; (c) any Trustee who
requests to be retired or who has become incapacitated by illness or injury may be retired by written instrument signed by a
majority of the other Trustees; and (d) any Trustee may be removed at any special meeting of shareholders by a two-thirds
vote of the outstanding voting securities of the trust. The executive officers hold office without limit in time, except that any
officer may resign or may be removed by a vote of a majority of the Trustees at any regular meeting or any special meeting
of the Trustees. Except as indicated, each individual has held the office shown or other offices in the same company for the
past five years.

<R></R>Standing Committees of the Funds' Trustees. The Board of Trustees has established various committees
to facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of all matters of importance to non-interested Trustees, each fund, and
fund shareholders and to facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, the Board of Trustees has
10 standing committees.

<R>The Committee on Operations is composed of all of the non-interested Trustees, with Mr. Mann currently serving as
Chairman. The committee normally meets monthly and serves as a forum for consideration of issues of importance to the
non-interested Trustees. The committee also considers matters involving potential conflicts of interest between the funds
and FMR and its affiliates and reviews proposed contracts and the continuation of contracts between the Fidelity funds and
FMR and its affiliates, and annually reviews and makes recommendations regarding transfer agent agreements, insurance
coverage, and custody agreements. The committee also monitors additional issues including the level of service provided to
shareholders, significant litigation, and the voting of proxies of portfolio companies. During the fiscal year ended April 30,
2002, the committee held 11 meetings.</R>

<R>The Fair Value Oversight Committee is composed of all of the non-interested Trustees, with Mr. Mann serving as
Chairman. The committee normally meets four times a year, or more often as required, in conjunction with meetings of the
Board of Trustees. The Fair Value Oversight Committee monitors and establishes policies concerning procedures and
controls regarding the valuation of fund investments and their classification as liquid or illiquid. The committee provides
oversight regarding the investment policies and Fidelity funds' investment in non-traditional securities. The committee also
reviews actions taken by FMR's Fair Value Committee. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002, the committee held
four meetings.</R>

<R>The Board of Trustees has established three fund oversight committees: the Equity Committee (composed of
Messrs. McCoy (Chairman), Cox, Lautenbach, and Lynch), the Fixed-Income/International Committee (composed of
Messrs. Gates (Chairman) and Kirk and Ms. Knowles), and the Select Committee (composed of Ms. Davis (Chairman) and
Messrs. Cook and Stavropoulos). Each committee's members confer periodically and normally meet monthly. Each
committee oversees investment advisory services provided by FMR to the relevant funds and monitors the investment
objectives, policies, and practices of the relevant Fidelity funds. Each committee also monitors compliance by each relevant
Fidelity fund with its investment policies, appropriate benchmarks, competitive universes, and investment performance.
The Fixed-Income/International Committee also receives reports required under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act. During the
fiscal year ended April 30, 2002, the Equity Committee held 10 meetings, the Fixed-Income/International Committee held
11 meetings, and the Select Committee held 10 meetings.</R>

<R>The Committee on Service Fees is composed of Messrs. McCoy (Chairman), Cook, Kirk, and Lautenbach. The
committee members confer periodically and meet at least annually. The committee considers the structure of the Fidelity
funds' transfer agency fees, direct fees to investors, and the specific services rendered by FMR and its affiliates in
consideration of these fees. The committee also considers fee structures for other non-investment management services
rendered to the Fidelity funds by FMR and its affiliates. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002, the committee held two
meetings.</R>

<R>The Brokerage Committee is composed of Messrs. Cox (Chairman), Cook, McCoy, and Stavropoulos and Ms.
Davis. The committee normally meets four times a year, or more often as required, in conjunction with meetings of the
Board of Trustees. The committee monitors and recommends policies concerning the securities transactions of the Fidelity
funds. The committee periodically reviews the policies and practices with respect to efforts to achieve best execution and
commissions paid to firms supplying research and brokerage services, providing sales support, or paying fund expenses.
The committee also monitors brokerage and other relationships between the Fidelity funds and firms affiliated with FMR
which participate in the execution of securities transactions. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002, the committee held
five meetings.</R>

<R>The Committee on Distribution Channels is composed of Messrs. Cox (Chairman), Gates, and Stavropoulos and
Mses. Davis and Knowles. The committee members confer periodically and hold meetings at least annually. The committee
considers issues bearing on the various distribution channels employed by the Fidelity funds, including issues regarding Rule
18f-3 plans and related consideration of classes of shares, sales load structures, load waivers, selling concessions and service
charges paid to intermediaries, Rule 12b-1 plans, contingent deferred sales charges, and finders' fees. During the fiscal year
ended April 30, 2002, the committee held four meetings.</R>

<R>The Audit Committee is composed of Messrs. Kirk (Chairman), Gates, and Lautenbach, and Ms. Knowles. The
committee normally meets four times a year, or more often as required, in conjunction with meetings of the Board of
Trustees. The committee oversees and monitors each Fidelity fund's internal accounting and control structure, its auditing
function and its financial reporting process, including the resolution of material reporting issues. The committee
recommends to the full Board of Trustees the appointment of auditors for the Fidelity funds. It reviews audit plans, fees and
other material arrangements in respect of the engagement of auditors, including non-audit services to be performed. It
reviews the qualifications of key personnel involved in the foregoing activities and monitors auditor independence. The
committee plays an oversight role in respect of each Fidelity fund's investment compliance procedures and the code of
ethics. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002, the committee held four meetings.</R>

<R>The Nominating and Administration Committee is composed of Messrs. Mann (Chairman), Cox, and Gates. The
committee members confer periodically and hold meetings as required. The committee makes nominations for
non-interested Trustees, for Members of the Advisory Board, and for membership on committees. The committee
periodically reviews procedures and policies of the Board of Trustees and its committees and periodically reviews
compensation of non-interested Trustees. It acts as the administrative committee under the Retirement Plan for
non-interested Trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996 and under the fee deferral plan for non-interested Trustees.
It monitors the performance of legal counsel employed by the Fidelity funds and the non-interested Trustees. On behalf of
the non-interested Trustees, the committee will make such findings and determinations as to the independence of counsel
for the non-interested Trustees as may be appropriate under applicable regulations or otherwise. The committee monitors
compliance with, and acts as the administrator of, the provisions of the code of ethics and any supplemental policies
regarding personal securities transactions applicable to the non-interested Trustees. The Nominating and Administration
Committee will consider nominees to the Board of Trustees recommended by shareholders. Recommendations should be
submitted to the committee in care of the Secretary of the Fidelity funds. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002, the
committee held one meeting.</R>

*  Inte<R>rested persons are compensated by </R>FMR.

**  Durin<R>g the period from November 1, 2000 through May 14, 2002, Mr. Stavropoulos served as a Member of the
Advisory Board. Effective May 15, 2002, Mr. Stavropoul</R>os serves as a Member of the Board of Trustees.

A  Information is for the calendar year ended December 31, 2001 for 264 funds<R> of 56 trusts</R> in the complex.
Compensation figures include cash, amounts required to be deferred, and may include amounts deferred at the
election of Trustees. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2001, the Trustees accrued required deferred
compensation from the funds as follows: J. Michael Cook, $111,000; Ralph F. Cox, $111,000; Phyllis Burke Davis,
$111,000; Robert M. Gates, $111,000; Donald J. Kirk, $111,000; Marie L. Knowles, $111,000; Ned C. Lautenbach,
$111,000; Marvin L. Mann, $141,000; William O. McCoy, $111,000; and William S. Stavropoulos, $26,734. Certain
of the non-interested Trustees elected voluntarily to defer a portion of their compensation as follows: J. Michael
Cook, $30,723; Ralph F. Cox, $30,723; Ned C. Lautenbach, $38,103; and William O. McCoy, $38,103.

<R>B  Compensation figures include cash, amounts required to be deferred, and may include amounts deferred at the
election of Trustees. The amounts required to be deferred by each non-interested Trustee are as follows: J. Michael
Cook, $1,846; Ralph F. Cox, $1,846; Phyllis Burke Davis, $1,846; Robert M. Gates, $1,846; Donald J. Kirk, $1,846;
Marie L. Knowles, $1,846; Ned C. Lautenbach, $1,846; Marvin L. Mann, $2,345; and William O. McCoy, $1,846.
Certain of the non-interested Trustees' aggregate compensation from the fund includes accrued voluntary deferred
compensation as follows: Phyllis Burke Davis, $258; Ned C. Lautenbach, $699; and William O. McCoy, $699.</R>

Under a deferred compensation plan adopted in September 1995 and amended in November 1996 and January 2000 (the
Plan), non-interested Trustees must defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an additional portion of,
their annual fees. Amounts deferred under the Plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in
shares of a cross-section of Fidelity funds including funds in each major investment discipline and representing a majority
of Fidelity's assets under management (the Reference Funds). The amounts ultimately received by the non-interested
Trustees under the Plan will be directly linked to the investment performance of the Reference Funds. Deferral of fees in
accordance with the Plan will have a negligible effect on a fund's assets, liabilities, and net income per share, and will not
obligate a fund to retain the services of any non-interested Trustee or to pay any particular level of compensation to the
non-interested Trustee. A fund may invest in the Reference Funds under the Plan without shareholder approval.

As of April 30, 2002, the Trustees and officers of each fund owned, in the aggregate, less than <R>1</R>% of each
fund's total outstanding shares.

CONTROL OF INVESTMENT ADVISERS

FMR Corp., organized in 1972, is the ultimate parent company of FMR and Fidelity Investments Money Management,
Inc. (FIMM). The voting common stock of FMR Corp. is divided into two classes. Class B is held predominantly by
members of the Edward C. Johnson 3d family and is entitled to 49% of the vote on any matter acted upon by the voting
common stock. Class A is held predominantly by non-Johnson family member employees of FMR Corp. and its affiliates
and is entitled to 51% of the vote on any such matter. The Johnson family group and all other Class B shareholders have
entered into a shareholders' voting agreement under which all Class B shares will be voted in accordance with the majority
vote of Class B shares. Under the 1940 Act, control of a company is presumed where one individual or group of individuals
owns more than 25% of the voting stock of that company. Therefore, through their ownership of voting common stock and
the execution of the shareholders' voting agreement, members of the Johnson family may be deemed, under the 1940 Act, to
form a controlling group with respect to FMR Corp.

At present, the primary business activities of FMR Corp. and its subsidiaries are: (i) the provision of investment
advisory, management, shareholder, investment information and assistance and certain fiduciary services for individual and
institutional investors; (ii) the provision of securities brokerage services; (iii) the management and development of real
estate; and (iv) the investment in and operation of a number of emerging businesses.

FMR, FIMM (the Investment Advisers), Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), and the funds have adopted a code of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act that sets forth employees' fiduciary responsibilities regarding the funds, establishes
procedures for personal investing, and restricts certain transactions. Employees subject to the code of ethics, including
Fidelity investment personnel, may invest in securities for their own investment accounts, including securities that may be
purchased or held by the funds.

MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

Each fund has entered into a management contract with FMR, pursuant to which FMR furnishes investment advisory
and other services.

Management Services. Under the terms of its management contract with each fund, FMR acts as investment adviser
and, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, directs the investments of the fund in accordance with its investment
objective, policies and limitations. FMR also provides each fund with all necessary office facilities and personnel for
servicing the fund's investments, compensates all officers of each fund and all Trustees who are "interested persons" of the
trust or of FMR, and all personnel of each fund or FMR performing services relating to research, statistical and investment
activities.

In addition, FMR or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, provide the management and
administrative services necessary for the operation of each fund. These services include providing facilities for maintaining
each fund's organization; supervising relations with custodians, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, underwriters and
other persons dealing with each fund; preparing all general shareholder communications and conducting shareholder
relations; maintaining each fund's records and the registration of each fund's shares under federal securities laws and making
necessary filings under state securities laws; developing management and shareholder services for each fund; and furnishing
reports, evaluations and analyses on a variety of subjects to the Trustees.

Management-Related Expenses. Under the terms of each fund's management contract, FMR is responsible for
payment of all operating expenses of each fund with certain exceptions. Specific expenses payable by FMR include
expenses for typesetting, printing, and mailing proxy materials to shareholders, legal expenses, fees of the custodian,
auditor, and interested Trustees, each fund's proportionate share of insurance premiums and Investment Company Institute
dues, and the costs of registering shares under federal securities laws and making necessary filings under state securities
laws. Each fund's management contract further provides that FMR will pay for typesetting, printing, and mailing
prospectuses, statements of additional information, notices, and reports to shareholders; however, <R>under the terms of
each fund's transfer agent agreement, the transfer agent bears these costs</R>. FMR also pays all fees associated with
transfer agent, dividend disbursing, and shareholder services and pricing and bookkeeping services.

FMR pays all other expenses of each fund with the following exceptions: fees and expenses of the non-interested
Trustees, interest, taxes, brokerage commissions (if any), money market insurance premiums (beginning January 1, 2004),
i<R>f any, for Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market, Spartan U.S. Government Money Market, and Spartan Money
Market, </R>and such non-recurring expenses as may arise, including costs of any litigation to which a fund may be a party,
and any obligation it may have to indemnify its officers and Trustees with respect to litigation.

Management Fees. For the services of FMR under each management contract, each fund pays FMR a monthly
management fee at the annual rate of<R> 0.42%</R> of the fund's average net assets throughout the month.

The management fee paid to FMR by each fund is reduced by an amount equal to the fees and expenses paid by the fund
to the non-interested Trustees.

The following table shows the amount of management fees paid by each fund to FMR for the past three fiscal years, and
the amount of credits reducing management fees for each fund.

<R>(dagger)  On July 1, 2001, FMR reduced the management fee rate paid by the funds from 0.45% to 0.42%.</R>

FMR may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a portion of a fund's operating expenses (exclusive of interest,
taxes, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses), which is subject to revision or discontinuance. FMR retains the
ability to be repaid for these expense reimbursements in the amount that expenses fall below the limit prior to the end of the
fiscal year.

Expense reimbursements by FMR will increase a fund's returns and yield, and repayment of the reimbursement by a
fund will lower its returns and yield.

Sub-Adviser - FIMM. On behalf of each fund, FMR has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with FIMM pursuant
to which FIMM has primary responsibility for choosing investments for each fund.

Under the terms of the sub-advisory agreements, FMR pays FIMM fees equal to 50% of the management fee payable to
FMR under its management contract with each fund. The fees paid to FIMM are not reduced by any voluntary or mandatory
expense reimbursements that may be in effect from time to time.

Fees paid to FIMM by FMR on behalf of <R>each fund</R> for the past three fiscal years are shown in the table below.

<R>BOARD APPROVAL OF THE EXISTING INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACTS</R>

<R></R>Matters Considered by the Board. The mutual funds for which the members of the Board of Trustees serve
as Trustees are referred to herein as the "Fidelity funds." The Board of Trustees is scheduled to meet 11 times a year. The
Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, believes that matters bearing on each fund's advisory contracts are
considered at most, if not all, of its meetings. While the full Board of Trustees or the non-interested Trustees, as appropriate,
act on all major matters, a significant portion of the activities of the Board of Trustees (including certain of those described
herein) is conducted through committees. The non-interested Trustees meet frequently in executive session and are advised
by independent legal counsel selected by the non-interested Trustees.

<R></R>Information Received by the Board of Trustees. In connection with their meetings, the Board of Trustees,
including the non-interested Trustees, received materials specifically relating to the existing management contracts and
subadvisory agreements (the Investment Advisory Contracts). These materials included (i) information on the investment
performance of each fund, a peer group of funds and an appropriate index or combination of indices, (ii) sales and redemption
data in respect of each fund, and (iii) the economic outlook and the general investment outlook in the markets in which each
fund invests. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, also considers periodically other material facts such
as (1) the Investment Advisers' results and financial condition, (2) arrangements in respect of the distribution of each fund's
shares, (3) the procedures employed to determine the value of each fund's assets, (4) the allocation of each fund's brokerage, if
any, including allocations to brokers affiliated with the Investment Advisers, the use of "soft" commission dollars to pay fund
expenses and to pay for research and other similar services, and the allocation of brokerage to firms that sell Fidelity fund
shares, (5) the Investment Advisers' management of the relationships with each fund's custodian and subcustodians, (6) the
resources devoted to and the record of compliance with each fund's investment policies and restrictions and with policies on
personal securities transactions, and (7) the nature, cost and character of non-investment management services provided by the
Investment Advisers and their affiliates.

<R>Additional information was furnished by the Investment Advisers including, among other items, information on
and analysis of (a) the overall organization of the Investment Advisers, (b) investment performance, (c) the choice of
performance indices and benchmarks, (d) the composition of peer groups of funds, (e) transfer agency and bookkeeping
fees paid to affiliates of the Investment Advisers, (f) investment management staffing, (g) the potential for achieving further
economies of scale, (h) operating expenses paid to third parties, and (i) the information furnished to investors, including
each fund's shareholders.</R>

<R>In considering the Investment Advisory Contracts, the Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, did
not identify any single factor as all-important or controlling, and the following summary does not detail all the matters
considered. Matters considered by the Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, in connection with its
approval of the Investment Advisory Contracts include the following:</R>

<R></R>Benefits to Shareholders. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, considered the
benefit to shareholders of investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment
disciplines and providing for a large variety of fund and shareholder services.

<R></R>Investment Compliance and Performance. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested
Trustees, considered whether each fund has operated within its investment objective and its record of compliance with its
investment restrictions. It also reviewed each fund's investment performance as well as the performance of a peer group
of mutual funds, and the performance of an appropriate index or combination of indices.

<R>The Investment Advisers' Personnel and Methods. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested
Trustees, reviews at least annually the background of each fund's portfolio manager and each fund's investment objective
and discipline. The non-interested Trustees have also had discussions with senior management of the Investment
Advisers responsible for investment</R> operations and the senior management of Fidelity's money market group.
Among other things they considered the size, education and experience of the Investment Advisers' investment staff, their
use of technology, and the Investment Advisers' approach to recruiting, training and retaining portfolio managers and
other research, advisory and management personnel.

<R></R>Nature and Quality of Other Services. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees,
considered the nature, quality, cost and extent of administrative and shareholder services performed by the Investment
Advisers and affiliated companies, under the existing Investment Advisory Contracts and under separate agreements
covering transfer agency functions and pricing, bookkeeping and securities lending services, if any. The Board of
Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, has also considered the nature and extent of the Investment Advisers'
supervision of third party service providers, principally custodians and subcustodians.

<R></R>Expenses. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, considered each fund's expense
ratio, and expense ratios of a peer group of funds. It also considered the amount and nature of fees paid by shareholders.

<R></R>Profitability. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, considered the level of the
Investment Advisers' profits in respect of the management of the Fidelity funds, including each fund. This consideration
included an extensive review of the Investment Advisers' methodology in allocating their costs to the management of a
fund. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, has concluded that the cost allocation methodology
employed by the Investment Advisers has a reasonable basis and is appropriate in light of all of the circumstances. It
considered the profits realized by the Investment Advisers in connection with the operation of a fund and whether the
amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of a fund. It also considered the profits realized from
non-fund businesses which may benefit from or be related to a fund's business. The Board of Trustees, including the
non-interested Trustees, also considered the Investment Advisers' profit margins in comparison with available industry
data, both accounting for and excluding marketing expenses.

<R></R>Economies of Scale. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, considered whether
there have been economies of scale in respect of the management of the Fidelity funds, whether the Fidelity funds
(including each fund) have appropriately benefitted from any economies of scale, and whether there is potential for
realization of any further economies of scale. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, has
concluded that any potential economies of scale are being shared between fund shareholders and the Investment Advisers
in an appropriate manner.

<R></R>Other Benefits to the Investment Advisers. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees,
also considered the character and amount of fees paid by each fund and each fund's shareholders for services provided by
the Investment Advisers and their affiliates, including fees for services like transfer agency, fund accounting, and direct
shareholder services. It also considered the allocation of fund brokerage to brokers affiliated with the Investment
Advisers, the receipt of sales loads and payments under Rule 12b-1 plans in respect of certain of the Fidelity funds, and
benefits to the Investment Advisers from the use of "soft" dollar commissions to pay for research and other similar
services. The Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, also considered the revenues and profitability of
the Investment Advisers businesses other than their mutual fund business, including the Investment Advisers' retail
brokerage, correspondent brokerage, capital markets, trust, investment advisory, pension record keeping, insurance,
publishing, real estate, international research and investment funds, and others. The Board of Trustees, including the
non-interested Trustees, considered the intangible benefits that accrue to the Investment Advisers and their affiliates by
virtue of their relationship with each fund.

<R></R>Conclusion. Based on its evaluation of all material factors and assisted by the advice of independent
counsel, the Board of Trustees, including the non-interested Trustees, concluded that the existing advisory fee structures
are fair, reasonable, and that the existing Investment Advisory Contracts should be continued.

DISTRIBUTION SERVICES

Each fund has entered into a distribution agreement with FDC, an affiliate of FMR. FDC is a broker-dealer registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The
distribution agreements call for FDC to use all reasonable efforts, consistent with its other business, to secure purchasers for
shares of the funds, which are continuously offered at NAV. Promotional and administrative expenses in connection with the
offer and sale of shares are paid by FMR.

The Trustees have approved Distribution and Service Plans on behalf of each fund (the Plans) pursuant to Rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act (the Rule). The Rule provides in substance that a mutual fund may not engage directly or indirectly in
financing any activity that is primarily intended to result in the sale of shares of the fund except pursuant to a plan approved
on behalf of the fund under the Rule. The Plans, as approved by the Trustees, allow the funds and FMR to incur certain
expenses that might be considered to constitute indirect payment by the funds of distribution expenses.

Under each Plan, if the payment of management fees by the fund to FMR is deemed to be indirect financing by the fund
of the distribution of its shares, such payment is authorized by the Plan. Each Plan specifically recognizes that FMR may use
its management fee revenue, as well as its past profits or its other resources, to pay FDC for expenses incurred in connection
with providing services intended to result in the sale of fund shares and/or shareholder support services. In addition, each
Plan provides that FMR, directly or through FDC, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries, such as banks,
broker-dealers, and other service-providers, that provide those services. Currently, the Board of Trustees has authorized
such payments for Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market, Spartan U.S. Government Money Market, and Spartan Money
Market shares.

Prior to approving each Plan, the Trustees carefully considered all pertinent factors relating to the implementation of the
Plan, and determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Plan will benefit the fund and its shareholders. In
particular, the Trustees noted that each Plan does not authorize payments by the fund other than those made to FMR under its
management contract with the fund. To the extent that each Plan gives FMR and FDC greater flexibility in connection with
the distribution of fund shares, additional sales of fund shares or stabilization of cash flows may result. Furthermore, certain
shareholder support services may be provided more effectively under the Plans by local entities with whom shareholders
have other relationships.

Each fund may execute portfolio transactions with, and purchase securities issued by, depository institutions that receive
payments under the Plans. No preference for the instruments of such depository institutions will be shown in the selection of
investments.

FDC may compensate intermediaries that satisfy certain criteria established from time to time by FDC relating to the
level or type of services provided by the intermediary, the sale or expected sale of significant amounts of shares, or other
factors.

TRANSFER AND SERVICE AGENT AGREEMENTS

Each fund has entered into a transfer agent agreement with Fidelity Service Company<R>, Inc.</R> (FSC), an affiliate
of FMR. Under the terms of the agreements, FSC performs transfer agency, dividend disbursing, and shareholder services
for each fund.

For providing transfer agency services, FSC receives a position fee and an asset-based fee each paid monthly with
respect to each position in a fund. For retail accounts and certain institutional accounts, these fees are based on size of
position and fund type. For certain institutional retirement accounts, these fees are based on fund type. For certain other
institutional retirement accounts, these fees are based on account type and fund type. The position fees are subject to
increase based on postage rate changes.

FSC also collects fees charged in connection with providing certain types of services such as exchanges, closing out
fund balances, maintaining fund positions with low balances, checkwriting, wire transactions, and providing historical
account research.

In addition, FSC receives the pro rata portion of the transfer agency fees applicable to shareholder accounts in a qualified
state tuition program (QSTP), as defined under the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, managed by FMR or an
affiliate and in each Fidelity Freedom Fund® and Fidelity Four-in-One Index Fund, funds of funds managed by an FMR
affiliate, according to the percentage of the QSTP's, Freedom Fund's, or Fidelity Four-in-One Index Fund's assets that is
invested in a fund, subject to certain limitations in the case of Fidelity Four-in-One Index Fund.

FSC pays out-of-pocket expenses associated with providing transfer agent services. In addition, FSC bears the expense
of typesetting, printing, and mailing prospectuses, statements of additional information, and all other reports, notices, and
statements to existing shareholders, with the exception of proxy statements.

Each fund has also entered into a service agent agreement with FSC. Under the terms of the agreement, FSC calculates
the NAV and dividends for each fund and maintains each fund's portfolio and general accounting records.

For providing pricing and bookkeeping services, FSC receives a monthly fee based on each fund's average daily net
assets throughout the month.

FMR bears the cost of transfer agency, dividend disbursing, and shareholder services and pricing and bookkeeping
services under the terms of its management contract with each fund.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST

Trust Organization. Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, Spartan U.S. Government Money Market Fund, and
Spartan Money Market Fund are funds of Fidelity Hereford Street Trust, an open-end management investment company
organized as a Delaware business trust on November 18, 1993. Currently, there are three funds in Fidelity Hereford Street
Trust: Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, Spartan U.S. Government Money Market Fund, and Spartan Money
Market Fund. The Trustees are permitted to create additional funds in the trust and to create additional classes of the funds.

The assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds
thereof, subject to the rights of creditors, are allocated to such fund, and constitute the underlying assets of such fund. The
underlying assets of each fund in the trust shall be charged with the liabilities and expenses attributable to such fund. Any
general expenses of the trust shall be allocated between or among any one or more of the funds.

Shareholder Liability. The trust is a business trust organized under Delaware law. Delaware law provides that
shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitations of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations
for profit. The courts of some states, however, may decline to apply Delaware law on this point. The Trust Instrument
contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses of the trust. The
Trust Instrument provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase
price of shares and requires that each agreement, obligation, or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the
Trustees relating to the trust or to a fund shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or to
one or more funds and its or their assets. The Trust Instrument further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a
claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund.

The Trust Instrument provides for indemnification out of each fund's property of any shareholder or former shareholder
held personally liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not
because of his or her acts or omissions or for some other reason. The Trust Instrument also provides that each fund shall,
upon request, assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy
any judgment thereon. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to
circumstances in which Delaware law does not apply, no contractual limitation of liability was in effect, and a fund is unable
to meet its obligations. FMR believes that, in view of the above, the risk of personal liability to shareholders is extremely
remote.

Voting Rights. Each fund's capital consists of shares of beneficial interest. As a shareholder, you are entitled to one vote
for each dollar of net asset value you own. The voting rights of shareholders can be changed only by a shareholder vote.
Shares may be voted in the aggregate, by fund, and by class.

The shares have no preemptive or conversion rights. Shares are fully paid and nonassessable, except as set forth under
the heading "Shareholder Liability" above.

The trust or a fund or a class may be terminated upon the sale of its assets to, or merger with, another open-end
management investment company, series, or class thereof, or upon liquidation and distribution of its assets. Generally, the
merger of the trust or a fund or a class with another operating mutual fund or the sale of all or a portion of the assets of
<R>the</R> trust or a fund or a class to another operating mutual fund requires approval by a vote of shareholders of the
trust or the fund or the class. The Trustees may, however, reorganize or terminate the trust or a fund or a class without prior
shareholder approval. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the trust, shareholders of each of its funds are entitled
to receive the underlying assets of such fund available for distribution. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of a fund
or a class, shareholders of that fund or that class are entitled to receive the underlying assets of the fund or class available for
distribution.

Custodians. The Bank of New York, 110 Washington Street, New York, New York, is custodian of the assets of each
fund. The custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of a fund's assets and the appointment of any subcustodian banks and
clearing agencies. <R>JPMorgan Chase Bank,</R> headquartered in New York, also may serve as a special purpose
custodian of certain assets in connection with repurchase agreement transactions.

FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, and Members of the Board of Trustees may, from time to time,
conduct transactions with various banks, including banks serving as custodians for certain funds advised by FMR.
Transactions that have occurred to date include mortgages and personal and general business loans. In the judgment of
FMR, the terms and conditions of those transactions were not influenced by existing or potential custodial or other fund
relationships.

Auditor. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 160 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts, serves as independent accountant
for each fund. The auditor examines financial statements for the funds and provides other audit, tax, and related services.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Each fund's financial statements and financial highlights for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2002<R>,</R> and report of
the auditor, are included in the fund's annual report and are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 24.  Trusts Controlled by or under Common Control with this Trust

The Board of Trustees of the Trust is the same as the board of other Fidelity
funds, each of which has Fidelity Management & Research Company, or an affiliate,
as its investment adviser. In addition, the officers of the Trust are substantially
identical to those of the other Fidelity funds.  Nonetheless, the Trust takes the
position that it is not under common control with other Fidelity funds because the
power residing in the respective boards and officers arises as the result of an official
position with the respective trusts.





Item 25.  Indemnification

  Pursuant to Del. Code Ann. title 12 § 3817, a Delaware business trust
may provide in its governing instrument for the indemnification of its officers and
trustees from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever. Article X,
Section 10.02 of the Trust Instrument sets forth the reasonable and fair means for
determining whether indemnification shall be provided to any past or present
Trustee or officer. It states that the Trust shall indemnify any present or past trustee
or officer to the fullest extent permitted by law against liability, and all expenses
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with any claim, action, suit or
proceeding in which he or she is involved by virtue of his or her service as a trustee
or officer and against any amount incurred in settlement thereof. Indemnification
will not be provided to a person adjudged by a court or other adjudicatory body to
be liable to the Trust or its shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith,
gross negligence or reckless disregard of his or her duties (collectively, "disabling
conduct"), or not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her
action was in the best interest of the Trust. In the event of a settlement, no
indemnification may be provided unless there has been a determination, as specified
in the Trust Instrument, that the officer or trustee did not engage in disabling
conduct.

  Pursuant to Section 11 of the Distribution Agreement, the Trust agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor and each of its directors and officers
and each person, if any, who controls the Distributor within the meaning of Section
15 of the 1933 Act against any loss, liability, claim, damages or expense (including
the reasonable cost of investigating or defending any alleged loss, liability, claim,
damages, or expense and reasonable counsel fees incurred in connection therewith)
arising by reason of any person acquiring any shares, based upon the ground that the
registration statement, Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information, shareholder
reports or other information filed or made public by the Trust (as from time to time
amended) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated or necessary in order to make the statements not
misleading under the 1933 Act, or any other statute or the common law. However,
the Trust does not agree to indemnify the Distributor or hold it harmless to the
extent that the statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity
with, information furnished to the Trust by or on behalf of the Distributor. In no case
is the indemnity of the Trust in favor of the Distributor or any person indemnified to
be deemed to protect the Distributor or any person against any liability to the Issuer
or its security holders to which the Distributor or such person would otherwise be
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties under this Agreement.

  Pursuant to the agreement by which Fidelity Service Company, Inc. ("FSC")
is appointed transfer agent, the Trust agrees to indemnify and hold FSC harmless
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable
counsel fees and expenses) resulting from:

  (1)  any claim, demand, action or suit brought by any person other than
the Trust, including by a shareholder, which names FSC and/or the Trust as a party
and is not based on and does not result from FSC's willful misfeasance, bad faith or
negligence or reckless disregard of duties, and arises out of or in connection with
FSC's performance under the Transfer Agency Agreement; or

  (2)  any claim, demand, action or suit (except to the extent contributed to
by FSC's willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence or reckless disregard of its
duties) which results from the negligence of the Trust, or from FSC's acting upon
any instruction(s) reasonably believed by it to have been executed or communicated
by any person duly authorized by the Trust, or as a result of FSC's acting in reliance
upon advice reasonably believed by FSC to have been given by counsel for the
Trust, or as a result of FSC's acting in reliance upon any instrument or stock
certificate reasonably believed by it to have been genuine and signed, countersigned
or executed by the proper person.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of Massachusetts or Delaware, as applicable. Each Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.[2] 
           FMR Co., SAI or another FMR entity serves as investment adviser or sub-adviser to each of the Funds. FMR Co. and SAI are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Any investment adviser to the Funds will be registered under the Advisers Act.
2. The Prior Order permits the Funds to participate in a credit facility administered by FMR (the “IFL Program”). The IFL Program enables the Funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes, such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels. The IFL Program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the Funds and enhance the lending Funds' ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their short-term balances. The Prior Order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the IFL Program (the “IFL Rate”) be based on the average of: (a) the higher of the overnight time deposit rate (the “OTD Rate”) and the Funds' current overnight repurchase agreement rate (the “FICASH Rate”); [3] 
           and (b) a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the Funds (“Benchmark Rate”). The board of trustees (each, a “Fund Board” and collectively, the “Fund Boards”) of each Fund, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, (“Independent Trustees”) establishes the Benchmark Rate, and, reviews, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate. The Benchmark Rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the Federal Funds rate over the previous 60 days.
3. Applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Therefore, applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to eliminate the use of the OTD Rate in the IFL Rate calculation provided in conditions 1 and 2 (“Rate Conditions”). Applicants also request an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person, directly or indirectly, if that person controls or is under common control with that company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.” Because the Funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser  that is under common control with those of the other Funds, applicants state that each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other Funds, and, therefore, an affiliated person of those Funds.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling securities or other property to the investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits registered open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank, if immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” generally includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness.
4. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements. The requested order would amend the Rate Conditions in the Prior Order and grant applicants an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
7. As noted previously, applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Applicants state further that the IFL Rate, as amended, would make it more likely that lending Funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing Funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the IFL Program if the IFL Rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate. Applicants state that the Rate Conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the Funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing Funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity.
8. Applicants also state that the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, will not involve any potential that one Fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another Fund. Applicants state that under the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, rates will be set under a pre-established formula, approved by the Fund Boards. Applicants state that all Funds participating in the IFL Program, as revised by the Rate Conditions, on any given day will receive the same interest rate.
9. Applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the Rate Conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the Act, and meet the standards set forth in sections 6(c), 12(d)(1)(J), 17(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act. Applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the Rate Conditions would be reasonable and fair, would not involve overreaching, and would be consistent with the investment policies of the Funds and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants submit further that each Fund's participation in the IFL Program would be consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and would be on a basis which is no different from, or less advantageous than that of any other participant.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The IFL Rate to be charged to the Funds under the IFL Program will be the average of: (a) the FICASH Rate and (b) the Benchmark Rate.
2. On each business day, the Cash Management Services Department (“Cash Management Department”) of Fidelity Service Company, Inc. will compare the IFL Rate calculated as provided in condition 1 with the FICASH Rate that day and all short-term borrowing rates quoted to any of the Funds by any bank with which any Fund has a loan agreement. At least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any Fund borrows through the IFL Program prior to such borrowing. The Cash Management Department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the IFL Rate is more favorable to the lending Fund than the FICASH Rate and more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any interfund loans to the Fund (i) will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan, (ii) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, (iii) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and (iv) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund  loan agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the IFL Program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the IFL Program only on a secured basis. A Fund could not borrow through the IFL Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter (i) repay all its outstanding interfund loans, (ii) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets, or (iii) secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required. Until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceed 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the IFL Program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the IFL Program to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's interfund loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. Each interfund loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
10. A Fund's participation in the IFL Program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents. No Fund may borrow through the IFL Program unless the Fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the Fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes (and not for leveraging), except that certain Funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose.
11. The Cash Management Department will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the IFL Program, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the Funds. The Cash Management Department will not solicit cash for the IFL Program from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers. Cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in FICASH, or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by FMR Co. or another FMR entity, or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the Funds.
12. FMR will monitor the IFL Rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the Fund Boards concerning the participation of the Funds in the IFL Program and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the IFL Program.
13. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will: 
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the IFL Program during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions, 
(b) Establish the Benchmark Rate formula used to determine the interest rate on interfund loans, and review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate formula, and 
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the IFL Program.
14. In the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the interfund loan agreement, FMR will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning interfund loans.[4] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any problem promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to the Fund Boards setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
15. Each Fund will maintain and preserve, for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the IFL Program occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the IFL Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund's respective Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 12 and 13.
16. Each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examination of the Fund, will review the operation of the IFL Program for compliance with the conditions of the application and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR. Applicants will report on the operations of the IFL Program at the Fund Board meetings on a quarterly basis. 

17. No Fund will be permitted to participate in the IFL Program unless the Fund has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information all material facts about its intended participation.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
