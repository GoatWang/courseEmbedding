Fitch Rates Honda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Honda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust; Outlook Stable
    





October 25, 2016 05:21 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Honda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust:
    

      --$360,000,000 class A-1 Not Rated ('NR')
    

      --$570,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$450,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$120,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,464,271 Certificates 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2016-4 as measured by the 
      weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 764 and internal 
      credit score tiering is consistent with recent pools. New vehicles total 
      95.1% and the WA seasoning is 13.5 months.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 2.75% 
      (subordination of 2.50% and a 0.25% reserve). A yield supplement account 
      (YSA) increases the effective WA APR, resulting in excess spread (XS) of 
      2.53%. All structural features are consistent with 2015 - 2016 
      transactions.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on AHFC's portfolio 
      and 2010 - 2016 securitizations have been low historically and remained 
      well below peak levels in 2008 due to stronger quality originations, the 
      improved U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle values.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates AHFC 'F1' and Honda, its parent, 
      'F1'/'A'/Stable Rating Outlook. AHFC has recorded positive corporate 
      financial results in recent years, while the overall health of Honda has 
      remained strong.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AHFC demonstrates 
      adequate capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and 
      securitization performance. Fitch deems AHFC capable of servicing this 
      series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AHFC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all 
      classes of 2016-4 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating 
      of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The 
      notes could experience a downgrade of up to two rating categories under 
      Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on a random sample of 287 
      receivables selected from the 128,973 receivables (as of Aug. 31, 2016). 
      A comparison was made of the various attributes of each of the selected 
      receivables (first payment date, original amount financed, among others) 
      in the data file to contractual documents provided by the company. Based 
      on the results of the procedures, KPMG concluded with a 99% confidence 
      level that the maximum estimated error occurrence rate for each of the 
      attributes does not exceed 5%.
    

      A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link found at the end 
      of this rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the report titled 'Honda Auto Receivables

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not

Fitch Rates Honda Auto Receivables 2016-1 Owner Trust; Outlook Stable



2016-02-25 19:58:50









NEW YORK--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the Honda Auto Receivables 2016-1 Owner Trust notes:
--$265,700,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
--$312,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$332,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$90,300,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--$25,648,881 certificates 'NR'.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
Strong Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2016-1, as measured by the weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 761 and internal credit score tiering, is consistent with recent pools. New vehicles total 93.7%, and the WA seasoning is 13.6 months.
Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 2.75% (subordination of 2.50% and a 0.25% reserve). A yield supplement account (YSA) increases the effective WA annual percentage rate (APR) and, thus, excess spread (XS), which totals 2.67%, higher than 2015-4 (NR) and 2015-3.
Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on American Honda Finance Corporation's (AHFC) portfolio and 2010-2015 securitizations have been low historically and remained well below peak levels from 2008 due to stronger quality originations and healthy used vehicle values. Fitch's base case loss proxy remains at 0.90%; however, pool-factor projections of recent HAROT securitizations suggest 2016-1 could be expected to perform within a 0.35%-0.45% range, assuming stable macroeconomic conditions.
Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates AHFC 'F1' and its parent, Honda, 'A/F1'/Outlook Stable. AHFC has recorded positive corporate financial results in recent years, while the overall health of Honda has remained strong.
Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AHFC demonstrates adequate capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance. Fitch deems AHFC capable of servicing 2016-1.
Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of AHFC would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-1 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience a downgrade of two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on a random sample of 287 receivables selected from the 97,109 receivables (as of Dec. 31, 2015). A comparison was made of the various attributes of each of the selected receivables (first payment date, original amount financed, among others) in the data file to contractual documents provided by the company. Based on the results of the procedures, KPMG concluded with a 99% confidence level that the maximum estimated error occurrence rate for each of the attributes does not exceed 5%.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(FICO) score of 765 and internal credit score tiering is consistent with recent pools. New vehicles total 95.1% and the WA seasoning is 13.6 months.Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 2.75% (subordination of 2.50% and a 0.25% reserve). A yield supplement account (YSA) increases the effective WA APR, resulting in excess spread (XS) of 2.30%. All structural features are consistent with 2015-2016 transactions.Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on AHFC's portfolio and 2010-2016 securitizations have been low historically and remained well below peak levels in 2008 due to stronger quality originations, the improved U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle values.Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates AHFC 'F1' and Honda, its parent, 'F1'/'A' with a Stable Rating Outlook. AHFC has recorded positive corporate financial results in recent years, while the overall health of Honda has remained strong.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AHFC demonstrates adequate capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance. Fitch deems AHFC capable of servicing this series.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of AHFC would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-4 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience a downgrade of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenarioUSE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on a random sample of 287 receivables selected from the 128,973 receivables (as of Aug. 31, 2016). A comparison was made of the various attributes of each of the selected receivables (first payment date, original amount financed, among others) in the data file to contractual documents provided by the company. Based on the results of the procedures, KPMG concluded with a 99% confidence level that the maximum estimated error occurrence rate for each of the attributes does not exceed 5%.A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link found at the end of this rating action commentary.REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMSFitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in the report titled 'Honda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Read MoreRating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchHonda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust (US ABS)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/888996Honda Auto Receivables 2016-4 Owner Trust - Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889035Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013055ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013055&flm_nm=15e_1013055_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013055Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

The Indenture Trustee shall, upon
Issuer Order, authenticate and deliver for original issue the
following aggregate principal amount of Notes: (i) $360,000,000 of
Class A-1 Notes, (ii) $570,000,000 of Class A-2 Notes, (iii)
$450,000,000 of Class A-3 Notes and (iv) $120,000,000 of Class A-4
Notes. The aggregate principal amount of Class A-1 Notes, Class A-2
Notes, Class A-3 Notes and Class A-4 Notes outstanding at any time
may not exceed such respective amounts except as provided in
Section 2.05.

 

Each Note shall be dated the date of
its authentication. The Notes shall be issuable as registered Notes
in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof.

 

No Note shall be entitled to any
benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose, unless there appears on such Note a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Indenture Trustee by the manual signature of one of
its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Note
shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note
has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

 

Section 2.03. Temporary Notes
. Pending the preparation of Definitive Notes pursuant to Section
2.11, the Issuer may execute, and upon receipt of an Issuer Order
the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary
Notes that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or
otherwise produced, of the tenor of the Definitive Notes in lieu of
which they are issued and with such variations not inconsistent
with the terms of this Indenture as the officers executing such
Notes may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such
Notes.

 

If temporary Notes are issued, the
Issuer shall cause Definitive Notes to be prepared without
unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the
temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon
surrender of the temporary Notes at the office or agency of the
Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 3.02, without charge
to the related Noteholder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any
one or more temporary Notes, the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor, a like tenor and principal amount of Definitive Notes of
authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes
shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as Definitive Notes.

Section 2.04. Note Register,
Registration of Transfer and Exchange . The Issuer shall cause
to be kept a register (the “ Note Register ”) in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe,
the Issuer shall provide for the registration of Notes and the
registration of all transfers of Notes. The Indenture Trustee
initially shall be the “ Note Registrar ” for
the purpose of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein
provided. Upon any resignation of any Note Registrar, the Issuer
shall promptly appoint a successor or, if it elects not to make
such an appointment, assume the duties of Note
Registrar.

 

If a Person other than the Indenture
Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the Issuer
will give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of the
appointment of such Note Registrar and of the location, and any
change in the location, of the Note Register and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all
reasonable times and to obtain copies thereof, and the Indenture
Trustee shall have the right to rely upon a certificate executed on
behalf of the Note Registrar by an Executive Officer thereof as to
the names and addresses of the Noteholders and the principal
amounts and number of such Notes.

 

Upon surrender for registration of
transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the Issuer to be
maintained as provided in Section 3.02, provided that the
requirements of Section
8-401 of the UCC are met, the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall
obtain from the Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated
transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes of the same Class
in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal
amount.

 

At the option of the Noteholder,
Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or
agency. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange,
provided that the requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met
(as determined by the Issuer), the Issuer shall execute, and the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall
obtain from the Indenture Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.

 

All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

 

Every Note presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed by,
or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the
Noteholder thereof or such Noteholder’s attorney duly
authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by an
“eligible guarantor institution” meeting the
requirements of the Note Registrar, which requirements include
membership or participation in the Securities Transfer
Agent’s Medallion Program (“STAMP”) or such other
“signature guarantee program” as may be determined by
the Note Registrar in addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP,
all in accordance with the Exchange Act.

 

No service charge shall be made to a
Noteholder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes,
but the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.03 or
9.06 not involving any transfer.

 

4



 


 

Neither the Issuer nor the Note
Registrar will be required to register transfers or exchanges of
Notes that will be redeemed within fifteen (15) days after the
requested date of transfer or exchange.

 

Any Notes issued to and beneficially
owned by the Depositor or any other person treated as the same
person as the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes may not
be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred unless counsel
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee has rendered an opinion to
the effect that such Notes to be sold, pledged, or otherwise
transferred will be characterized as indebtedness for U.S. federal
income tax purposes after such sale, pledge, or other transfer. Any
attempted sale, pledge, or other transfer in contravention of this
paragraph will be void ab initio and the purported
transferor will continue to be treated as the owner of such Notes.
If for tax or other reasons it may be necessary to track any Notes,
tracking conditions such as requiring separate CUSIPs or definitive
form instruments may be required by the Depositor or the
Administrator as a condition to such transfer.

 

Section 2.04A.  
Transfer Restrictions on the Class A-1 Notes .

 

(a)      On the
Closing Date, 100% of the Class A-1 Notes will be registered in the
name of the Depositor and issued in physical form as a Definitive
Note in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto. No transfer of a
Class A-1 Note, other than to an Affiliate of the Depositor, shall
be made unless such transfer is made pursuant to, (i) an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act and any applicable
state securities laws or, (ii) is exempt from the registration
requirements under the Securities Act and such state securities
laws. Except in the case of a transfer by the Depositor to an
Affiliate, in the event that a transfer is to be made in reliance
upon an exemption from the Securities Act and state securities
laws, in order to assure compliance with the Securities Act and
such laws, the Noteholder desiring to effect such transfer and such
Noteholder’s prospective transferee shall each certify to the
Owner Trustee, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor
in writing the facts surrounding the transfer in substantially the
forms set forth in Exhibit B (the “ Transferor
Certificate ”) and Exhibit C (the “
Investment Letter ”). Except in the case of a transfer
by the Depositor to an Affiliate, there shall also be delivered to
the Owner Trustee, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee an opinion
of counsel that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption
from the Securities Act and state securities laws, which opinion of
counsel shall not be an expense of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or
the Indenture Trustee; provided that such opinion of counsel in
respect of the applicable state securities laws may be a memorandum
of law rather than an opinion if such counsel is not licensed in
the applicable jurisdiction. If the Depositor subsequently
transfers any of the Class A-1 Notes in a transaction exempt from
the registration requirements under the Securities Act pursuant to
Section 4(2) thereof and any Noteholder intends to transfer the
Class A-1 Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, the Depositor shall provide
to any Noteholder and any prospective transferee designated by any
such Noteholder information regarding the Class A-1 Notes and the
Receivables and such other information as shall be necessary to
satisfy the condition to eligibility set forth in Rule 144A(d)(4)
for transfer of any such Class A-1 Notes without registration
thereof under the Securities Act pursuant to the registration
exemption provided by Rule 144A, in each case with the cost of the
provision of such information to be borne by the requesting
noteholder. Each Noteholder desiring to effect such a transfer
shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Depositor and AHFC (in any
capacity) against any liability that may result if the transfer is
not so exempt or is not made in accordance with federal and state
securities laws.

(b)      The Class
A-1 Notes issued to and held by the Depositor or its Affiliates may
not be sold, pledged, or otherwise transferred unless counsel
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee has rendered an opinion to
the effect that such Class A-1 Notes to be sold, pledged, or
otherwise transferred by the Depositor or its Affiliates will be
characterized as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes
after such sale, pledge, or other transfer. Any attempted sale,
pledge, or other transfer in contravention of this Section 2.04A
will be void ab initio and the purported transferor will
continue to be treated as the owner of the Class A-1
Notes.

 

(c)      By
directly or indirectly acquiring a Class A-1 Note in a transaction
pursuant to Rule 144A, each initial purchaser, transferee and owner
of an ownership or beneficial interest will be required to
represent, warrant and agree (if in Definitive Note form) or will
be deemed to represent, warrant and agree (if in Book Entry Note
form) as follows:

 

(i)      it
understands that the Class A-1 Notes have not been registered under
the Securities Act, but were retained by the Depositor, and may not
be sold except as permitted in the following sentence. It
understands and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of any
accounts for which it is acting as hereinafter stated, (x) that
such Class A-1 Notes are being offered only in a transaction not
involving any public offering within the meaning of the Securities
Act and (y) that such Class A-1 Notes may be resold, pledged or
transferred only (i) to the Depositor or an Affiliate, (ii) to an
“accredited investor” as defined in Rule
501(a)(1),(2),(3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act
(an “Accredited Investor”) acting for its own account
(and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for
others (which others also are Accredited Investors unless the
holder is a bank acting in its fiduciary capacity) that executes a
certificate substantially in the form of the Investment Letter,
(iii) so long as such Class A-1 Note is eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person whom it
reasonably believes after due inquiry is a “qualified
institutional buyer” as defined in Rule 144A, acting for its
own account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary
or agent for others (which others also are “qualified
institutional buyers”) to whom notice is given that the
resale, pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A
or (iv) in a sale, pledge or other transfer made in a transaction
otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, in which case the Indenture Trustee shall require
that both the prospective transferor and the prospective transferee
certify to the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor in writing the
facts surrounding such transfer, which certification shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor. Except in the
case of a transfer described in clauses (i) or (iii) above, the
Indenture Trustee shall require that a written opinion of counsel
(which will not be at the expense of the Depositor, any affiliate
of the Depositor, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee),
reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor, be delivered to the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor to the
effect that such transfer will not violate the Securities Act, and
will be effected in accordance with any applicable securities laws
of each state of the United States. It will notify any purchaser of
the Class A-1 Notes from it of the above resale restrictions, if
then applicable. It further understands that in connection with any
transfer of the Class A-1 Notes by it that the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Depositor may request, and
if so requested it will furnish, such certificates and other
information as they may reasonably require to confirm that any such
transfer complies with the foregoing restrictions;

(ii)      if
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, it is a “qualified
institutional buyer” as defined under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and is acquiring the Class A-1 Notes for its own
account (and not for the account of others) or as a fiduciary or
agent for others (which others also are “qualified
institutional buyers”). It is familiar with Rule 144A under
the Securities Act and is aware that the seller of the Class A-1
Notes and other parties intend to rely on the foregoing
representations, warranties and acknowledgements and the exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided
by Rule 144A;

 

(iii)      if in
Definitive Note form, it satisfies the requirements of Section 2.14
of this Indenture;

 

(iv)      it
understands that the Indenture Trustee, the Depositor and others
will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing
acknowledgments, representations and agreements, and it agrees that
if any of the acknowledgments, representations and warranties
deemed to have been made by it by its purchase of the Class A-1
Notes, for its own account or for one or more accounts as to each
of which it exercises sole investment discretion, are no longer
accurate, it shall promptly notify the Depositor; and

 

(v)      the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor are entitled to rely upon the
foregoing representations, warranties and acknowledgements and are
irrevocably authorized to produce the foregoing representations,
warranties and acknowledgments or a copy hereof to any interested
party in any administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry
with respect to the matters covered hereby.

 

Section 2.05.  
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes . If (i) any
mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the
Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Note, (ii) there is delivered to
the Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required
by it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless and
(iii) the requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC are met, then,
in the absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a Protected
Purchaser, the Issuer shall execute, and upon its written request
the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange
for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Note, a replacement Note of the same Class; provided, however, that
if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated
Note, shall have become or within seven (7) days shall be due and
payable, or shall have been called for redemption, instead of
issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may pay such destroyed, lost
or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption Date
without surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of such
replacement Note or payment of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note
pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, a Protected
Purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such replacement
Note was issued presents for payment such original Note, the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover such
replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to whom it was
delivered or any Person taking such replacement Note from such
Person to whom such replacement Note was delivered or any assignee
of such Person, except a protected purchaser, and shall be entitled
to recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the
extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer
or the Indenture Trustee in connection therewith.

Upon the issuance of any replacement
Note under this Section, the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may
require the payment by the Noteholder of such Note of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee or the
Note Registrar) connected therewith.

 

Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.

 

The provisions of this Section are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

Deemed Owner . Prior to due presentment for registration of

is registered (as of the day of determination) as the owner of such
Note for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and
interest, if any, on such Note and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note be overdue, and none of the

such Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered on the
Record Date by check mailed first-class postage prepaid to such
Person’s address as it appears on the Note Register on such
Record Date, except that, unless Definitive Notes have been issued
pursuant to Section 2.11, with respect to Notes registered on the
Record Date in the name of the nominee of the Clearing Agency
(initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.), payment will be
made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account
designated by such nominee and except for the final installment of
principal payable with respect to such Note on a Payment Date, a
Redemption Date or on the related Final Scheduled Payment Date, as
the case may be (and except for the Redemption Price for any Note

returned undelivered shall be held in accordance with Section
3.03.

(b)      The
principal of each Note shall be payable as provided in Section
8.02(d) hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the entire unpaid
principal amount of the Notes shall be due and payable, if not
previously paid, on the related Final Scheduled Payment Date or the
date on which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, if the Indenture Trustee or Noteholders representing
not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount have declared
the Notes to be immediately due and payable in the manner provided
in Section 5.02. All principal payments on each Class of Notes
shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders of such Class entitled
thereto. The Indenture Trustee shall notify the Person in whose
name a Note is registered at the close of business five (5)
Business Days preceding the Payment Date on which the Issuer
expects that the final installment of principal of and interest on
such Note will be paid. Such notice shall be mailed or transmitted
by facsimile prior to such final Payment Date and shall specify
that such final installment will be payable only upon presentation
and surrender of such Note and shall specify the place where such
Note may be presented and surrendered for payment of such
installment. Notices in connection with redemptions of Notes shall
be mailed to Noteholders as provided in Section 10.02.

 

(c)      If the
Issuer defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, the Issuer
shall pay defaulted interest (plus interest on such defaulted
interest to the extent lawful) at the applicable Interest Rate in
any lawful manner. The Issuer may pay such defaulted interest to
the Persons who are Noteholders on a subsequent special record
date, which date shall be at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the next payment date. The Issuer shall fix or cause to be fixed
any such special record date and related payment date, and, at
least fifteen (15) days before any such special record date, the
Issuer shall mail to each Noteholder a notice that states the
special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted
interest to be paid.

 

Section 2.08.  
Cancellation .  All Notes surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer, exchange or redemption shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled
by the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer may at any time deliver to the
Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall
be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee. No Notes shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as
provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this
Indenture. All cancelled Notes may be held or disposed of by the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard retention or
disposal policy as in effect at the time unless the Issuer shall
direct by an Issuer Order that they be destroyed or returned to it;
provided, that such Issuer Order is timely and the Notes have not
been previously disposed of by the Indenture Trustee.

 

Section 2.09.  
Book-Entry Notes .  The Notes, upon original
issuance, will be issued in the form of a typewritten Note or Notes
representing the Book-Entry Notes, to be delivered to the Indenture
Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company, the initial
Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Issuer. The Book-Entry
Notes shall be registered initially on the Note Register in the
name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency,
and no Note Owner will receive a definitive Note representing such
Note Owner’s interest in such Note, except as provided in
Section 2.11. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Notes
(the “Definitive Notes”) have been issued to such Note
Owners pursuant to Section 2.11:

(i)       the
provisions of this Section shall be in full force and
effect;

 

(ii)      the Note
Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with
the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Indenture (including
the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes and the
giving of instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole holder
of the Notes, and shall have no obligation to the Note
Owners;

 

(iii)      to the
extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with any other
provisions of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section shall
control;

 

(iv)      the
rights of Note Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing
Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and
agreements between such Note Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or
the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Note Depository
Agreement, unless and until Definitive Notes are issued pursuant to
Section 2.11, the Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers
among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit
payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to such Clearing
Agency Participants; and

 

(v)       whenever
this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon
instructions or directions of Noteholders evidencing a specified
percentage of the Outstanding Amount, the Clearing Agency shall be
deemed to represent such percentage only to the extent that it has
received instructions to such effect from Note Owners and/or
Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing, respectively,
such required percentage of the beneficial interest in the Notes
and has delivered such instructions to the Indenture
Trustee.

 

Section 2.10.   Notices
to Clearing Agency .  Whenever a notice or other
communication to the Noteholders is required under this Indenture,
unless and until Definitive Notes shall have been issued to such
Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.11, the Indenture Trustee shall
give all such notices and communications specified herein to be
given to Noteholders to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no
obligation to such Note Owners.

Section 2.11.  
Definitive Notes . On the Closing Date, all of the Class A-1
Notes will be issued in physical form as the form of Definitive
Notes, in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto and registered in
the name of the Depositor. The Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes
and the Class A-4 Notes will be issued on the Closing Date as
Book-Entry Notes; however, if at anytime (i)(A) the Administrator
advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency
is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its
responsibilities with respect to the Book-Entry Notes and (B)
neither the Indenture Trustee nor the Administrator is able to
locate a qualified successor, (ii) the Administrator at its option
advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or
(iii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Servicer
Default, Owners of Book-Entry Notes representing beneficial
interests aggregating at least a majority of the Outstanding Amount
of such Notes advise the Indenture Trustee and the Clearing Agency
Participants through the Clearing Agency, in writing that the
continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is
no longer in the best interests of such Note Owners, then, in each
case, the Indenture Trustee shall notify all Note Owners of the
related Class of Notes through the Clearing Agency of the
occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive
Notes of the related Class of Notes to Note Owners requesting the
same. Upon surrender to the Indenture Trustee of the Note or Notes
representing the Book-Entry Notes by the Clearing Agency,
accompanied by registration instructions, the Issuer shall execute
and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate the Definitive Notes
in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of
the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be
liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may
conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such
instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Notes of a Class, the
Indenture Trustee shall recognize the holders of the Definitive
Notes as Noteholders hereunder. Subsequent Noteholders of the Class
A-1 Notes that are unaffiliated with the Depositor shall have the
right, but at such Noteholders sole cost and expense, to request
that the Class A-1 Notes be converted to Book Entry Notes and the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Administrative Agent and the
Depositor agree to cooperate and use reasonable efforts to effect
such conversion.

 

Section 2.12.   Release
of Collateral .  Subject to Section 11.01 and the
terms of the other Basic Documents, the Indenture Trustee shall
release property from the lien of this Indenture only upon receipt
of an Issuer Request accompanied by an Officer’s Certificate,
an Opinion of Counsel and (except in the case of a full redemption
under Section 10.01) Independent Certificates in accordance with
TIA §§ 314(c) and 314(d)(1) or an Opinion of Counsel in
lieu of such Independent Certificates to the effect that the TIA
does not require any such Independent Certificates.

 

Section 2.13.   Tax
Treatment; Tax Information .

 

(a)      The
Issuer has entered into this Indenture, and the Notes will be
issued (other than the Class A-1 Notes unless transferred in
accordance with Section 2.04A), with the intention that, for all
purposes including federal, state and local income, single business
and franchise tax purposes, the Notes will qualify as indebtedness
secured by the Owner Trust Estate. The Issuer, by entering into
this Indenture, and each Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note
(and each Note Owner by its acceptance of an interest in the
applicable Book-Entry Note), agree to treat the Notes (other than
the Class A-1 Notes unless transferred in accordance with Section
2.04A) for all purposes including federal, state and local income,
single business and franchise tax purposes as
indebtedness.

 

(b)      Each
Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note, and Note Owner, if
different, by its acceptance of a beneficial interest in a Note,
agrees to provide and shall provide to the person making payments
on the Note to it (or other person responsible for withholding of
taxes) with the Tax Information, and will update or replace such
Tax Information when it becomes incorrect or obsolete, at any time
required by applicable law or promptly upon request. Each
Noteholder and Note Owner is deemed to understand, acknowledge and
agree that the Indenture Trustee, Paying Agent and Issuer (or other
person responsible for withholding of taxes) have the right to
withhold on payments with respect to a Note (without any
corresponding gross-up) where an applicable party fails to comply
with the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence or the
Indenture Trustee, Paying Agent or Issuer (or other person
responsible for withholding of taxes) is otherwise required to so
withhold under applicable law.

Section 2.14.  
Employee Benefit Plans .  The transfer of a
Definitive Note shall not be registered unless the prospective
transferee (and if the transferee is a Plan, its fiduciary) has
represented in writing to the Indenture Trustee that either (i) it
is not acquiring such Note with the assets of a Benefit Plan
Investor or a Plan that is subject to Similar Law; or (ii) its
acquisition and holding of such Note will not give rise to, in the
case of a Benefit Plan Investor, a nonexempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, in the
case of a Plan that is subject to Similar Law, a violation of
Similar Law. Any Person that acquires a beneficial interest in a
Book Entry Note shall be deemed to make the same representations as
set forth above in this Section 2.14.

Issuer will cause to be distributed all amounts on deposit in the
Note Distribution Account on a Payment Date deposited therein in
accordance with Section 8.02(d). Amounts properly withheld under
the Code by any Person from a payment to any Noteholder of interest

Paul, Minnesota. The Issuer hereby initially appoints the Indenture
Trustee to serve as its agent for the foregoing purposes. The
Issuer will give prompt written notice to the Indenture Trustee of
the location, and of any change in the location, of any such office
or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any
such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Indenture
Trustee with the address thereof, such surrenders, notices and
demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office, and
the Issuer hereby appoints the Indenture Trustee as its agent to
receive all such surrenders, notices and demands, provided that the
Indenture Trustee shall not serve as an agent or office for the
purpose of service of process on behalf of the Issuer.

 

Section 3.03.   Money
for Payments to be Held in Trust .  As provided in
Sections 5.04 and 8.02, all payments of amounts due and payable
with respect to any Notes that are to be made from amounts

Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or by another Paying Agent, and no
amounts so withdrawn from the Collection Account and the Note
Distribution Account for payments of Notes shall be paid over to
the Issuer except as provided in this Section.
 

12



 

 

On or before the Business Day
immediately preceding each Payment Date and Redemption Date, the
Issuer shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the Collection
Account (to be transferred to the Note Distribution Account on the
related Payment Date) an aggregate sum sufficient to pay the
amounts then becoming due under the Notes, such sum to be held in
trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless
the Paying Agent is the Indenture Trustee) shall promptly notify
the Indenture Trustee in writing of its action or failure so to
act.

 

The Issuer will cause each Paying
Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent
shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture
Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees), subject to the
provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

 

(i)          hold
all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to
the Notes in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein provided and pay such sums to such Persons as herein
provided;

 

(ii)         give
the Indenture Trustee notice of any default by the Issuer (or any
other obligor upon the Notes) of which it has actual knowledge in
the making of any payment required to be made with respect to the
Notes;

 

(iii)        at
any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the
written request of the Indenture Trustee, forthwith pay to the
Indenture Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying
Agent;

 

(iv)        immediately
resign as a Paying Agent and forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee
all sums held by it in trust for the payment of Notes if at any
time it ceases to meet the standards required to be met by a Paying
Agent at the time of its appointment;

 

(v)         comply
with all requirements of the Code with respect to the withholding
from any payments made by it on any Notes of any applicable
withholding taxes imposed thereon (including obtaining and
retaining from Persons entitled to payments with respect to the
Notes any Tax Information and making any withholdings with respect
to the Notes as required by the Code and paying over such withheld
amounts to the appropriate governmental authority) and

 

(vi)        comply
with any applicable reporting requirements in connection with any
payments made by it on any Notes and any withholding of taxes
therefrom, and, upon request, provide any Tax Information to the
Issuer.

 

The Issuer may at any time, for the
purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer Order direct any
Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in trust
by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which the sums were held by such
Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such money.

 

13



 

 

Subject to applicable laws with
respect to escheat of funds, any money held by the Indenture
Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of any amount
due with respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such amount has become due and payable shall be discharged
from such trust and be paid to the Issuer on Issuer Request; and
the Noteholder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured
general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof (but
only to the extent of the amounts so paid to the Issuer), and all
liability of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money shall thereupon cease; provided,
however, that the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent, before
being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense and
written direction of the Issuer cause to be published once, in a
newspaper published in the English language, customarily published
on each Business Day and of general circulation in The City of New
York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a
date specified therein, which shall not be less than thirty (30)
days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of
such money then remaining will be repaid to or for the account of
the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee shall also adopt and employ, at
the expense and written direction of the Issuer, any other
reasonable means of notification of such repayment (including, but
not limited to, mailing notice of such repayment to Noteholders
whose Notes have been called but have not been surrendered for
redemption or whose right to or interest in monies due and payable
but not claimed is determinable from the records of the Indenture
Trustee or of any Paying Agent, at the last address of record for
each such Noteholder).

 

Section 3.04.  Existence
. The Issuer will keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of
Delaware (unless it becomes, or any successor Issuer hereunder is
or becomes, organized under the laws of any other State or of the
United States, in which case the Issuer will keep in full effect
its existence, rights and franchises under the laws of such other
jurisdiction) and will obtain and preserve its qualification to do
business in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is or
shall be necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of
this Indenture, the Notes, the Collateral and each other instrument
or agreement included in the Owner Trust Estate in connection with
this Agreement and the other Basic Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby until such time as the Issuer shall
terminate in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

Section 3.05.  Protection of
Owner Trust Estate . The Issuer intends the security interest
Granted pursuant to this Indenture in favor of the Indenture
Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders to be prior to all other liens
in respect of the Owner Trust Estate, and the Issuer shall take all
actions necessary to obtain and maintain, for the benefit of the
Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders, a first lien on and
a first priority, perfected security interest in the Owner Trust
Estate. The Issuer will from time to time execute and deliver all
such supplements and amendments hereto and all such financing
statements, continuation statements, instruments of further
assurance and other instruments, all as prepared by the
Administrator and delivered to the Issuer, and will take such other
action necessary or advisable to:

 

(i)          grant
more effectively any portion of the Owner Trust Estate;

 

(ii)         maintain
or preserve the lien and security interest (and the priority
thereof) created by this Indenture or carry out more effectively
the purposes hereof;

 

14



 

 

(iii)        perfect,
publish notice of or protect the validity of any Grant made or to

and defend title to the Owner Trust Estate and the rights of the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders in such Owner Trust Estate
against the claims of all persons and parties; or

 

(vi)        pay
all taxes or assessments levied or assessed upon the Owner Trust
Estate when due.

to Owner Trust Estate .

shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that, in the opinion of such counsel, either (i) all
financing statements and continuation statements have been executed
and filed that are necessary to create and continue the Indenture
Trustee’s first priority perfected security interest in the
collateral for the benefit of the Noteholders, and reciting the
details of such filings or referring to prior Opinions of Counsel
in which such details are given, or (ii) no such action shall be
necessary to perfect such security interest.

 

(b)          Within
ninety (90) days after the beginning of each fiscal year of the
Issuer (commencing with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017), the
Issuer shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel, dated as of a date during such 90-day period, to the
effect that, in the opinion of such counsel, either (i) all
financing statements and continuation statements have been executed
and filed that are necessary to create and continue the Indenture
Trustee’s first priority perfected security interest in the
collateral for the benefit of the Noteholders, and reciting the
details of such filings or referring to prior Opinions of Counsel
in which such details are given, or (ii) no such action shall be
necessary to perfect such security interest.

 

Section 3.07.  Performance
of Obligations; Servicing of Receivables .

 

(a)          The
Issuer will not take any action and will use its best efforts not
to permit any action to be taken by others that would release any
Person from any of such Person’s material covenants or
obligations under any instrument or agreement included in the Owner
Trust Estate or that would result in the amendment, hypothecation,
subordination, termination or discharge of, or impair the validity
or effectiveness of, any such instrument or agreement, except as
expressly provided in this Indenture, the other Basic Documents or
such other instrument or agreement.

 

(b)          The
Issuer may contract with other Persons to assist it in performing
its duties under this Indenture, and any performance of such duties
by a Person identified to the Indenture Trustee in an
Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be
action taken by the Issuer. Initially, the Issuer has contracted
with the Servicer and the Administrator to assist the Issuer in
performing its duties under this Indenture.

 

15



 

 

(c)          The
Issuer will and will cause the Administrator to, punctually perform
and observe all of its obligations and agreements contained in this
Indenture, the other Basic Documents and in the instruments and
agreements included in the Owner Trust Estate, including but not
limited to filing or causing to be filed all UCC financing
statements and continuation statements required to be filed by the
terms of this Indenture and the other Basic Documents in accordance
with and within the time periods provided for herein and therein.
Except as otherwise expressly provided therein, the Issuer shall
not waive, amend, modify, supplement or terminate any Basic
Document or any provision thereof without the written consent of
the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders of at least a majority of
the Outstanding Amount or such greater percentage as may be
specified in the particular provision.

 

(d)          If
the Issuer shall have knowledge of the occurrence of a Servicer
Default, the Issuer shall promptly provide written notice to a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee and to the
Administrator thereof, and shall specify in such notice the action,
if any, the Issuer is taking with respect of such default. If a
Servicer Default shall arise from the failure of the Servicer to
perform any of its duties or obligations under the Sale and
Servicing Agreement with respect to the Receivables, the Issuer
shall take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure. The Administrator shall, in accordance with Section
1.02(c) of the Administration Agreement, make such notice available
to each Rating Agency.

 

(e)          As
promptly as possible after the giving of notice of termination to
the Servicer of the Servicer’s rights and powers pursuant to
Section 7.01 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall
promptly notify a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee and
the Indenture Trustee shall appoint a Successor Servicer, and such
Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written
assumption in a form acceptable to the Indenture Trustee. In the
event that a Successor Servicer has not been appointed and accepted
its appointment at the time when the Servicer ceases to act as
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee without further action shall
automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer. The Indenture
Trustee may resign as the Servicer by giving written notice of such
resignation to the Issuer and in such event will be released from
such duties and obligations, such release not to be effective until
the date a new servicer enters into a servicing agreement as
provided below. Upon delivery of any such notice to the Issuer, the
Issuer shall obtain a new servicer as the Successor Servicer under
the Sale and Servicing Agreement. As soon as such a Successor
Servicer is appointed, the Issuer shall notify the Indenture
Trustee of such appointment, specifying in such notice the name and
address of such Successor Servicer. Any Successor Servicer other
than the Indenture Trustee shall (i) be an established financial
institution having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 and
whose regular business includes the servicing of motor vehicle
receivables and (ii) enter into a servicing agreement with the
Issuer and the Seller having substantially the same provisions as
the provisions of the Sale and Servicing Agreement applicable to
the Servicer. If within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
notice referred to above, the Issuer shall not have obtained such a
new servicer, the Indenture Trustee may appoint, or may petition a
court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a Successor Servicer.
In connection with any such appointment, the Issuer may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor as it and such
successor shall agree, subject to the limitations set forth below
and in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and in accordance with
Section 7.02 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer and
the Seller shall enter into an agreement with such successor for
the servicing of the Receivables (such agreement to be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee). If the Indenture
Trustee shall succeed to the Servicer’s duties as servicer of
the Receivables as provided herein, it shall do so in its
individual capacity and not in its capacity as Indenture Trustee
and, accordingly, the provisions of Article VI shall be
inapplicable (except as set forth in the proviso contained in
Section 6.01(a)) to the Indenture Trustee in its duties as the
successor to the Servicer and the servicing of the Receivables. In
case the Indenture Trustee shall become successor to the Servicer
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to appoint as Servicer any one of its Affiliates or
agents, provided that it shall be fully liable for the actions and
omissions of such Affiliate or agent in such capacity as Successor
Servicer.

sell, transfer, exchange or otherwise dispose of any of the
properties or assets of the Issuer, including those included in the

Trustee;

with respect to the Notes under this Indenture except as may be
expressly permitted hereby, (B) permit any lien, charge, excise,
claim, security interest, mortgage or other encumbrance (other than
the lien of this Indenture) to be created on or extend to or
otherwise arise upon or burden the Owner Trust Estate or any part
thereof or any interest therein or the proceeds thereof (other than
tax liens, mechanics’ liens and other liens that arise by
operation of law, in each case on any of the Financed Vehicles and
arising solely as a result of an action or omission of the related
Obligor) or (C) permit the lien created by this Indenture not to
constitute a valid first priority (other than with respect to any
such tax, mechanics’ or other lien) security interest in the
Owner Trust Estate; or

 

(iv)        dissolve
or liquidate in whole or in part.

Section 5.04.  Remedies,
Priorities .

 

(a)          If

under this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration
or otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained and collect from the

(iv)        sell
the Owner Trust Estate or any portion thereof or rights or interest
therein, at one or more public or private sales called and
conducted in any manner permitted by law;
 
provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee
may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Owner Trust Estate
following an Event of Default, unless (A) the Noteholders of 100%
of the Outstanding Amount consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such
sale or liquidation distributable to the Noteholders and
Certificateholders are sufficient to discharge in full all amounts
then due and unpaid upon such Notes and Certificates for principal
and interest or (C) the Indenture Trustee determines that the Owner
Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the
payment of principal of and interest on the Notes and Certificates
as would have become due if the Notes and Certificates had not been
declared due and payable, and the Indenture Trustee obtains the
consent of Noteholders of 100% of the Outstanding Amount. In
determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to
clause (B) and (C) above, the Indenture Trustee may, but need not,
obtain, at the expense of the Issuer, and rely upon an opinion of
an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national
reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to
the sufficiency of the Owner Trust Estate for such
purpose.

 

27



 

 

(b)          If
the Indenture Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to
this Article, it shall pay out the money or property in the

Preservation of the Receivables . If the Notes have been
declared to be due and payable under Section 5.02 following an
Event of Default and such declaration and its consequences have not

the desire of the parties hereto and the Noteholders that there be
at all times sufficient funds for the payment of any principal of
and interest on the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take
such desire into account when determining whether or not to
maintain possession of the Owner Trust Estate. In determining
whether to maintain possession of the Owner Trust Estate, the
Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain, at the expense of the
Issuer, and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment
banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of
the Owner Trust Estate for such purpose.

the Indenture Trustee during such 60-day period by the Noteholders
of a majority of the Outstanding Amount.

more Noteholders shall have any right in any manner whatever by
virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to
affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Noteholders or
to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other Noteholders or to enforce any right under this Indenture,
except in the manner herein provided.
 
In the event the Indenture Trustee shall receive
conflicting or inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or more
groups of Noteholders, each representing less than a majority of
the Outstanding Amount, the Indenture Trustee in its sole
discretion may determine what action, if any, shall be taken,
notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture. The
Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any such determination
made in good faith.

redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not
be impaired without the consent of such Noteholder.

 

29



 

 

Section 5.08.  Restoration
of Rights and Remedies . If the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined
adversely to the Indenture Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and
in every such case the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding,
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.

Remedies Cumulative . No right or remedy herein conferred upon
or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or to the Noteholders is
intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion
or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

 

Section 5.10.  Delay or
Omission Not a Waiver . No delay or omission of the Indenture
Trustee or any Noteholder of any Note to exercise any right or
remedy accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair

remedy given by this Article or by law to the Indenture Trustee or
to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often
as may be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or by the
Noteholders, as the case may be.

 

Section 5.11.  Control by
Noteholders . The Noteholders of Notes representing a majority
of the Outstanding Amount shall have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy
available to the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee;
provided that:

 

(i)          such
direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with
this Indenture;

 

(ii)         subject
to the terms of Section 5.04, any direction to the Indenture
Trustee to sell or liquidate the Owner Trust Estate shall be by the
Noteholders of Notes representing not less than 100% of the
Outstanding Amount;

 

(iii)        if
the conditions set forth in Section 5.05 have been satisfied and
the Indenture Trustee elects to retain the Owner Trust Estate
pursuant to such Section, then any direction to the Indenture
Trustee by the Noteholders of Notes representing less than 100% of
the Outstanding Amount to sell or liquidate the Owner Trust Estate
shall be of no force and effect; and

 

(iv)        the
Indenture Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Indenture Trustee that is not inconsistent with such
direction.
 
Notwithstanding the rights of Noteholders set
forth in this Section, subject to Section 6.01, the Indenture
Trustee need not take any action for which it will not be
adequately indemnified or might materially adversely affect the
rights of any Noteholders not consenting to such action.

Section 5.12.   Waiver of
Past Defaults . Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of
the maturity of the Notes as provided in Section 5.02, the
Noteholders of Notes of not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Amount may waive any past Default or Event of Default and its
consequences except a Default (i) in payment of principal of or
interest on any of the Notes or (ii) in respect of a covenant or
provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of each Noteholder. In the case of any such waiver, the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders shall
respectively be restored to their former positions and rights
hereunder; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent
thereto. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist
and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been
cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of this
Indenture.

 

Section 5.13.  Undertaking
for Costs . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each
Noteholder by such Noteholder’s acceptance thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion
require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture Trustee
for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture
Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may
in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and reasonable expenses, against any party
litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good
faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but
the provisions of this Section shall not apply to (i) any suit
instituted by the Indenture Trustee, (ii) any suit instituted by
any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, in each case holding in
the aggregate more than 10% of the Outstanding Amount or (iii) any
suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the
payment of principal of or interest on any Note on or after the
respective due dates expressed in such Note and in this Indenture
(or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption
Date).

 

Section 5.14.  Waiver of
Stay or Extension Laws . The Issuer covenants (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist
upon, or plead or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the
benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to
the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all
benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will
not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted to the Indenture Trustee, but will suffer and permit the
execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.

 

Section 5.15.  Action on
Notes . The Indenture Trustee’s right to seek and recover
judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be affected
by the seeking, obtaining or application of any other relief under
or with respect to this Indenture. Neither the lien of this
Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Indenture Trustee or
the Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment
by the Indenture Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any
execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Owner Trust
Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer. Any money or
property collected by the Indenture Trustee shall be applied in
accordance with Section 5.04(b).

Section 5.16.  Performance
and Enforcement of Certain Obligations .

 

(a)          Promptly
following a request from the Indenture Trustee to do so and at the
Administrator’s expense, the Issuer shall take all such
lawful action as the Indenture Trustee may request to compel or
secure the performance and observance by the Seller or the
Servicer, as applicable, of each of their obligations to the Issuer
under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof, and to exercise any and all
rights, remedies, powers and privileges lawfully available to the
Issuer under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement
to the extent and in the manner directed by the Indenture Trustee,
including the transmission of notices of default on the part of the
Seller or the Servicer thereunder and the institution of legal or
administrative actions or proceedings to compel or secure
performance by the Seller or the Servicer of each of their
obligations under the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

 

(b)          If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture
Trustee may, and at the direction (which direction shall be in
writing) of the Noteholders of at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding
Amount shall, exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and
claims of the Issuer against the Seller or the Servicer under or in
connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement, including the
right or power to take any action to compel or secure performance
or observance by the Seller or the Servicer, as applicable, of each
of their obligations to the Issuer thereunder and to give any
consent, request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, as applicable, and any
right of the Issuer to take such action shall be
suspended.
 
ARTICLE VI


THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

 

Section 6.01.  Duties of
Indenture Trustee .

 

(a)          If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee has actual knowledge,
the Indenture Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested
in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill
in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under
the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own
affairs; provided, however, that if the Indenture Trustee shall
assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section 3.07(e), the
Indenture Trustee in performing such duties shall use the degree of
care and skill customarily exercised by a prudent institutional
servicer with respect to installment sale contracts that it
services for itself or others.

 

(b)          Except
during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee has actual
knowledge:

 

(i)          the
Indenture Trustee shall undertake to perform such duties and only
such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture
against the Indenture Trustee; and

 

32



 

 

(ii)         in
the absence of bad faith on its part, the Indenture Trustee may
conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or
opinions furnished to the Indenture Trustee and conforming to the
requirements of this Indenture; however, the Indenture Trustee
shall examine the certificates and opinions specifically required
to be furnished pursuant to any provision of this Agreement to
determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
Indenture.

 

(c)          The
Indenture Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own
willful misconduct, except that:

 

(i)          this
paragraph does not limit the effect of Section 6.01(b);

 

(ii)         the
Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment
made in good faith by a Responsible Officer unless it is proved
that the Indenture Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the
pertinent facts; and

 

(iii)        the
Indenture Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it
takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction
received by it pursuant to Section 5.11.

 

(d)          Every
provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the
Indenture Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this
Section.

 

(e)          The
Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money
received by it except as the Indenture Trustee may agree in writing
with the Issuer.

 

(f)          Money
held in trust by the Indenture Trustee need not be segregated from
other funds except to the extent required by law or the terms of
this Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

 

(g)          No
provision of this Indenture shall require the Indenture Trustee to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability
in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the
exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have
reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or
adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it.

 

(h)          Every
provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting
the liability of or affording protection to the Indenture Trustee
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section and to the
provisions of the TIA.

 

(i)          The
Indenture Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Event
of Default or any breach of a representation or warranty, as made
in the Receivables Purchase Agreement, unless either (i) a
Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge of such Event of
Default or breach, as applicable, or (ii) written notice of such
Event of Default, or breach, as applicable, shall have been
received by a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee in
accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. The receipt by
the Indenture Trustee of a Review Report shall not obligate the
Indenture Trustee to exercise its rights to enforce repurchase
obligations under the Receivables Purchase Agreement unless the
Indenture Trustee is directed to do so by a Noteholder or Note
Owner.
