History[edit]




Framed photograph of Douglas C. Strain, on the wall of the science center named after him at Pacific University


ESI was founded in 1944[3] as Brown Engineering, later becoming Brown Electro-Measurement Corporation (BECO).[8] In 1953, BECO's Douglas C. Strain and three other investors bought out Strain's partners at Brown and formed a new company, Electro-Measurements Inc., which used the brand name "ESI" in marketing. The acronym stood for "excellent scientific instruments",[9] but the company's name remained Electro Measurements Inc. until 1959, when it was changed to "ESI, Inc." and finally in 1960 to Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI).[10] Prior to about 2000, the company was usually referred to as having been founded in 1953.[1][2][11][12] Douglas Strain was the company's CEO and board chairman from 1953 until 1980 and remained on the board (continuing as chairman until 1985, then vice chairman) until fully retiring in 1999.[12]
In the 1950s, the company's specialty was the manufacture of high-precision resistance measuring instruments and related products.[2] In 1970, ESI began developing laser trimming systems for resistor circuits,[2] and soon became a leader in this field.




ESI's headquarters campus building 4


All facilities were located at S.E. 43rd & Stark in Portland until 1956, when the first stage of a new headquarters and manufacturing plant on Macadam Avenue, in South Portland, was opened. The new plant was destroyed by fire[8] in 1957[13] and had to be rebuilt. In 1962, ESI announced plans to create a new development called "Sunset Science Park", to be built in the Cedar Mill area of unincorporated Washington County, Oregon, designed to attract other technology companies, with ESI as an anchor.[14] The company moved its headquarters to the Sunset Science Park location in 1963, and the manufacturing facilities followed in 1966, vacating the Macadam Avenue site. The complex on N.W. Science Park Drive, which remains ESI's headquarters today, has a Portland mailing address, but is not in the city of Portland proper; it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of Beaverton.
ESI became a publicly traded company in 1983.[2][15] The company opened its first foreign sales office in 1978, in Munich, Germany, and later opened offices in several countries in Southeast Asia.[16] The company now has offices for direct sales in several European countries, as well.[17]
Several small companies were acquired by ESI in the late 1990s, including Dynamotion Corp. (of California) in 1997,[18] Chip Star Inc. (California) in 1997,[19] Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) (Michigan) in 1997[20] and Testec Corp. (Arizona) in 1999.[21]
A new manufacturing facility was opened in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in early 2001.[22] The company acquired California-based New Wave Research Inc. in 2007.[23] At the beginning of 2009, Electro Scientific had around 700 employees, about half of whom were located in Oregon.[5] Edward C. Grady was named as the president and CEO of ESI in February 2014.[24]
The company acquired fiber laser manufacturer Eolite Systems in June 2012,[25] the semiconductor systems business from GSI Group in May 2013,[26] and Chinese laser firm Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co. in January 2015.[27]
In August 2016, the company announced that Michael Burger, formerly CEO of Cascade Microtech, would succeed Edward Grady as CEO effective October 3, 2016.[28]
Annexation fight[edit]
In 2005, ESI joined Columbia Sportswear, Tektronix and other Washington County companies in an effort led by Nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of "islands" of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city.[29] The Nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of Beaverton in 2004, under which the city had added more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) of unincorporated land, including the headquarters of Leupold & Stevens[30] (located almost adjacent to ESI, but on the opposite side of the Sunset Highway freeway). Although the headquarters of ESI and Columbia are not on "islands" surrounded by Beaverton, both directly abut the city boundary, and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the city's annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island. The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property—whether an island or not—for at least 30 years.[31][32]
Operations[edit]
ESI manufactures a variety of laser-based processing and micro-manufacturing solutions designed to help manufacturers optimize their production capabilities by moving beyond the limitations of mechanical-based solutions. These include laser-based via drilling systems for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers and integrated circuit packaging fabricators. ESI systems also address the needs of passive component manufacturing/testing/inspection with wafer trim and circuit trim offerings. Semiconductor manufacturers use ESI systems for processing wafers. Manufacturers use ESI’s laser-based micro-machining platforms for component part manufacturing and marking.
ESI’s manufacturing facilities are distributed across the US and Asia, from the headquarters campus in Portland, to Klamath Falls, Oregon, Fremont, California, Bozeman, Montana and Singapore. In Asia, the primary operation hub is located in Shanghai.
The NASDAQ-traded company had annual revenues of $159.1 million for fiscal year 2015.[33]
Products[edit]
ESI’s interconnect and micro-fabrication products are used to create nano-scale features on a variety of materials and substrates in high-volume manufacturing. The company’s semiconductor products include automated ultra-thin wafer dicing and high-throughput, high-accuracy grooving systems.[34] In the area of component test and inspection, ESI offers automated test, termination, high-speed handling and visual inspection equipment for manufacturing of miniature multilayer ceramic passive components and other components, such as arrays, inductors and varistors. It also manufactures fiber, rod and solid state lasers and ablation lasers for use in laser manufacturing systems.

The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property—whether an island or not—for at least 30 years.[31][32]
Operations[edit]
ESI manufactures a variety of laser-based processing and micro-manufacturing solutions designed to help manufacturers optimize their production capabilities by moving beyond the limitations of mechanical-based solutions. These include laser-based via drilling systems for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers and integrated circuit packaging fabricators. ESI systems also address the needs of passive component manufacturing/testing/inspection with wafer trim and circuit trim offerings. Semiconductor manufacturers use ESI systems for processing wafers. Manufacturers use ESI’s laser-based micro-machining platforms for component part manufacturing and marking.
ESI’s manufacturing facilities are distributed across the US and Asia, from the headquarters campus in Portland, to Klamath Falls, Oregon, Fremont, California, Bozeman, Montana and Singapore. In Asia, the primary operation hub is located in Shanghai.
The NASDAQ-traded company had annual revenues of $159.1 million for fiscal year 2015.[33]
Products[edit]
ESI’s interconnect and micro-fabrication products are used to create nano-scale features on a variety of materials and substrates in high-volume manufacturing. The company’s semiconductor products include automated ultra-thin wafer dicing and high-throughput, high-accuracy grooving systems.[34] In the area of component test and inspection, ESI offers automated test, termination, high-speed handling and visual inspection equipment for manufacturing of miniature multilayer ceramic passive components and other components, such as arrays, inductors and varistors. It also manufactures fiber, rod and solid state lasers and ablation lasers for use in laser manufacturing systems.

History[edit]




Framed photograph of Douglas C. Strain, on the wall of the science center named after him at Pacific University


ESI was founded in 1944[3] as Brown Engineering, later becoming Brown Electro-Measurement Corporation (BECO).[8] In 1953, BECO's Douglas C. Strain and three other investors bought out Strain's partners at Brown and formed a new company, Electro-Measurements Inc., which used the brand name "ESI" in marketing. The acronym stood for "excellent scientific instruments",[9] but the company's name remained Electro Measurements Inc. until 1959, when it was changed to "ESI, Inc." and finally in 1960 to Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI).[10] Prior to about 2000, the company was usually referred to as having been founded in 1953.[1][2][11][12] Douglas Strain was the company's CEO and board chairman from 1953 until 1980 and remained on the board (continuing as chairman until 1985, then vice chairman) until fully retiring in 1999.[12]
In the 1950s, the company's specialty was the manufacture of high-precision resistance measuring instruments and related products.[2] In 1970, ESI began developing laser trimming systems for resistor circuits,[2] and soon became a leader in this field.




ESI's headquarters campus building 4


All facilities were located at S.E. 43rd & Stark in Portland until 1956, when the first stage of a new headquarters and manufacturing plant on Macadam Avenue, in South Portland, was opened. The new plant was destroyed by fire[8] in 1957[13] and had to be rebuilt. In 1962, ESI announced plans to create a new development called "Sunset Science Park", to be built in the Cedar Mill area of unincorporated Washington County, Oregon, designed to attract other technology companies, with ESI as an anchor.[14] The company moved its headquarters to the Sunset Science Park location in 1963, and the manufacturing facilities followed in 1966, vacating the Macadam Avenue site. The complex on N.W. Science Park Drive, which remains ESI's headquarters today, has a Portland mailing address, but is not in the city of Portland proper; it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of Beaverton.
ESI became a publicly traded company in 1983.[2][15] The company opened its first foreign sales office in 1978, in Munich, Germany, and later opened offices in several countries in Southeast Asia.[16] The company now has offices for direct sales in several European countries, as well.[17]
Several small companies were acquired by ESI in the late 1990s, including Dynamotion Corp. (of California) in 1997,[18] Chip Star Inc. (California) in 1997,[19] Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) (Michigan) in 1997[20] and Testec Corp. (Arizona) in 1999.[21]
A new manufacturing facility was opened in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in early 2001.[22] The company acquired California-based New Wave Research Inc. in 2007.[23] At the beginning of 2009, Electro Scientific had around 700 employees, about half of whom were located in Oregon.[5] Edward C. Grady was named as the president and CEO of ESI in February 2014.[24]
The company acquired fiber laser manufacturer Eolite Systems in June 2012,[25] the semiconductor systems business from GSI Group in May 2013,[26] and Chinese laser firm Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co. in January 2015.[27]
In August 2016, the company announced that Michael Burger, formerly CEO of Cascade Microtech, would succeed Edward Grady as CEO effective October 3, 2016.[28]
Annexation fight[edit]
In 2005, ESI joined Columbia Sportswear, Tektronix and other Washington County companies in an effort led by Nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of "islands" of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city.[29] The Nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of Beaverton in 2004, under which the city had added more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) of unincorporated land, including the headquarters of Leupold & Stevens[30] (located almost adjacent to ESI, but on the opposite side of the Sunset Highway freeway). Although the headquarters of ESI and Columbia are not on "islands" surrounded by Beaverton, both directly abut the city boundary, and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the city's annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island. The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property—whether an island or not—for at least 30 years.[31][32]

The NASDAQ-traded company had annual revenues of $159.1 million for fiscal year 2015.[33]
Products[edit]
ESI’s interconnect and micro-fabrication products are used to create nano-scale features on a variety of materials and substrates in high-volume manufacturing. The company’s semiconductor products include automated ultra-thin wafer dicing and high-throughput, high-accuracy grooving systems.[34] In the area of component test and inspection, ESI offers automated test, termination, high-speed handling and visual inspection equipment for manufacturing of miniature multilayer ceramic passive components and other components, such as arrays, inductors and varistors. It also manufactures fiber, rod and solid state lasers and ablation lasers for use in laser manufacturing systems.

The complex on N.W. Science Park Drive, which remains ESI's headquarters today, has a Portland mailing address, but is not in the city of Portland proper; it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of Beaverton.
ESI became a publicly traded company in 1983.[2][15] The company opened its first foreign sales office in 1978, in Munich, Germany, and later opened offices in several countries in Southeast Asia.[16] The company now has offices for direct sales in several European countries, as well.[17]
Several small companies were acquired by ESI in the late 1990s, including Dynamotion Corp. (of California) in 1997,[18] Chip Star Inc. (California) in 1997,[19] Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) (Michigan) in 1997[20] and Testec Corp. (Arizona) in 1999.[21]
A new manufacturing facility was opened in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in early 2001.[22] The company acquired California-based New Wave Research Inc. in 2007.[23] At the beginning of 2009, Electro Scientific had around 700 employees, about half of whom were located in Oregon.[5] Edward C. Grady was named as the president and CEO of ESI in February 2014.[24]
The company acquired fiber laser manufacturer Eolite Systems in June 2012,[25] the semiconductor systems business from GSI Group in May 2013,[26] and Chinese laser firm Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co. in January 2015.[27]
In August 2016, the company announced that Michael Burger, formerly CEO of Cascade Microtech, would succeed Edward Grady as CEO effective October 3, 2016.[28]
Annexation fight[edit]
In 2005, ESI joined Columbia Sportswear, Tektronix and other Washington County companies in an effort led by Nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of "islands" of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city.[29] The Nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of Beaverton in 2004, under which the city had added more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) of unincorporated land, including the headquarters of Leupold & Stevens[30] (located almost adjacent to ESI, but on the opposite side of the Sunset Highway freeway). Although the headquarters of ESI and Columbia are not on "islands" surrounded by Beaverton, both directly abut the city boundary, and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the city's annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island. The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property—whether an island or not—for at least 30 years.[31][32]
Operations[edit]
ESI manufactures a variety of laser-based processing and micro-manufacturing solutions designed to help manufacturers optimize their production capabilities by moving beyond the limitations of mechanical-based solutions. These include laser-based via drilling systems for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers and integrated circuit packaging fabricators. ESI systems also address the needs of passive component manufacturing/testing/inspection with wafer trim and circuit trim offerings. Semiconductor manufacturers use ESI systems for processing wafers. Manufacturers use ESI’s laser-based micro-machining platforms for component part manufacturing and marking.
ESI’s manufacturing facilities are distributed across the US and Asia, from the headquarters campus in Portland, to Klamath Falls, Oregon, Fremont, California, Bozeman, Montana and Singapore. In Asia, the primary operation hub is located in Shanghai.
The NASDAQ-traded company had annual revenues of $159.1 million for fiscal year 2015.[33]
Products[edit]
ESI’s interconnect and micro-fabrication products are used to create nano-scale features on a variety of materials and substrates in high-volume manufacturing. The company’s semiconductor products include automated ultra-thin wafer dicing and high-throughput, high-accuracy grooving systems.[34] In the area of component test and inspection, ESI offers automated test, termination, high-speed handling and visual inspection equipment for manufacturing of miniature multilayer ceramic passive components and other components, such as arrays, inductors and varistors. It also manufactures fiber, rod and solid state lasers and ablation lasers for use in laser manufacturing systems.

History[edit]




Framed photograph of Douglas C. Strain, on the wall of the science center named after him at Pacific University


ESI was founded in 1944[3] as Brown Engineering, later becoming Brown Electro-Measurement Corporation (BECO).[8] In 1953, BECO's Douglas C. Strain and three other investors bought out Strain's partners at Brown and formed a new company, Electro-Measurements Inc., which used the brand name "ESI" in marketing. The acronym stood for "excellent scientific instruments",[9] but the company's name remained Electro Measurements Inc. until 1959, when it was changed to "ESI, Inc." and finally in 1960 to Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI).[10] Prior to about 2000, the company was usually referred to as having been founded in 1953.[1][2][11][12] Douglas Strain was the company's CEO and board chairman from 1953 until 1980 and remained on the board (continuing as chairman until 1985, then vice chairman) until fully retiring in 1999.[12]
In the 1950s, the company's specialty was the manufacture of high-precision resistance measuring instruments and related products.[2] In 1970, ESI began developing laser trimming systems for resistor circuits,[2] and soon became a leader in this field.




ESI's headquarters campus building 4


All facilities were located at S.E. 43rd & Stark in Portland until 1956, when the first stage of a new headquarters and manufacturing plant on Macadam Avenue, in South Portland, was opened. The new plant was destroyed by fire[8] in 1957[13] and had to be rebuilt. In 1962, ESI announced plans to create a new development called "Sunset Science Park", to be built in the Cedar Mill area of unincorporated Washington County, Oregon, designed to attract other technology companies, with ESI as an anchor.[14] The company moved its headquarters to the Sunset Science Park location in 1963, and the manufacturing facilities followed in 1966, vacating the Macadam Avenue site. The complex on N.W. Science Park Drive, which remains ESI's headquarters today, has a Portland mailing address, but is not in the city of Portland proper; it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of Beaverton.
ESI became a publicly traded company in 1983.[2][15] The company opened its first foreign sales office in 1978, in Munich, Germany, and later opened offices in several countries in Southeast Asia.[16] The company now has offices for direct sales in several European countries, as well.[17]
Several small companies were acquired by ESI in the late 1990s, including Dynamotion Corp. (of California) in 1997,[18] Chip Star Inc. (California) in 1997,[19] Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) (Michigan) in 1997[20] and Testec Corp. (Arizona) in 1999.[21]
A new manufacturing facility was opened in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in early 2001.[22] The company acquired California-based New Wave Research Inc. in 2007.[23] At the beginning of 2009, Electro Scientific had around 700 employees, about half of whom were located in Oregon.[5] Edward C. Grady was named as the president and CEO of ESI in February 2014.[24]
The company acquired fiber laser manufacturer Eolite Systems in June 2012,[25] the semiconductor systems business from GSI Group in May 2013,[26] and Chinese laser firm Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co. in January 2015.[27]
In August 2016, the company announced that Michael Burger, formerly CEO of Cascade Microtech, would succeed Edward Grady as CEO effective October 3, 2016.[28]
Annexation fight[edit]
In 2005, ESI joined Columbia Sportswear, Tektronix and other Washington County companies in an effort led by Nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of "islands" of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city.[29] The Nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of Beaverton in 2004, under which the city had added more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) of unincorporated land, including the headquarters of Leupold & Stevens[30] (located almost adjacent to ESI, but on the opposite side of the Sunset Highway freeway). Although the headquarters of ESI and Columbia are not on "islands" surrounded by Beaverton, both directly abut the city boundary, and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the city's annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island. The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property—whether an island or not—for at least 30 years.[31][32]

The NASDAQ-traded company had annual revenues of $159.1 million for fiscal year 2015.[33]

ESI’s interconnect and micro-fabrication products are used to create nano-scale features on a variety of materials and substrates in high-volume manufacturing. The company’s semiconductor products include automated ultra-thin wafer dicing and high-throughput, high-accuracy grooving systems.[34] In the area of component test and inspection, ESI offers automated test, termination, high-speed handling and visual inspection equipment for manufacturing of miniature multilayer ceramic passive components and other components, such as arrays, inductors and varistors. It also manufactures fiber, rod and solid state lasers and ablation lasers for use in laser manufacturing systems.

History[edit]

ESI was founded in 1944[3] as Brown Engineering, later becoming Brown Electro-Measurement Corporation (BECO).[8] In 1953, BECO's Douglas C. Strain and three other investors bought out Strain's partners at Brown and formed a new company, Electro-Measurements Inc., which used the brand name "ESI" in marketing. The acronym stood for "excellent scientific instruments",[9] but the company's name remained Electro Measurements Inc. until 1959, when it was changed to "ESI, Inc." and finally in 1960 to Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI).[10] Prior to about 2000, the company was usually referred to as having been founded in 1953.[1][2][11][12] Douglas Strain was the company's CEO and board chairman from 1953 until 1980 and remained on the board (continuing as chairman until 1985, then vice chairman) until fully retiring in 1999.[12]
In the 1950s, the company's specialty was the manufacture of high-precision resistance measuring instruments and related products.[2] In 1970, ESI began developing laser trimming systems for resistor circuits,[2] and soon became a leader in this field.




ESI's headquarters campus building 4


All facilities were located at S.E. 43rd & Stark in Portland until 1956, when the first stage of a new headquarters and manufacturing plant on Macadam Avenue, in South Portland, was opened. The new plant was destroyed by fire[8] in 1957[13] and had to be rebuilt. In 1962, ESI announced plans to create a new development called "Sunset Science Park", to be built in the Cedar Mill area of unincorporated Washington County, Oregon, designed to attract other technology companies, with ESI as an anchor.[14] The company moved its headquarters to the Sunset Science Park location in 1963, and the manufacturing facilities followed in 1966, vacating the Macadam Avenue site. The complex on N.W. Science Park Drive, which remains ESI's headquarters today, has a Portland mailing address, but is not in the city of Portland proper; it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of Beaverton.
ESI became a publicly traded company in 1983.[2][15] The company opened its first foreign sales office in 1978, in Munich, Germany, and later opened offices in several countries in Southeast Asia.[16] The company now has offices for direct sales in several European countries, as well.[17]
Several small companies were acquired by ESI in the late 1990s, including Dynamotion Corp. (of California) in 1997,[18] Chip Star Inc. (California) in 1997,[19] Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) (Michigan) in 1997[20] and Testec Corp. (Arizona) in 1999.[21]
A new manufacturing facility was opened in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in early 2001.[22] The company acquired California-based New Wave Research Inc. in 2007.[23] At the beginning of 2009, Electro Scientific had around 700 employees, about half of whom were located in Oregon.[5] Edward C. Grady was named as the president and CEO of ESI in February 2014.[24]
The company acquired fiber laser manufacturer Eolite Systems in June 2012,[25] the semiconductor systems business from GSI Group in May 2013,[26] and Chinese laser firm Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co. in January 2015.[27]
In August 2016, the company announced that Michael Burger, formerly CEO of Cascade Microtech, would succeed Edward Grady as CEO effective October 3, 2016.[28]
Annexation fight[edit]
In 2005, ESI joined Columbia Sportswear, Tektronix and other Washington County companies in an effort led by Nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of "islands" of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city.[29] The Nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of Beaverton in 2004, under which the city had added more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) of unincorporated land, including the headquarters of Leupold & Stevens[30] (located almost adjacent to ESI, but on the opposite side of the Sunset Highway freeway). Although the headquarters of ESI and Columbia are not on "islands" surrounded by Beaverton, both directly abut the city boundary, and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the city's annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island. The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property—whether an island or not—for at least 30 years.[31][32]
Operations[edit]
ESI manufactures a variety of laser-based processing and micro-manufacturing solutions designed to help manufacturers optimize their production capabilities by moving beyond the limitations of mechanical-based solutions. These include laser-based via drilling systems for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers and integrated circuit packaging fabricators. ESI systems also address the needs of passive component manufacturing/testing/inspection with wafer trim and circuit trim offerings. Semiconductor manufacturers use ESI systems for processing wafers. Manufacturers use ESI’s laser-based micro-machining platforms for component part manufacturing and marking.
ESI’s manufacturing facilities are distributed across the US and Asia, from the headquarters campus in Portland, to Klamath Falls, Oregon, Fremont, California, Bozeman, Montana and Singapore. In Asia, the primary operation hub is located in Shanghai.
The NASDAQ-traded company had annual revenues of $159.1 million for fiscal year 2015.[33]
Products[edit]
ESI’s interconnect and micro-fabrication products are used to create nano-scale features on a variety of materials and substrates in high-volume manufacturing. The company’s semiconductor products include automated ultra-thin wafer dicing and high-throughput, high-accuracy grooving systems.[34] In the area of component test and inspection, ESI offers automated test, termination, high-speed handling and visual inspection equipment for manufacturing of miniature multilayer ceramic passive components and other components, such as arrays, inductors and varistors. It also manufactures fiber, rod and solid state lasers and ablation lasers for use in laser manufacturing systems.

					Full Description



Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI), incorporated on April 19, 1949, and its subsidiaries, supply laser-based manufacturing solutions for industries reliant on microtechnologies. The Company operates through two segments: Component Processing and Micromachining. The Component Processing segment includes interconnect products, semiconductor products and component products, which are sold to manufacturers of electronic components and are used to drill, cut, trim, ablate and test and mark features for the functionality of the component. The Micromachining segment includes products that are sold to manufacturers of end devices across various industries and are used to drill, cut or mark features on a range of materials, generally on the casing or external surface of the end device. The Company's integrated solutions allow industrial designers and process engineers to control the power of laser light to transform materials. The Company has operations and subsidiaries in Asia, Europe and North America.Laser microfabrication consists of a set of precise micron-level processes, including drilling, scribing, dicing, singulation, cutting, ablating, trimming, and precision marking on multiple types of materials. Its laser-based systems are utilized in the production of consumer electronics, printed circuit boards (PCBs), semiconductor devices, semiconductor packaging, electronic sensors, touch-panel glass, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and other components and devices. Additionally, it produces test and inspection equipment for quality control process during the production of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs).The Company's core competencies enable it to design, manufacture and market a range of integrated laser-based solutions for microfabrication applications. Its customers manufacture components, interconnect/packaging devices, semiconductors, displays or other parts that serve a range of electronic applications. Its systems enable the manufacturing of these components and devices. The primary end-market applications for its customers are consumer electronics, including smart mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, computers and semiconductors. These devices and applications are also utilized in a range of other industries, including automotive, aerospace, medical, security and general lighting.Component ProcessingThe Company's laser systems for interconnect products address applications and materials on a set of substrates, panels and continuous-feed reels for the PCB, packaging and display industries. The Company's lasers via drilling systems target electrical interconnect applications that require the accuracy and small via (hole) dimensions to create electrical connections between layers in circuits, circuit boards and integrated circuit (IC) packages. The Company's micro via drilling technology addresses the changing applications in IC packages, multichip modules and high density interconnect (HDI) circuit boards. Its ultraviolet (UV) laser processing systems employ technology in lasers, optics and motion control. Its products include single-beam and multi-beam systems. These same technologies can be used to singulate individual PCB (depaneling), rout copper openings on PCB material, cut circuit material, and mark individual packages or circuit boards.The Company's semiconductor manufacturing products address applications that utilize laser energy to process materials on wafer-based substrates and semiconductor devices and packages. Its applications include processing of silicon wafers, mixed signal devices, hybrid circuits, sensors and resistors. Semiconductor systems include wafer marking equipment, wafer and circuit trim tools, and LCD repair tools. Wafer marking equipment is used for serialization and wafer identification by both manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and within semiconductor fabrications. The Company's model 9900 uses a laser to dice ultra-thin silicon wafers, those with a thickness of 50 microns or below, and to singulate interposers. Its Ultrus is based on the 9900 platform that can scribe thin film materials that lend themselves to laser processing. Its laser systems are primarily sold to the manufacturers of LCD and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) repair tools as a component of their products.The Company's component manufacturing products combine small parts handling technology with real-time control systems to provide automated inspection solutions for manufacturers of multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) and other passive components, such as capacitor arrays, inductors, resistors, varistors and hybrid circuits. These components, produced in quantities of trillions of units per year, process analog, digital and high-frequency signals and are used in all electronic products. The MLCC test systems employ handling and positioning techniques to load, test and sort MLCCs based on their electrical energy storage capacity and their electrical energy leakage. Its 3510 model enables testing of the industry's 0402 capacitors used in cell phone and tablet designs. The Company also produces consumable products, such as carrier plates and termination belts, both of which are used to hold MLCCs during the manufacturing and testing process.The Company competes with Via Mechanics, Ltd., EO Technics Co. Ltd., LPKF Laser & Electronics AG, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Orbotech Ltd., InnoLas Systems GmbH, DISCO Corporation, Laser Solutions, Inc., Quantel USA, Inc., HOYA Corporation and Humo Laboratory Ltd.MicromachiningThe Company's micromachining products consist of laser systems that are used by manufacturers of end devices across various industries to drill, cut or mark features on a range of materials, generally on the casing or external surface of the end device. The Company offers various platforms that enable customers to perform precision drilling, scribing, cutting, etching, routing or marking on different types of materials and devices, including glass, metal, plastic, paint and ceramics. It also offers laser products for integration into customers' tools or process that are useful for applications, such as thin film processing, glass processing, material trimming, precision drilling, and organic and metal cutting.The Company's subsidiary, Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. (Topwin), is a laser system design and manufacturing company. The Company's Jade and Garnet platforms, which incorporate ESI laser technology and software controls on top of base platforms originally designed by Topwin, address various applications requiring mid-range performance, particularly in China. .

History[edit]




Framed photograph of Douglas C. Strain, on the wall of the science center named after him at Pacific University


ESI was founded in 1944[3] as Brown Engineering, later becoming Brown Electro-Measurement Corporation (BECO).[8] In 1953, BECO's Douglas C. Strain and three other investors bought out Strain's partners at Brown and formed a new company, Electro-Measurements Inc., which used the brand name "ESI" in marketing. The acronym stood for "excellent scientific instruments",[9] but the company's name remained Electro Measurements Inc. until 1959, when it was changed to "ESI, Inc." and finally in 1960 to Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI).[10] Prior to about 2000, the company was usually referred to as having been founded in 1953.[1][2][11][12] Douglas Strain was the company's CEO and board chairman from 1953 until 1980 and remained on the board (continuing as chairman until 1985, then vice chairman) until fully retiring in 1999.[12]
In the 1950s, the company's specialty was the manufacture of high-precision resistance measuring instruments and related products.[2] In 1970, ESI began developing laser trimming systems for resistor circuits,[2] and soon became a leader in this field.




ESI's headquarters campus building 4


All facilities were located at S.E. 43rd & Stark in Portland until 1956, when the first stage of a new headquarters and manufacturing plant on Macadam Avenue, in South Portland, was opened. The new plant was destroyed by fire[8] in 1957[13] and had to be rebuilt. In 1962, ESI announced plans to create a new development called "Sunset Science Park", to be built in the Cedar Mill area of unincorporated Washington County, Oregon, designed to attract other technology companies, with ESI as an anchor.[14] The company moved its headquarters to the Sunset Science Park location in 1963, and the manufacturing facilities followed in 1966, vacating the Macadam Avenue site. The complex on N.W. Science Park Drive, which remains ESI's headquarters today, has a Portland mailing address, but is not in the city of Portland proper; it occupies unincorporated land which is now adjacent to the city limits of Beaverton.
ESI became a publicly traded company in 1983.[2][15] The company opened its first foreign sales office in 1978, in Munich, Germany, and later opened offices in several countries in Southeast Asia.[16] The company now has offices for direct sales in several European countries, as well.[17]
Several small companies were acquired by ESI in the late 1990s, including Dynamotion Corp. (of California) in 1997,[18] Chip Star Inc. (California) in 1997,[19] Applied Intelligent Systems Inc. (AISI) (Michigan) in 1997[20] and Testec Corp. (Arizona) in 1999.[21]
A new manufacturing facility was opened in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in early 2001.[22] The company acquired California-based New Wave Research Inc. in 2007.[23] At the beginning of 2009, Electro Scientific had around 700 employees, about half of whom were located in Oregon.[5] Edward C. Grady was named as the president and CEO of ESI in February 2014.[24]
The company acquired fiber laser manufacturer Eolite Systems in June 2012,[25] the semiconductor systems business from GSI Group in May 2013,[26] and Chinese laser firm Wuhan Topwin Optoelectronics Technology Co. in January 2015.[27]
In August 2016, the company announced that Michael Burger, formerly CEO of Cascade Microtech, would succeed Edward Grady as CEO effective October 3, 2016.[28]
Annexation fight[edit]
In 2005, ESI joined Columbia Sportswear, Tektronix and other Washington County companies in an effort led by Nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of "islands" of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city.[29] The Nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of Beaverton in 2004, under which the city had added more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) of unincorporated land, including the headquarters of Leupold & Stevens[30] (located almost adjacent to ESI, but on the opposite side of the Sunset Highway freeway). Although the headquarters of ESI and Columbia are not on "islands" surrounded by Beaverton, both directly abut the city boundary, and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the city's annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island. The 2005 Oregon Legislature enacted a law prohibiting Beaverton from any forced island-type annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning Beaverton from forcibly annexing any of Electro Scientific Industries' property—whether an island or not—for at least 30 years.[31][32]
Operations[edit]
ESI manufactures a variety of laser-based processing and micro-manufacturing solutions designed to help manufacturers optimize their production capabilities by moving beyond the limitations of mechanical-based solutions. These include laser-based via drilling systems for printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturers and integrated circuit packaging fabricators. ESI systems also address the needs of passive component manufacturing/testing/inspection with wafer trim and circuit trim offerings. Semiconductor manufacturers use ESI systems for processing wafers. Manufacturers use ESI’s laser-based micro-machining platforms for component part manufacturing and marking.
ESI’s manufacturing facilities are distributed across the US and Asia, from the headquarters campus in Portland, to Klamath Falls, Oregon, Fremont, California, Bozeman, Montana and Singapore. In Asia, the primary operation hub is located in Shanghai.
The NASDAQ-traded company had annual revenues of $159.1 million for fiscal year 2015.[33]
Products[edit]
ESI’s interconnect and micro-fabrication products are used to create nano-scale features on a variety of materials and substrates in high-volume manufacturing. The company’s semiconductor products include automated ultra-thin wafer dicing and high-throughput, high-accuracy grooving systems.[34] In the area of component test and inspection, ESI offers automated test, termination, high-speed handling and visual inspection equipment for manufacturing of miniature multilayer ceramic passive components and other components, such as arrays, inductors and varistors. It also manufactures fiber, rod and solid state lasers and ablation lasers for use in laser manufacturing systems.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
