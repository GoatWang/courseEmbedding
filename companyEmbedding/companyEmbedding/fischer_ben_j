Higher US interest rates, a weakening US dollar, a recovery in the high-yield bond markets and strengthening commodity markets are all signs that a shift from growth to value investing may already be occurring.

About UsIn 1915, Charles A. and Rose Fischer started Charles A. Fischer and Sons, a hardware store at 517 Ferry St. in Newark, New Jersey. They sold washboards, roll roofing, shingles, and industrial supplies.  The customers were neighborhood home owners, small contractors, and manufacturers.
            In 1952, Jerry and Ed Fischer, the second generation, took charge of the family business.  They moved up the street to 523-525 Ferry St and 10-12 Cortland Place in Newark, New Jersey.  They handled a full line of industrial supplies from heavy tools to fasteners and a complete line of maintenance and repair items for large factories, manufacturers, leather tanning, and food processing companies.
            In 1964, Jerry Fischer took sole ownership of the business and renamed the company to J.H. Fischer and Son and remained at the same location.  In 1970, Al Fischer, the third generation took charge of J.H. Fischer and Son.  After becoming an authorized Parker Hannifin distributor, the business started serving additional markets.  Stevedores, shipping companies, utilities, and off the road heavy equipment became new markets for the company.  Hydraulic hoses and fittings, quick couplers, tube fittings, brass, large size Grade 8 and Grade 5 bolts and industrial rubber hose and hose accessories became standard stocked items of the company.
            In 1982 a new large pallet racked warehouse was built on adjacent property.  The company’s address was and remains 523-531 Ferry St. and 10-12 Cortland Place in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey.
            Metric hydraulic hose and fittings, metric fasteners and metric tools, as well as a full line of industrial, safety, and contractor supplies, are stocked in the company’s three warehouses.
            In 2005, Ben Fischer, the fourth generation, entered the family business.  He added other markets to the company’s customer base.  J.H. Fischer and Son became a major supplier to site contractors, road and bridge contractors, as well as pavers and quarries.  The company stocks standard, semi standard, and hard to find items.  It is the company’s mission to have the items in stock for its customers for immediate delivery at competitive prices.  If it is a new item that is not stocked, as we say, we will Fisch it up for you.  Come meet our family and friendly employees and see our extensive inventory.

Web Chess
Description: A web based chess GUI using modern standards and tools.
The layout of the board and interface was accomplished using HTML5. CSS3 selectors and properties are used to style the board and interface. All interactivity is coded with Javascript using the jQuery library.
The game is still a work in progress. Key functionality like the checkmate and stalemate routines still need to be coded.


Live Site






















Solus - An Oregon Lighting Agency
Description: Catalog site for Portland company
Created PHP templates using HTML5 and CSS3 styles for intigration into final Wordpress site.
Styles were implimented using SASS/Compass


Live Site






















PaulAlone.com
Description: This site was created to provide a web presence for a Portland based musician / photographer / designer.
I designed a site to showcase his various creative talents, with a photography gallery, listing of released albums, and an upcoming performance list. I also implemented a simple web-based CMS to allow him to add additional content and update performance information on the go.
I used Spry for the accordion and tab effects initially. I'm working on switching this over to jQuery UI. I'm also working on changing the galleries from CSS driven effects to Fancybox.



















Poetry Review
Description: A coded prototype of a front-end interface for reviewers to read, comment on and approve or deny submissions for a literary magazine.
HTML5 and CSS3 were used to give the interface a stream-lined modern look. I also used @media queries to allow for a responsive layout based on screen width.

Geek Out
Description: This is a fully coded design for a science fiction themed blog.
The navigation is absolutely positioned to keep it on screen while scrolling.

Bio


Originally hailing from Western Michigan, I relocated to Portland in 1998 after acquiring an Associates Degree in Business with a CIS focus from Baker College. In 2008 I decided to continue my education, and enrolled in the Art Institute of Portland to study Web Design and Interactive Media.
In 2012 I relocated to New York City, and took a position with Harrison and Star.
I’ve had an interest in computers since before they had disk drives. I learned BASIC by reading the manual that came with my first CoCo Computer from RadioShack. I’ve been writing fiction and drawing for almost that long. My first webpage was on GeoCites written by gleaning source code from other sites, while I was still at Baker. 
I have been working in the industry since 2010, building responsive websites and emails.

The Curv


 





THE PERFECT CURV
Think of a hard, freshly groomed slope in the morning. Like wheels on rails. Pure adrenaline, total power and full concentration – in every turn. The snow crunches, the edges burn – "THE PERFECT CURV".
But what is the perfect curve? What makes it stand out and how do skis have to be designed to experience perfect curve performance? These were the questions our three skiing legends Hans Knauss, Mike von Grüningen and Kristian Ghedina had in mind when developing the CURV. 


























Pure adrenalin for uncompromising skiers!
Extremely close to the professional equipment from the World Cup but still suitable for the slopes. THE CURV makes extreme performance manageable with a high-quality technology package: Triple Radius enables previously unattained dynamic turns, the Progressive Sidecut concept means the ski has the optimum dimensions for the preferred skiing style and the DiagotexTM carbon laminate which is known from racing makes sure that torsion is perfect every time when cornering. The two-section Curv Booster plate makes cornering extremely quick and ensures optimum power transfer. This makes every turn simply breathtaking! 























 


Efficient Forward


 





Efficient kick
Full concentration on the snow-covered winter landscape instead of the kick action! Because Efficient Forward technology compensates any errors and flaws in the kick action effectively. The new elasticity of the ski supports the interaction of the climbing zone and the snow beneath it in a previously unknown form. The result: the timing of the kick action does not have to be so exact, leaving you more time for the contact in the kick phase. This ensures that power is transferred to the track in impressive style, even if your own skiing style is not world championship level. This positive feedback from the equipment is a great motivator when it comes to having fun with healthy exercise while enjoying the great outdoors! 


























Easy-going
Enjoying the perfect skiing experience has never been as easy as it is today: which comes as no surprise, seeing as the weight saved by the new construction compared to the previous model is up to 200 grams. The combination of this light weight and the elasticity of the ski culminates in the whole new, forgiving kick action and carefree cross country skiing experience. This will be appreciated above all by skiers who are not so technically accomplished. A word of warning: with Efficient Forward, Fischer has given its Sport models a technology package which can become addictive!
