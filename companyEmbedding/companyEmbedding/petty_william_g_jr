Jackie Clegg, Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Brookdale's Board, added, "Bill's proven leadership in the senior living industry, along with his expertise in finance and healthcare, led the Committee to unanimously recommend his appointment to our Board."
Mr. Petty's appointment is effective immediately for a term scheduled to expire at the Company's 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. He has also been appointed to the Investment Committee of the Board.  
William G. Petty, Jr.
Mr. Petty is a partner of Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Company, a private equity management firm he co-founded in 1996, which currently has approximately $1.3 billion under management. Mr. Petty's prior leadership experience includes service as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. from January 2013 to April 2014; as Chief Executive Officer of Alternative Living Services, Inc./Alterra Healthcare Corporation from 1993 to 1996 and as its Chairman from 1993 to 2000; as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evergreen Healthcare, Inc. and as a director of that company's publicly-traded successors (GranCare, Inc. and Mariner Health Care Inc.); and as a director and member of the executive committee of Forum Group, Inc. In 1985, he co-founded Omega Capital Ltd., a private investment fund focused on the healthcare industry, which formed Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc., a healthcare REIT, during his tenure as managing director. In addition, he has served on the boards of directors of several Beecken Petty portfolio companies. Mr. Petty received a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of Illinois.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
