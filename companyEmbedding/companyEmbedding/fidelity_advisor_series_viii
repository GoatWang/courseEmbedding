The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryForeign Large GrowthFund FamilyFidelity InvestmentsNet Assets2.1BYTD Return16.05%Yield0.85%Morningstar Rating★★★Inception DateDec 16, 1998Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.00Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover31.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseFDVAXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)1.22%1.21%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio1.23%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio1.23%N/AMax 12b1 Fee0.25%N/AMax Front End Sales Load5.75%5.21%Max Deferred Sales LoadN/A1.95%3 Yr Expense Projection943N/A5 Yr Expense Projection1,212N/A10 Yr Expense Projection1,978N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
