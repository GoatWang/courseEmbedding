Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd. Key Developments

Alberta Energy Regulator Approves Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd. to Operate Oil and Gas Assets in Alberta
Jul 26 17
Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd. announced that the it has been approved by Alberta Energy Regulator to Operate oil and gas assets in Alberta. This is an important step for Hillcrest to move forward with the Alberta part of its work program to re-establish production from oil and gas assets in Alberta and Saskatchewan under its recently announced Joint Venture Agreement with Juniorco.


Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd. Signs Binding Joint Venture Agreement with Juniorco
May 10 17
Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd. announced that the company has signed a binding Joint Venture Agreement (the JV Agreement) with a Juniorco whereby the company, via a wholly owned subsidiary, will earn up to a 75% Working Interest and become the operator of record in two petroleum assets located in Western Canada (the Fields or Assets). The company expects to restore production from the Fields collectively to approximately 400 barrels of oil per day ("bopd) by providing capital funding and additional technical and operational expertise. As announced on February 21, 2017, The company expects that production from the Fields will be restored during the second quarter of this year. The company also has plans to pursue further production increases from within the Fields through additional development activities in the remainder of 2017. The JV Agreement is consistent with the letter agreement initially signed by the parties and announced on February 21, 2017. The primary terms of the JV Agreement are as follows: The company, appointed as operator, will earn up to 75% of the Juniorco's Working Interest in the Fields by contributing technical expertise and funding to restore production from the Fields. Hillcrest's Working Interest will revert to 50% once the Company has recovered all production restoration costs from the production revenues. Gross production from both Fields collectively is expected to be approximately 400 bopd upon restoration. Hillcrest has arranged third party project funding, and these funds are to be provided on a non-dilutive basis to Hillcrest shareholders. Total project funding, including the placement of Operator deposits and Licence Liability Rating (LLR) Bonds, is estimated to cost CAD 2,200,000. Project funding will be secured by both the Assets and the company. Approximately CAD 900,000 in project costs is required to re-establish production from the Fields by way of equipment installation and upgrades, and well work-overs. These projects are expected to reduce operating expenses and restore production, thereby increasing the operating netbacks. Project costs include the placement of approximately CAD 1,300,000 in LLR Bonds. The company will consistent with the regulatory requirement request the return of these LLR Bonds once economic production from the Fields has been re-established for a certain period of time, thereby substantially reducing the net investment in the project. The company will also immediately commence assessment of additional infield development opportunities, such as well re-completions and infill development drilling, which will be pursued in the second half of this year. Hillcrest shall obtain the regulatory approvals required for the Company to perform as an oil and gas operator within the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Such regulatory approvals are expected within 30 days. Upon obtaining all regulatory approvals, the production restoration project will commence. This transaction is subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.

As reported in May this year, Hillcrest signed a binding joint venture agreement with a Canadian oil and gas company


 

The plan is to restore production from the fields collectively to some 400 barrels of oil per day








Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd (CVE:HRH) has taken a further step to restoring oil production in Western Canada, with a nod from the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER).

	The firm has, importantly now been approved to operate oil and gas assets in Alberta.

	As reported in May this year, Hillcrest had signed a binding joint venture agreement with a Canadian oil and gas company  that will see it earn a 75% working interest in two assets.

	It will also become the operator of record on the prospects.

	The plan is to restore production from the fields collectively to some 400 barrels of oil per day by providing capital financing and additional technical and operational expertise.

	Hillcrest's working interest will revert to 50% once it has recovered all production restoration costs from the production revenues.

	"The first step required to move forward with restoring production has been reached," said Donald Currie, Hillcrest chief executive.

	"Being approved as operator in the province of Alberta was required for Hillcrest too co-ordinate work programs with local service companies and vendors. The company will update the shareholders as we progress towards production of the assets."

	Hillcrest said total project financing, including the placement of operator deposits and licence liability rating (LLR) bonds, is estimated to cost $2.2mln and will be secured from a third party by both the assets and the company.

	It is estimated that around C$900,000 will be needed to bring production back on line via equipment installation and upgrades and well workovers.

	These projects are expected to reduce operating expenses and restore production, thereby increasing the operating netbacks.

	Project costs include the placement of around $1.3mln LLR bonds. The company expects to recover these bonds once economic production from the fields has been re-established for a period, thereby substantially reducing the net investment in the project.

	Shares in Toronto are down over 7% on Thursday at $0.06.

Funds from the share issue will be used, among other things, to retire the rest of the company's secured debt


 

Units will be placed at seven cents a pop








Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd (CVE:HRH) is proceeding with its previously announced non-brokered private placement, it told shareholders on Friday.

	The company announced the plans to raise cash back on 10 May, when it pulled the trigger on its planned acquisition of interests in two petroleum assets in Western Canada.

	READ Hillcrest Petroleum goes for it in Western Canada

	READ Hillcrest to earn 75% of Western Canadian petroleum assets

	The plan is to place up to 7.14mln units at a price of seven cents a pop to raise up to C$500,000, so it can retire the rest of the company’s secured debt, and pay registration and licensing costs for its assets in Saskatchewan and Alberta.

	Each unit will consist of one common share plus one-half of one common share purchase warrant, so warrant holders will need two half-share warrants to convert into a complete common share, which will be at an exercise price of 10 cents..

	Hillcrest said it is finalizing certain required documentation to close the placement, which may, as a result of timing issues, take place in chunks, or tranches.

As reported in May this year, Hillcrest signed a binding joint venture agreement with a Canadian oil and gas company


 

The plan is to restore production from the fields collectively to some 400 barrels of oil per day








Hillcrest Petroleum Ltd (CVE:HRH) has taken a further step to restoring oil production in Western Canada, with a nod from the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER).

	The firm has, importantly now been approved to operate oil and gas assets in Alberta.

	As reported in May this year, Hillcrest had signed a binding joint venture agreement with a Canadian oil and gas company  that will see it earn a 75% working interest in two assets.

	It will also become the operator of record on the prospects.

	The plan is to restore production from the fields collectively to some 400 barrels of oil per day by providing capital financing and additional technical and operational expertise.

	Hillcrest's working interest will revert to 50% once it has recovered all production restoration costs from the production revenues.

	"The first step required to move forward with restoring production has been reached," said Donald Currie, Hillcrest chief executive.

	"Being approved as operator in the province of Alberta was required for Hillcrest too co-ordinate work programs with local service companies and vendors. The company will update the shareholders as we progress towards production of the assets."

	Hillcrest said total project financing, including the placement of operator deposits and licence liability rating (LLR) bonds, is estimated to cost $2.2mln and will be secured from a third party by both the assets and the company.

	It is estimated that around C$900,000 will be needed to bring production back on line via equipment installation and upgrades and well workovers.

	These projects are expected to reduce operating expenses and restore production, thereby increasing the operating netbacks.

	Project costs include the placement of around $1.3mln LLR bonds. The company expects to recover these bonds once economic production from the fields has been re-established for a period, thereby substantially reducing the net investment in the project.

	Shares in Toronto are down over 7% on Thursday at $0.06.
