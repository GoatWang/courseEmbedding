What We Offer
Communication strategies and skills to leverage every business opportunity






 




Tailored Training

 


 


LeVan Partners offers accelerated and proven development programs for executives and high-potential associates in the following core skill areas:

Presenting with Impact
Selling with Impact
Meetings with Impact
Perfect Pitch Planning and Execution
Communicating with Leadership Impact

These interactive programs can be tailored not only to your industry or team, but also to your executive development needs to build a curriculum. For example:

The “small group coaching” approach of LeVan Partners’ 2-day flagship training programs offers just the right combination of learning content, facilitated colleague discussion, individualized challenge plus personal feedback appropriate for experienced professionals on the executive track.
Half-day formats can be used

To give new managers and client-facing associates more confidence
To introduce more junior associates to a “professional discipline” around business communication
As a refresher for executives


For larger groups, Coaching Clinics can be added to the half-day format to create 1-day to 3-day programs that focus on specific skill-building opportunities for selected sub-groups or teams.

Contact LeVan Partners to design a training/coaching program that’s a strategic fit for your organization or team.

 
 
 
 




One-on-One Coaching

 


 


Skill-specific coaching
LeVan Partners coaching can be used to address all core skill areas—presenting, selling and influencing, meeting facilitation, pitch planning and leadership communication.  It offers a way to fill development gaps with the confidentiality and individually-paced learning sometimes preferred by senior managers.
Event-specific coaching
This type of coaching provides a “learning burst” of just-in-time support for those high-stakes situations that can make or break careers:  board meetings, conference presentations, town hall meetings, investor calls, media interviews and panels.  Give us the deadline.  We’ll get you up to speed.
Both types of coaching solutions may be implemented either as stand-alone engagements or as an effective follow-up complement to a LeVan Partners tailored training program.

 
 
 
 




Consulting

 


 


Pitch team consulting
When the stakes are high for your sales team, hands-on consulting by LeVan Partners can get them to the finish line in first place.  We’ll help you apply winning strategies, processes, and persuasive techniques to build and maximize a team’s strengths and capitalize on any competitive opportunity.
Internal communications consulting
When your next change management initiative or product/service rollout demands better internal communication and processes, consult LeVan Partners first.  We’ll diagnose the breakdowns, identify the opportunities, then recommend—or help you implement—solutions that will change communication dynamics for the best business outcomes.

Who We Are - LeVan Partners













































 

















Select Page


  
 



 



 








 




We give you the communication edge.

 

Who We Are
We know why you’re here. Let’s face it. Your high-potential associates can have the business experience and technical skills to lead your industry or domain area, and still not be seen, heard, viewed as “strategic” or polished enough to lead the charge or take that next step. Or, maybe they’re less comfortable with certain audiences or situations.
That’s why LeVan Partners is here. We’re experts in interpersonal business communication. We give executives, business developers and subject matter experts the communication edge to master all their critical “touch points.”

High-stakes presentations
Team pitches
Leadership forums
Team meetings
Internal influencing and external sales conversations
Negotiation

LeVan Partners offers more than tips and tricks. We give you both the communication strategy and skills to drive the kind of business results that lead to professional success.
We’ve been doing it since 2003 for some of the most premier financial trading institutions, manufacturing, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, research, insurance and consulting firms. We’ve helped CEO’s, CFO’s, CAO’s and CIO’s get to where they are today.
Our methodology is favored by top Fortune 500 global corporations, and our communication training has been used as part of executive development programs from Harvard and the Kellogg School of Management.
To understand the Way we do it, you can learn more about our proven approach in Speaking with Strategic Impact: Four Steps to Extraordinary Presence & Persuasion by Kate LeVan.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
