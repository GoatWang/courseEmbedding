News RoomPress CoveragePress ReleasesAwardsEvents< Back to All Press ReleasesDelta Risk LLC and AlienVault Team Up to Help Companies Fight RansomwareSecurity Firms to Host Educational Webinar on October 27 on HIPAA Compliance and RansomwareSAN ANTONIO, TX – October 25, 2016 — Ransomware attacks are on the rise, with a 300 percent increase in daily attacks since the beginning of the year, according to a recent U.S. government interagency report. With so many organizations being affected, Delta Risk LLC, a global provider of cyber security and risk management services, announced today that it is hosting a webinar with AlienVault®, the leading provider of Unified Security Management™ (USM) and crowdsourced threat intelligence, to educate security professionals on what they can do to address ransomware attacks. The online event will focus on the growing impact of ransomware, particularly as it relates to organizations that must meet Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance requirements, and how to prevent and mitigate the threat.The webinar is taking place on October 27, 1 PM ET, and is free to attend. Registration is available via the Delta Risk website: http://www.delta-risk.net/webinars/Chris Hendricks, Vice President of Security Operations for Delta Risk, will be joined by Garrett Gross, Director of Field Enablement for AlienVault, for the live webinar, “What You Need to Know About Ransomware and HIPAA Compliance.” The two will discuss the financial and regulatory impact of ransomware attacks, and a strategy to address them that includes awareness training, exercises, and an incident response plan; tools for vulnerability assessment, asset discovery, audits, and backup tests; and how to use monitoring, analysis, and compromise assessments.There have been 4,000 daily ransomware attacks reported since early 2016 – a 300 percent increase over 2015, as noted in the U.S. Government Interagency Guidance Document, How to Protect Your Networks from Ransomware. Healthcare is among the top industries to be affected, security experts caution, with 53 percent of healthcare organizations surveyed by Osterman Research reporting a ransomware attack in the past 12 months. Ransomware can compromise valuable patient data, and even shut down care facilities and hospitals. Considering this, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has recently issued guidance on ransomware attacks for organizations that handle protected health information (PHI).In the notification, the OCR makes clear that it essentially considers ransomware attacks to be HIPAA data breaches by default (with associated mandatory response notification responsibilities and potential costs) unless a post-event risk assessment solidly points to the contrary. The penalties for non-compliance with HIPAA requirements are steep. The OCR has announced nearly $15 million in settlement payments to the HHS in the first seven months of 2016 alone relating to compliance failures alleged against covered entities and business associates.Delta Risk, a long-time AlienVault partner, has integrated the AlienVault USM platform into its flagship product, ActiveEye, as part of its 24x7 security monitoring capabilities. ActiveEye is a vendor-agnostic managed security solution that provides continuous security monitoring of networks, along with trained personnel, to prevent and detect cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware attacks and data breaches.“With ransomware incidents affecting so many hospitals and care providers, it’s more important than ever for them to assess their risk and take steps to prevent attacks,” Hendricks noted. “But many organizations simply don’t have all the technical skills and in-house resources they need to detect and prevent cyber security issues, and they don’t want to take on the costs of buying and implementing new technology on their own, much less manage it. By incorporating AlienVault’s technology into our managed security services, we are able to provide a better solution for our customers.”In addition to ActiveEye threat monitoring, alerting, and mitigation, Delta Risk’s ransomware prevention, detection, and response services include defense architecture assessments, internal and external vulnerability scanning, simulated active cyber threat and incident response exercises, and compromise assessments.“Delta Risk’s consulting expertise, combined with our technology, provides a cost-effective way for healthcare organizations and other businesses that handle PHI to address their security and compliance needs,” said Mike LaPeters, Vice President of Global Channel Sales for AlienVault. “AlienVault’s unified security management and threat intelligence platform helps Delta Risk customers reduce the time to detect and respond to threats such as ransomware.”Additional ResourcesLearn more about Delta RiskDownload our e-guide on ransomwareFollow us on Twitter, LinkedIn, and FacebookAbout Delta Risk LLCDelta Risk LLC provides tailored, high-impact cybersecurity and risk management services to government and private sector clients worldwide.

SAN ANTONIO, June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Delta Risk LLC, a global provider of cyber security and risk management services, announced today that the U.S. Government Services Administration (GSA) has awarded the company an IT-70 contract, #GS35F482GA. The award includes six Services Special Item Numbers (SINs), including all four Highly Adaptive Cyber Security Services SINs. Delta Risk is now one of a select group of companies that hold all four specialized cyber security designations. 










 







							 		Delta Risk LLC, a global provider of cyber security and risk management services, was awarded a U.S. Government Services Administration (GSA) IT-70 contract, #GS35F482GA. The award includes six Services Special Item Numbers (SINs), including all four Highly Adaptive Cyber Security Services SINs, said Richard Burke, Vice President of Public Sector at Delta Risk.
							  



 

 
 



The award recognizes Delta Risk's expertise in providing specialized cyber security services to help organizations before, during, and after a cyber incident, with particular focus on identifying and mitigating cyber risks and vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. This long-term IT contract adds Delta Risk to a pre-approved list of technology companies for federal purchases, thereby simplifying the procurement process and further ensuring government agencies receive high-quality, cost-effective cyber security services. 
GSA awarded Delta Risk the following Cyber SIN awards:

Penetration Testing (SIN # 132-45A) 
Incident Response (SIN # 132-45B) 
Cyber Hunt (SIN # 132-45C) 
Risk and Vulnerability (SIN # 132-45D)

GSA also awarded the company two additional SINS:

Training Services (SIN # 132-50) 
Professional Services (SIN # 132-51)

"Delta Risk has focused on expanding our cyber capabilities and services in the past year, as well as our ability to reach federal clients as a prime contractor," said Richard Burke, Vice President of Public Sector at Delta Risk. "With this GSA award, Delta Risk can deliver specialized cyber security services with our cadre of expert cyber professionals."  
"The award makes it much easier for federal agencies to access our team's expertise in vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, cyber hunt and incident response, as well as cyber security governance and training," added Jill White, Director of Contracts for Delta Risk.
The base period of the contract began June 7, 2017, and ends June 6, 2022, with the potential of three five-year options to follow.
