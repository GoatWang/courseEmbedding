4. All other terms and provisions of the Agreement not amended herein shall

Registrant's last fiscal year.                                

ITEM 30.  LOCATION OF ACCOUNTS AND RECORDS 

Each account, book or other document required to be maintained by Section 31(a) 
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rules 31a-1 to 31a-3 thereunder are   
maintained by the Company at 440 Lincoln Street, Worcester, Massachusetts.      

ITEM 31.  MANAGEMENT SERVICES 

Effective March 31, 1995, the Company provides daily unit value calculations and
related services for the Company's separate accounts.                           

ITEM 32.  UNDERTAKINGS 

  (a)   The Registrant hereby undertakes to file a post-effective amendment to
     this registration statement as frequently as is necessary to ensure
         that the audited financial statements in the registration statement are
 never more than 16 months old for so long as payments under the
variable annuity contracts may be accepted.                   

(b)   The Registrant hereby undertakes to include in the prospectus a     
   postcard that the applicant can remove to send for a Statement of
Additional Information.                                       

 (c)   The Registrant hereby undertakes to deliver a Statement of Additional
        Information and any financial statements promptly upon written or oral
request, according to the requirements of Form N-4.           

   (d)   Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the 1933 Act may
be permitted to Directors, Officers and Controlling Persons of
        Registrant under any registration statement, underwriting agreement or
    otherwise, Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against
public policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and is, therefore, 
      unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
    such liabilities (other than the payment by Registrant of expenses
  incurred or paid by a Director, Officer or Controlling Person of
         Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
is asserted by such Director, Officer or Controlling Person in
   connection with the securities being registered, Registrant will,
     unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
      controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
   the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
       policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.                                   

   (e)   The Company hereby represents that the aggregate fees and charges under
   the Policies are reasonable in relation to the services rendered,
     expenses expected to be incurred, and risks assumed by the Company.

ITEM 33. REPRESENTATIONS CONCERNING WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS ON SECTION 403(b)   
PLANS AND UNDER THE TEXAS OPTIONAL RETIREMENT PROGRAM 

Registrant, a separate account of Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and        
Annuity Company ("Company"), states that it is (a) relying on Rule 6c-7 under   
the 1940 Act with respect to withdrawal restrictions under the Texas Optional   
Retirement Program ("Program") and (b) relying on the "no-action" letter (Ref.  
No. IP-6-88) issued on November 28, 1988 to the American Council of Life        
Insurance, in applying the withdrawal restrictions of Internal Revenue Code     
Section 403(b)(11). Registrant has taken the following steps in reliance on the 
letter:                                                                         

 1.    Appropriate disclosures regarding the redemption restrictions imposed
    by the Program and by Section 403(b)(11) have been included in the
       prospectus of each registration statement used in connection with the
offer of the Company's variable contracts.                    

 2.    Appropriate disclosures regarding the redemption restrictions imposed
      by the Program and by Section 403(b)(11) have been included in sales
        literature used in connection with the offer of the Company's variable
contracts.                                                    

   3.    Sales Representatives who solicit participants to purchase the variable
     contracts have been instructed to specifically bring the redemption
      restrictions imposed by the Program and by Section 403(b)(11) to the
attention of potential participants.                          

   4.    A signed statement acknowledging the participant's understanding of (i)
      the restrictions on redemption imposed by the Program and by Section
     403(b)(11) and (ii) the investment alternatives available under the
   employer's arrangement will be obtained from each participant who
  purchases a variable annuity contract prior to or at the time of
purchase.                                                     

Registrant hereby represents that it will not act to deny or limit a transfer   
request except to the extent that a Service-Ruling or written opinion of        
counsel, specifically addressing the fact pattern involved and taking into      
account the terms of the applicable employer plan, determines that denial or    
limitation is necessary for the variable annuity contracts to meet the          
requirements of the Program or of Section 403(b). Any transfer request not so   
denied or limited will be effected as expeditiously as possible.

Applicants' Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (“THG”), formerly Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Start Printed Page 20666Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the outstanding ordinary shares.
3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of “separate account,” as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios (“Substitutions”):

7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently has 30 separate portfolios (each, a “Global Atlantic Fund,” and collectively, the “Global Atlantic Funds”). The following 13 Global Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Insights Portfolio.
8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global Atlantic.
9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC (“BlackRock”) or Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.[2] 

15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), and for those Contracts with assets allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Start Printed Page 20669Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution Date (the “Pre-Substitution Notice”). Pre-Substitution Notices sent to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a “Confirmation”) informing them that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17 Start Printed Page 20670Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants' Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from the Commission.
3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 7 Start Printed Page 20671above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.

2.
     The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
