Panasonic Company History and Information

Panasonic has long been devoted to progressing society as a whole  worldwide. Through the innovative designs and techniques used by Panasonic, the company strives to better the world one household at a time. Panasonic vacuum cleaners and other household appliances are engineered with this in mind: to make all household chores easier on consumers. 
Konosuke Matsushita founded the beginnings of Panasonic in 1918, after working hard to support his family first in a hibachi kitchen, then as an apprentice. 


As the company took off, Matsushita began to explore the opportunities of new technological products rising in the industry worldwide. Two of the companys first inventions that pushed Panasonic to be a global success were the two-way socket and the attachment plug. These products achieved immense popularity, and led to Panasonics expansion in 1922. 
Since then, Panasonic has grown to include household appliances such as refrigerators, kitchen gadgets, vacuum cleaners and more. All of these products are designed to globally integrate into households by matching consumer wants and needs. 
New products released by Panasonic are consumer-driven, with designs made to meet the needs of customers. 


One such example of a consumer-driven product is Panasonics line of vacuum cleaners, which produce low noise and perform at a high quality level and are still affordable for modern households. With the Panasonic company vision of meeting consumer needs by targeting those needs specifically, Panasonic products are built to last. 
By constantly improving its products for its customer base, Panasonic was able to grow into a world leader for home appliances.

This was a great experience for me after I broke a handle on my carpet cleaner. It was simple to locate the part I needed from the pictures and descriptions and the ordering was simple as well. Thanks to all concerned!

Website very friendly - no issues navigating the website and ordering was a breeze - what I absolutely loved about ordering was I was ordering parts for a vacuum and you had access to a diagram of the vacuum so I was able to order the correct part - fantastic - will for sure use you again if the need arises - loved it - keep up the great work
