Age: 51
Personal: Kathy Redd declined to comment for this profile, citing her company’s pending acquisition of Rocketdyne. In 2010 she told the Business Journal that she and her husband had two teenage daughters.
HOW SHE SHAPED THE YEAR IN BUSINESS
Redd joined GenCorp in 2002 as assistant corporate controller and became CFO in January 2009. She played a key role as GenCorp this year grew to become the largest locally based public company by market capitalization. The company is on track to grow larger still with its $555 million acquisition of Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne from Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp. That deal, expected to close in 2013, will add another 2,000 employees and several more locations for GenCorp.




PLANS FOR 2013
To close the purchase of Rocketdyne and integrate two legacy rocket motor manufacturers — both of which had their biggest days during the Cold War. The two now must compete in the civilian and government space sectors.

Mark Anderson covers agriculture, banking and finance, restaurants and hospitality for the Sacramento Business Journal.
