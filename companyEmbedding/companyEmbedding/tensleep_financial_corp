Tensleep Describes Business for 2005 and Discusses Plans for 2006






January 31, 2006 10:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



				AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2006--Tensleep Corporation (OTC:TENS)("Tensleep"), a business and development company, announced that during 2005, Tensleep and its subsidiaries and affiliates engaged in the following activities which had the indicated effects on its financial affairs:  -- In January 2005, Amcor Financial Corp. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, which placed the value of Tensleep's investment, approximately $700,000, in jeopardy.  -- In March 2005, Tensleep closed an agreement with the shareholders of Yeahronimo Media Ventures, Inc., for the reverse acquisition of its Tensleep Technologies, Inc. ("TNSP") subsidiary. Subsequently, TNSP's name was changed to Commodore International Corporation, whose trading symbol is CDRL.  -- In December 2005, Tensleep entered into a contract to sell 1,000,000 shares of Commodore common stock for $1,100,000. The transaction is to be completed by the end of March 2006. Tensleep has received $100,000 towards the purchase price. After the sale, Tensleep will have approximately 97,000 unsold shares, and will have a gain of approximately $700,000.  -- Tensleep received a royalty in the amount of $16,503 for the year from the license of its modem integrated circuit design.  -- Tensleep has continued to develop its wireless transmitters and receivers with limited sales in its Tensleep Wireless Corporation subsidiary. Because of limited funds and no sales personnel, Tensleep Wireless is considered a development stage company.  In 2006 Tensleep's business activities are designed to focus on its reorganized business. The business plan includes:  -- Tensleep being reorganized into a consumer electronic products and services holding company, and transferring its development business, both business and corporate, to its subsidiary Tensleep Financial Corporation.  -- Tensleep will form and organize two operating companies, one to do business in Europe and one in the United States.  -- Tensleep plans to sell or spin-off its Tensleep Wireless subsidiary, and to spin-off its Tensleep Financial Corporation subsidiary.  -- Once Tensleep Wireless and Tensleep Financial are spun-off or Tensleep Wireless sold, Tensleep will prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, thus becoming a reporting company and move the trading of its common stock to the Bulletin Board.  -- Tensleep plans to continue to acquire licenses or Intellectual Property (IP) for consumer electronic products.  -- Tensleep plans to enter into joint ventures with European companies for the distribution of their consumer electronic products in the United States.  -- Tensleep plans to call a special meeting of shareholders to approve an increase of its authorized common stock to 150,000,000 shares.  Tensleep Corporation has been a business and corporate development company specializing in the capital and financial restructuring and reorganization of public and private companies, enabling them to secure financing.
