Bryan Timm, a 17-year company veteran who has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer since October 2008, has been elevated to President and Chief Operating Officer of Columbia Sportswear Company, effective immediately. Tim Boyle, who has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the company since 1988, will continue to lead the company as Chief Executive Officer.
In his new role, Timm will oversee the company’s wholesale sales function in North America, as well as direct-to-consumer operations in North America and Europe, while retaining his current leadership role over the company’s global sourcing, supply chain and distribution operations. He will also direct the brand leaders at the company’s Mountain Hardwear brand, headquartered in Richmond, Calif., and the recently-acquired prAna brand, headquartered in Carlsbad, Calif.
Elsewhere, Peter Bragdon has been promoted to the new title of Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, effective immediately. Bragdon is a 13-year company veteran who has served as Senior Vice President of Legal and Corporate Affairs, General Counsel and Secretary since 2010. And Tom Cusick has been promoted to the new title of Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Cusick is a 12-year company veteran who has advanced through progressive financial management roles, serving as Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer since 2010.
READ ALSO:   Smartwool Adds Staff for European Market“Strong momentum behind each of our largest brands drove our global net sales to more than $2.1 billion in 2014 and is expected to fuel continued double-digit currency-neutral growth in 2015,” said Boyle. “The leadership changes that we are announcing today are intended to position us to secure the significant global growth potential that we believe exists within each of the brands in our portfolio.”
All three executives will continue to report directly to Boyle.
