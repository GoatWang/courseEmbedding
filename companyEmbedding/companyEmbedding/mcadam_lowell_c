Lowell C. McAdam is chairman and chief executive officer of Verizon Communications, a leading provider of wireless, fiber-optic and global Internet networks and services.  He was named CEO on Aug. 1, 2011, and chairman on Jan. 1, 2012.

Prior to that, McAdam was Verizon’s president and COO, with responsibility for wireline and wireless operations. He was also responsible for internal services and the technology management and CIO functions.
Under his leadership as CEO, Verizon took over complete ownership of Verizon Wireless by purchasing Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in the company, positioning Verizon for a new phase of wireless growth.  He is also leading the company’s push into growth markets in the Internet of Things and mobile entertainment.  In 2015, Verizon purchased AOL and launched a social media and entertainment product, Go90, which features innovative mobile video content. McAdam is one of the architects of today’s global wireless industry, having built wireless businesses on three continents since the technology’s development in the 1980s.  He was president and CEO of Verizon Wireless from 2007 until 2010 and before that served as its executive vice president and chief operating officer.  Before joining Verizon Wireless in 2000, McAdam was president and CEO of PrimeCo Personal Communications, a joint venture owned by Bell Atlantic and Vodafone AirTouch, where he oversaw the deployment of one of the industry’s first all-digital networks.  He also served as vice president-international operations for AirTouch Communications and was lead technical partner for cellular ventures in Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Korea and Japan. Prior to joining AirTouch in 1993, he held various executive positions with Pacific Bell. McAdam is a member of the Cornell University Board of Trustees, where he chairs the Cornell Tech Board of Overseers and sits on the executive committee.  He is also a member of the GE Board of Directors.  He has co-chaired the CEO Council on Health and Innovation, which encourages the adoption of innovative strategies to improve employee health and the delivery of higher-quality, more cost-effective healthcare.  Previously, he was a director of the National Academy Foundation, a partnership between business leaders and educators that helps high schools establish technical and service academies to prepare students for college careers.  He also is past chairman of the board of directors of the CTIA, the wireless industry trade association. He earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from Cornell and a master's degree in business administration from the University of San Diego. He also spent six years in the U.S. Navy Civil Engineer Corps and became a licensed professional engineer in 1979.

Monday,  8 May 2017 |  6:29  PM ET
NEW YORK, May 8- Verizon Communications Inc does not see an urgent need to undertake a big strategic merger or acquisition, its chief executive said on Monday, as some Wall Street analysts have urged the wireless company to do.

NEW YORK, April 27- Comcast Corp's quarterly profit topped estimates on strong growth in cable and internet subscribers and hits such as "Fifty Shades Darker" and "Get Out" boosted movie revenue, the No. 1 U.S. cable operator said on Thursday.

While it has pursued other revenue streams, including a $4.48 billion deal for Yahoo Inc's core business, analysts have questioned if it should pursue a more transformative combination.

Lowell McAdam


          	CEO of Verizon Wireless


                          By Roy Asfar                          
Aug 6, 2009















Editor's Note: Veterans Advantage salutes Verizon Communications Inc. CEO Lowell McAdam. Below is our August 2009 exclusive interview naming McAdam a Veterans Advantage "TopVet" award winner, citing his leadership at the time with Verizon Wireless.
Verizon Wireless CEO Lowell C.McAdam is a product of hard work and a passion for leadership and technology. With a belief in building Verizon Wireless from the ground up, he expresses great confidence in the talent and persistence of those he leads. He’s also the product of a first-rate military education.
“It was an honor for me to be part of it,” he tells Veterans Advantage in an exclusive interview. "It’s a great way for anybody to start any career, no matter what they are involved in. The things you learn in the service will stay with you your whole life.”
Lowell McAdam served in the Navy’s Engineer Corps, at datelines as far away as Okinawa, and as local as San Diego. As a kid growing up in rural upstate New York, he studied hard, played sports and helped make ends meet for the family by working as a school janitor. ”I think I was very fortunate to work for some really outstanding leaders in the Navy and the Marine Corps,” says the leader of the nation’s largest voice and data network, with 86 million customers and nearly $50 billion in 2008 revenue. “You are doing things that matter. They can be life and death situations, and they are certainly important. And you must learn early on the meaning of delivering on your commitments, doing what you say.”
Lowell McAdam's biography is impressive. He was named the top gun at Verizon Wireless in January, 2007 after serving since 2000 as the company’s COO. Prior to that, he was the CEO of Primeco, a wireless joint venture of Vodaphone’s AirTouch and Bell Atlantic, the “Baby Bell” predecessor of parent company Verizon. He has served as vice president-international operations for AirTouch Communications and was lead technical partner for cellular ventures in Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Korea and Japan. He joined AirTouch as executive director of international applications and operations in 1993. From 1983 to 1993, he held various executive positions with Pacific Bell, including vice president of Bay Area marketing and general manager of South Bay customer services.
FROM ROTC TO C-SUITE
Partly influenced by his brother’s service in the Navy, and a desire to be an engineer, McAdam landed a Naval ROTC Scholarship, earning a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Cornell and later an MBA from the University of San Diego. He spent six years in the Navy's Engineer Corps and is a licensed professional engineer.
In the Navy, McAdam designed and built a wide range of strategic projects. “[I received] great technical learning as well as leadership learning,” he recalls.
“[I was in charge of] a lot of very important things that needed to get done. We built nuclear weapons magazines, runways, hospitals.” McAdam was even involved in the construction of movie sets for the blockbuster 1980s movie “TopGun” starring Tom Cruise as a hotshot Naval aviator.
But make no mistake about it; running a multibillion dollar business – and the largest wireless provider to the federal government – is his calling and his passion. While studying for his MBA, he met an influential professor at USD who taught him a key to business: “Hold up a problem like a diamond and look at it from different perspectives. The problem may seem insurmountable from one perspective, but if you flip it around, you may find it to be solvable. I use this technique at Verizon Wireless where we look at a lot of problems with our senior management team and turn them into opportunities."
“There’s a ton a technology here [at Verizon Wireless], but then it’s all about selling it and tailoring it to meet customers’ needs. That’s the part I enjoy the most – finding out what customers want and working and seeing that we are meeting it as a business. Profitably, I may add.”
POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR ALL WHO SERVED
Verizon Wireless prides itself in recognizing and acknowledging military service. The company was honored by Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) for preserving jobs and benefits for those who deploy overseas. It has special policies in place to suspend service or billing for customers who are called to service. CEO Ivan Seidenberg and COO Dennis Strigl of corporate parent Verizon Communications are also military veterans. “We are very focused on having positive relationships with anybody in the military, whether they work for us or not,” McAdam says. “We do all those things, and this is something that Ivan, Denny and I pay attention to…There should be no penalty, nothing but positives for going off to protect the country.”
The message is clear to the company’s staff, too.
“My transition back into my current position was relatively seamless only in part to the ongoing support from my manager and fellow co-workers. For without them, my work load could have been daunting,” notes Christian Kant, an Iraq war veteran and inventory coordinator at Verizon Wireless. The self-described Marine “grunt,” and 10-year Verizon Wirleless employee, started working out with McAdam after they met at the corporate gym.
“Being a veteran, like Mr. McAdam, he had given up of his time, family and friends, and -- if it was necessary -- his life. I know that if an individual is willing to do that, then there is no one better suited to be in control of such a great and strong company as Verizon Wireless. Only in America.”

Verizon names McAdam president, COO







Verizon Communications on Monday named Lowell McAdam its president and chief operating officer, putting him in line to succeed CEO Ivan Seidenberg.
The appointment of McAdam, who was CEO of Verizon Wireless, highlights the growing importance of Verizon's mobile phone business, which has seen explosive growth in recent years as Americans get rid of plain old telephone lines into their homes. The housing downturn has also weighed on Verizon's fiber broadband Internet explanation plans.
Other executive changes:
CFO: Francis Shammo becomes chief financial officer (currently president of telecom and business). Shammo will succeed John Killian, who announced he will retire at the end of the year.
Verizon Wireless CEO: Daniel Mead, effective Oct. 1 (currently executive vice president and chief operating officer at Verizon Wireless).
Verizon Wireless COO: John Stratton, effective Oct. 1 (currently chief marketing officer).
Verizon has been a key figure in a debate over federal policy that would dictate how network operators like Verizon Communications' FiOs and Verizon Wireless can treat content on their networks. 
Verizon and Google want regulators and lawmakers to allow certain paid priority of network traffic that would, for example, allow better delivery of video games, HD video and medical services over broadband networks that could be charged at higher rates to consumers and businesses. The firms also proposed that lawmakers release wireless networks from rules that would force them to carry any application on phones that run on their networks.
photo: Lowell McAdam, president and chief operating officer, Verizon Communications  McAdam, 56, has overseen the explosive growth of the company's wireless business. Verizon Wireless, a joint venture between Verizon Communications and Vodafone, is the nation's largest wireless carrier with 91 million subscribers compared with 61 million subscribers in 2006. AT&T is close behind Verizon in terms of subscribers, and Sprint and T-Mobile trail as the third and fourth largest carriers.
"The Board's selection of Lowell to this key, central position underscores its commitment to reward success while working with me to prepare our company for an executive transition in the future," Seidenberg said in a news release.
McAdam will report directly to Seidenberg, 63, who has headed the company since it was founded in 2000. 
Seidenberg, 63, rose through the ranks of Verizon, starting as a cable splicer for New York Telecom and growing with the firm as it and other telecom giants consolidated their long distance and local businesses and transitioned into broadband Internet and wireless firms.

In your artile on new personnel at Verizon you wrote: "The housing downturn has also weighed on Verizon's fiber broadband Internet explanation plans."
"explanation plans"? Really? Didn't you mean "expansion plans."
I would expect better of a Washington Post writer AND her editors.
