Maker




There are lots of knifemakers making handmade knifes in their own shops, some just set up in their garage or a small outbuilding, and some with fine well equipped shops. Those who are making knives at the quality level demanded by our customers is much smaller. Finding makers who are producing the quality and can supply enough pieces for us to include in an A.G. Russell™ catalog is rare.
Keith Murr is a Northwest Arkansas maker who worked for a period of time in Bob Dozier's shop. The knife we are offering is his standard model 610 with surface Ram's Horn handle scales with a black fiber liner between the horn and the tang. The 3-5/8" drop point mirror polished blade is D2 at 60-61 Rc. The handle pins are stainless. Measures 8" tip to butt and weighs 5.1 oz. Includes a handmade brown leather pouch sheath. Made in the USA.
