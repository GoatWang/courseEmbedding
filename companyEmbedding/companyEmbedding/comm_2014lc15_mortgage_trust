FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 48 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 197 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which 
is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's 
assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's LTV ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.39X is slightly higher than 
the 2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.31X. The 
Moody's Stressed DSCR of 0.97X is greater than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92X. 




Moody's Trust LTV ratio of 106.4% is lower than the 
2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6%, 
but higher than most pools securitized during 2013. The dispersion 
of underlying credit is also worse than what was observed during 2013 
as five loans (11.1% of the pool balance) have a Moody's 
LTV ratio above 120%.




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level 
diversity when selecting a ratings approach.




With respect to loan level diversity, the pool's loan level 
(includes cross collateralized and cross defaulted loans) Herfindahl Index 
is 21. The transaction's loan level diversity is at the lower 
end of the band of Herfindahl scores found in most multi-borrower 
transactions issued since 2009. With respect to property level 
diversity, the pool's property level Herfindahl Index is 27. 
The pool contains twelve loans (29.8% of the pool balance) 
that are secured by multiple properties. Loans secured by multiple 
properties benefit from lower cash flow volatility given that excess cash 
flow from one property can be used to augment another's cash flow 
to meet debt service requirements. These loans also benefit from 
the pooling of equity from each underlying property.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is very strong at 2.09.




This deal has a super-senior Aaa class with 30% credit enhancement. 
Although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate 
holders provides additional protection against pool loss, the super-senior 
structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the super-senior 
class. If the support certificate were to take a loss, the 
loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. 
Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default 
in recognition that their loss-given default is higher. 
This adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across 
deals. The transaction was structured with additional subordination 
at class A-M to mitigate the potential increased severity to class 
A-M.




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating U.S. CMBS Conduit Transactions" published in September 
2000. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's analysis employs the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v2.64 
which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship and diversity. Moody's analysis 
also uses the CMBS IO calculator version 1.0 which references the 
following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the published 
methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit estimates; 
original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds 
the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and IO type corresponding 
to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
15%, and 23%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated junior Aaa class would be Aa1, Aa1, 
Aa3, respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended 
to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time; 
rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how 
the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial 
rating process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has 
not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact 
of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. 
Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer 
at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently 
verified by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement 
of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, 
inducement or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities 
or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection 
with any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account one or more third-party 
assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a 
neutral impact on the credit rating.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF360843.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




As the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes, Moody's 
quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors 
contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood 
of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moody's 
weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of 
the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

DBRS Confirms Ratings of COMM 2014-LC15 Mortgage Trust, Stable Trends


January 24, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed the ratings for all classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-LC15 (the Certificates) issued by COMM 2014-LC15 Mortgage Trust (the Trust) as follows: 

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf) 
-- Class X-B at AAA (sf) 
-- Class X-C at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-M at AAA (sf) 
-- Class B at AA (sf) 
-- Class PEZ at A (sf) 
-- Class C at A (sf) 
-- Class D at BBB (low) (sf) 
-- Class E at BB (low) (sf) 
-- Class F at B (sf)

All trends are Stable. DBRS does not rate the first loss piece, Class G. 

The rating confirmations reflect that the transaction�s overall current performance remains stable. The collateral consists of 48 fixed-rate loans secured by 197 commercial properties. As of the January 2017 remittance, all 48 loans remain in the pool with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $903 million, representing a collateral reduction of 2.7% since issuance as a result of scheduled loan amortization. The pool is concentrated by loan size, as the Top 10 loans represent 62.5% of the current pool balance. Two loans (9.0% of the pool) are structured with full interest-only (IO) terms, while an additional six loans (23.3% of the pool) have partial IO periods remaining, ranging from one month to 26 months. To date, 36 loans (76.1% of the pool) have reported partial-year 2016 net cash flow (NCF) figures, while the remaining loans (excluding one loan (0.5% of the pool)) have reported YE2015 NCF figures. According to the YE2015 NCFs, the transaction had a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and WA debt yield of 1.46 times (x) and 9.7%, respectively, compared with the DBRS underwritten (UW) figures of 1.37x and 9.1%, respectively. 

Based on the most recent cash flow reporting (ranging from YE2015 through partial-year 2016 financials), the Top 15 loans reported a WA DSCR of 1.46x compared with the DBRS UW figure of 1.32x, reflective of a WA amortizing NCF growth of 11.3%. There are four loans (14.3% of the pool) in the Top 15 exhibiting NCF declines compared with the DBRS UW figures, with declines ranging from 5.4% to 22.8%. These four loans include Akers Mill Square (Prospectus ID#5, 6.4% of the pool), GEM Hotel (Prospectus ID#10, 3.1% of the pool), The Dorchester at Forest Park (Prospectus ID#13, 2.7% of the pool) and Hilton Garden Inn Houston (Prospectus ID#14, 2.2% of the pool). 

As of the January 2017 remittance, there are two loans (1.1% of the pool) in special servicing and eight loans (13.3% of the pool) on the servicer�s watchlist. The two loans in special servicing -- the Holiday Inn Express Snyder (0.6% of the pool) and the La Quinta Inn & Suites Floresville (0.5% of the pool) loans -- are both secured by limited-service hotels located in heavily energy-dependent markets. Based on the most recent appraisals (May 2016 and August 2016), property values have dropped by approximately 77.0% since issuance. Of the eight loans on the servicer�s watchlist, five (9.7% of the pool) were flagged because of performance-related reasons. As of Q3 2016 financials, these loans had a WA DSCR of 1.08x compared with the WA DBRS UW figure of 1.34x, representing an 18.7% NCF decline.  

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted and specially serviced loans as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please log into DBRS CMBS IReports at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

I am very pleased with New American Funding for their effort to help lower the interest rate on my loan through refinance. They also have the best interest in their customers. I have set up the loan and refinanced twice with them and am very satisfied.

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.
