The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if Healthplans.com is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees and costs to Healthplans.com. If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. The arbitration will be conducted in the city of Los Angeles, California, but may proceed telephonically if the claimant so chooses.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.

The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration you must email us at legal@healthplans.com. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

Term Life Insurance
A Term Life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time, which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium. A Term Life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments.
This type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children, people with debt obligations and also home buyers. It can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy. The premiums are based on your age and your health status. Purchasing a new Term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues.
Term Life is a "death benefit only" policy that you buy for a specified length of time. Think of it like leasing a car: you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over, you return the car.
Term Life is referred to as "benefit only" insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as Whole Life, it carries no "cash surrender value". Because of this, Term Life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable. Young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check. It is ideal for families that are just starting out, or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected, but may not be able to afford, or desire a permanent life policy. However, understand that as a person ages over the period of the term, monthly premiums may increase.
It is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse, or for single people, even for children, just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered. There are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a Term Life policy can make up for the investment component of a Permanent Life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own.
The earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are, the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy.
Annual Renewable Term Life policies are those that are purchased year-by-year. The next year you do not have to prequalify. Simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate. Rates for Annual Renewable policies are at historic lows. A young healthy person can get $250,000.00 for only a few hundred dollars per year.
There are very good rates these days on Term Life. The premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term, usually 10,15, 20 or 30 years. It is not uncommon for a healthy non-smoking 40 year-old male to obtain a 20 or 30-year policy with a fixed premium of less than $30 per month.
So just how much Insurance should you buy? Many things factor into that answer, but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least 5-7 years of your present salary. If you have young children, make that around 10 years. So, if you make $50,000 a year that means at least $250,000 to $500,000 in coverage. Feel free to use our Life Insurance Calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances.
Term Life Insurance is an affordable life insurance product to ensure that your loved ones are protected in the event of your unexpected death, for a specific term period of time.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.
