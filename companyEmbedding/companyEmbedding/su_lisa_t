Early life and education[edit]
Lisa T. Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan in November[12][13] of 1969[2][5] and immigrated to the United States[2] around the age of 2.[12] Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children,[14] and she was seven when her father, a retired statistician, began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.[2] At a young age she aspired to be an engineer, explaining “I just had a great curiosity about how things worked.”[2] She was 10 when she began taking apart and then fixing her brother’s remote control cars,[15] and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II.[16] She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.[4]
Su began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering,[4] recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major.[2][14] During her freshman year she worked as an undergrad research assistant “manufacturing test silicon wafers for graduate students”[15] through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). The project, as well as her summer jobs at Analog Devices, made her interested in semiconductors.[4] She remained focused on the topic for the remainder of her education,[15] spending much of her time in labs designing and adjusting products.[2] After earning her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, she obtained her master’s degree from MIT in 1991. From 1990 to 1994[10] she studied for her PhD[2] under MIT advisor Dimitri Antoniadis.[4] MIT Technology Review reports that as a doctoral candidate, Su was “one of the first researchers to look into silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, a then unproven technique for increasing transistors’ efficiency by building them atop layers of an insulating material.”[4] She graduated with her PhD in electrical engineering[4][9] from MIT in 1994.[4]
Career[edit]
1994-1999: Texas Instruments and IBM R&D[edit]
In June 1994 Su became a member of the technical staff at Texas Instruments,[10] working in the company’s Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC)[9] until February 1995.[10] That month[6] IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics[17] and she was appointed vice president of IBM’s semiconductor research and development center.[6] During her time at IBM,[4] Su played a “critical role”[5] in developing the “recipe”[2] to make copper connections work with semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, “solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production.”[5] Working with various IBM design teams on the details of the device, Su explains that “my specialty was not in copper, but I migrated to where the problems were.”[4] The copper technology was launched in 1998,[5] resulting in new industry standards[17] and chips that were up to 20 percent faster than the conventional versions.[4][5]
2000-2007: IBM Emerging Products division[edit]
In 2000 Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM’s CEO. She subsequently took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that “I was basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group.”[4] As head and founder of IBM’s Emerging Products division, she ran a startup company and soon hired 10 employees to focus on biochips and “low-power and broadband semiconductors.” Their first product was a microprocessor that improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices.[5] MIT Technology Review named her a “Top Innovator Under 35” in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging Products.[17] Also through the division, she represented IBM in a collaboration to create next-generation chips with Sony and Toshiba. Ken Kutaragi charged the collaboration with “improving the performance of game machine processors by a factor of 1,000,” and Su’s team eventually came up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, afterwards used to power devices such as the Sony PlayStation 3. As of 2006 she continued to serve as vice president of the semiconductor research and development center at IBM,[4] holding the role until May 2007.[10]
2007-2011: Freescale Semiconductor[edit]
Su joined Freescale Semiconductor in June 2007[10][18] as chief technology officer (CTO), heading the company’s research and development[3][9] until August 2009.[10] From September 2008 until December 2011[10] she served as senior vice president and general manager of Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company’s embedded communications and applications processor business.[9][10] As head of the company’s networking-chip business,[17] EETimes credited her with helping Freescale get “its house in order,” with the company filing for an IPO in 2011.[3]
2012-2014: AMD appointments[edit]
Su became senior vice president and general manager at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in January 2012,[9] overseeing the company’s global business units[3][18] and the “end-to-end business execution” of AMD’s products.[9] Over the next two years she “played a prominent role”[18] in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC market, including working with Microsoft and Sony to place AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 game consoles[17]
On October 8, 2014, AMD announced Su’s appointment to president and CEO, replacing Rory Read.[6][19] Su stated that her plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology investments," streamlining the product line, and continuing to diversify, also asserting that she wanted to “simplify” the company and accelerate the development of new technology.[8] A number of analysts praised the appointment due to Su’s credentials, noting AMD was seeking growth in product areas where Su had “extensive experience.”[20]
2015-2016: AMD diversification[edit]

By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD’s sales came from non-PC markets such as video game consoles and embedded devices. When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC products.[2] In May 2015, Su and other AMD executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and “immersive platforms” markets.[21]
In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips,[22] and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles.[22][23] AMD’s share value spiked in July 2016 when AMD reported strong revenue growth. Fortune attributed the “impressive” statistic to Su, stating she “continues to execute on her comeback plan… key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have boosted results as well as a savvy deal to license server chip designs in China.”[23]
Directorships and authorship[edit]
She currently serves on the board of Analog Devices,[10] as well as the board the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).[9] As of 2016 she has published over 40 technical articles,[9] and she also co-wrote a book chapter on next-generation consumer electronics.[14]
Awards and honors[edit]

Su has been recognized with a number of awards throughout her career. In 2002 she was selected as one of the "Top 100 Young Innovators" by MIT Technology Review,[5][24] and the following year the YWCA gave her an award for outstanding achievement in business.[14] In 2009, Su was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), having published more than 40 technical articles. Su was named "2014 Executive of the Year" at the EE Times and EDN 2014 ACE Awards.[9]
In 2015, SFGate nominated her for their inaugural Visionary of the Year award, which “salutes leaders who strive to make the world a better place and drive social and economic change by employing new, innovative business models and practices.”[2] In 2016 she was named one of the "50 Most Powerful Women in Technology" by the National Diversity Council.[25] Also in 2016, she was named one of the "Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business" with the Pinnacle Award by the Asia American Business Development Center.[26] In 2017, Su was named one of the "World’s Greatest Leaders" by Fortune.[11]

Early life and education[edit]
Lisa T. Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan in November[12][13] of 1969[2][5] and immigrated to the United States[2] around the age of 2.[12] Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children,[14] and she was seven when her father, a retired statistician, began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.[2] At a young age she aspired to be an engineer, explaining “I just had a great curiosity about how things worked.”[2] She was 10 when she began taking apart and then fixing her brother’s remote control cars,[15] and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II.[16] She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.[4]
Su began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering,[4] recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major.[2][14] During her freshman year she worked as an undergrad research assistant “manufacturing test silicon wafers for graduate students”[15] through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). The project, as well as her summer jobs at Analog Devices, made her interested in semiconductors.[4] She remained focused on the topic for the remainder of her education,[15] spending much of her time in labs designing and adjusting products.[2] After earning her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, she obtained her master’s degree from MIT in 1991. From 1990 to 1994[10] she studied for her PhD[2] under MIT advisor Dimitri Antoniadis.[4] MIT Technology Review reports that as a doctoral candidate, Su was “one of the first researchers to look into silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, a then unproven technique for increasing transistors’ efficiency by building them atop layers of an insulating material.”[4] She graduated with her PhD in electrical engineering[4][9] from MIT in 1994.[4]
Career[edit]
1994-1999: Texas Instruments and IBM R&D[edit]
In June 1994 Su became a member of the technical staff at Texas Instruments,[10] working in the company’s Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC)[9] until February 1995.[10] That month[6] IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics[17] and she was appointed vice president of IBM’s semiconductor research and development center.[6] During her time at IBM,[4] Su played a “critical role”[5] in developing the “recipe”[2] to make copper connections work with semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, “solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production.”[5] Working with various IBM design teams on the details of the device, Su explains that “my specialty was not in copper, but I migrated to where the problems were.”[4] The copper technology was launched in 1998,[5] resulting in new industry standards[17] and chips that were up to 20 percent faster than the conventional versions.[4][5]
2000-2007: IBM Emerging Products division[edit]
In 2000 Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM’s CEO. She subsequently took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that “I was basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group.”[4] As head and founder of IBM’s Emerging Products division, she ran a startup company and soon hired 10 employees to focus on biochips and “low-power and broadband semiconductors.” Their first product was a microprocessor that improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices.[5] MIT Technology Review named her a “Top Innovator Under 35” in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging Products.[17] Also through the division, she represented IBM in a collaboration to create next-generation chips with Sony and Toshiba. Ken Kutaragi charged the collaboration with “improving the performance of game machine processors by a factor of 1,000,” and Su’s team eventually came up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, afterwards used to power devices such as the Sony PlayStation 3. As of 2006 she continued to serve as vice president of the semiconductor research and development center at IBM,[4] holding the role until May 2007.[10]
2007-2011: Freescale Semiconductor[edit]
Su joined Freescale Semiconductor in June 2007[10][18] as chief technology officer (CTO), heading the company’s research and development[3][9] until August 2009.[10] From September 2008 until December 2011[10] she served as senior vice president and general manager of Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company’s embedded communications and applications processor business.[9][10] As head of the company’s networking-chip business,[17] EETimes credited her with helping Freescale get “its house in order,” with the company filing for an IPO in 2011.[3]
2012-2014: AMD appointments[edit]
Su became senior vice president and general manager at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in January 2012,[9] overseeing the company’s global business units[3][18] and the “end-to-end business execution” of AMD’s products.[9] Over the next two years she “played a prominent role”[18] in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC market, including working with Microsoft and Sony to place AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 game consoles[17]
On October 8, 2014, AMD announced Su’s appointment to president and CEO, replacing Rory Read.[6][19] Su stated that her plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology investments," streamlining the product line, and continuing to diversify, also asserting that she wanted to “simplify” the company and accelerate the development of new technology.[8] A number of analysts praised the appointment due to Su’s credentials, noting AMD was seeking growth in product areas where Su had “extensive experience.”[20]
2015-2016: AMD diversification[edit]

By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD’s sales came from non-PC markets such as video game consoles and embedded devices. When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC products.[2] In May 2015, Su and other AMD executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and “immersive platforms” markets.[21]
In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips,[22] and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles.[22][23] AMD’s share value spiked in July 2016 when AMD reported strong revenue growth. Fortune attributed the “impressive” statistic to Su, stating she “continues to execute on her comeback plan… key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have boosted results as well as a savvy deal to license server chip designs in China.”[23]
Directorships and authorship[edit]
She currently serves on the board of Analog Devices,[10] as well as the board the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).[9] As of 2016 she has published over 40 technical articles,[9] and she also co-wrote a book chapter on next-generation consumer electronics.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Lisa T. Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan in November[12][13] of 1969[2][5] and immigrated to the United States[2] around the age of 2.[12] Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children,[14] and she was seven when her father, a retired statistician, began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.[2] At a young age she aspired to be an engineer, explaining “I just had a great curiosity about how things worked.”[2] She was 10 when she began taking apart and then fixing her brother’s remote control cars,[15] and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II.[16] She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.[4]
Su began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering,[4] recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major.[2][14] During her freshman year she worked as an undergrad research assistant “manufacturing test silicon wafers for graduate students”[15] through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). The project, as well as her summer jobs at Analog Devices, made her interested in semiconductors.[4] She remained focused on the topic for the remainder of her education,[15] spending much of her time in labs designing and adjusting products.[2] After earning her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, she obtained her master’s degree from MIT in 1991. From 1990 to 1994[10] she studied for her PhD[2] under MIT advisor Dimitri Antoniadis.[4] MIT Technology Review reports that as a doctoral candidate, Su was “one of the first researchers to look into silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, a then unproven technique for increasing transistors’ efficiency by building them atop layers of an insulating material.”[4] She graduated with her PhD in electrical engineering[4][9] from MIT in 1994.[4]
Career[edit]
1994-1999: Texas Instruments and IBM R&D[edit]
In June 1994 Su became a member of the technical staff at Texas Instruments,[10] working in the company’s Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC)[9] until February 1995.[10] That month[6] IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics[17] and she was appointed vice president of IBM’s semiconductor research and development center.[6] During her time at IBM,[4] Su played a “critical role”[5] in developing the “recipe”[2] to make copper connections work with semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, “solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production.”[5] Working with various IBM design teams on the details of the device, Su explains that “my specialty was not in copper, but I migrated to where the problems were.”[4] The copper technology was launched in 1998,[5] resulting in new industry standards[17] and chips that were up to 20 percent faster than the conventional versions.[4][5]
2000-2007: IBM Emerging Products division[edit]
In 2000 Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM’s CEO. She subsequently took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that “I was basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group.”[4] As head and founder of IBM’s Emerging Products division, she ran a startup company and soon hired 10 employees to focus on biochips and “low-power and broadband semiconductors.” Their first product was a microprocessor that improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices.[5] MIT Technology Review named her a “Top Innovator Under 35” in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging Products.[17] Also through the division, she represented IBM in a collaboration to create next-generation chips with Sony and Toshiba. Ken Kutaragi charged the collaboration with “improving the performance of game machine processors by a factor of 1,000,” and Su’s team eventually came up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, afterwards used to power devices such as the Sony PlayStation 3. As of 2006 she continued to serve as vice president of the semiconductor research and development center at IBM,[4] holding the role until May 2007.[10]
2007-2011: Freescale Semiconductor[edit]
Su joined Freescale Semiconductor in June 2007[10][18] as chief technology officer (CTO), heading the company’s research and development[3][9] until August 2009.[10] From September 2008 until December 2011[10] she served as senior vice president and general manager of Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company’s embedded communications and applications processor business.[9][10] As head of the company’s networking-chip business,[17] EETimes credited her with helping Freescale get “its house in order,” with the company filing for an IPO in 2011.[3]
2012-2014: AMD appointments[edit]
Su became senior vice president and general manager at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in January 2012,[9] overseeing the company’s global business units[3][18] and the “end-to-end business execution” of AMD’s products.[9] Over the next two years she “played a prominent role”[18] in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC market, including working with Microsoft and Sony to place AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 game consoles[17]
On October 8, 2014, AMD announced Su’s appointment to president and CEO, replacing Rory Read.[6][19] Su stated that her plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology investments," streamlining the product line, and continuing to diversify, also asserting that she wanted to “simplify” the company and accelerate the development of new technology.[8] A number of analysts praised the appointment due to Su’s credentials, noting AMD was seeking growth in product areas where Su had “extensive experience.”[20]
2015-2016: AMD diversification[edit]

By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD’s sales came from non-PC markets such as video game consoles and embedded devices. When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC products.[2] In May 2015, Su and other AMD executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and “immersive platforms” markets.[21]
In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips,[22] and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles.[22][23] AMD’s share value spiked in July 2016 when AMD reported strong revenue growth. Fortune attributed the “impressive” statistic to Su, stating she “continues to execute on her comeback plan… key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have boosted results as well as a savvy deal to license server chip designs in China.”[23]
Directorships and authorship[edit]
She currently serves on the board of Analog Devices,[10] as well as the board the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).[9] As of 2016 she has published over 40 technical articles,[9] and she also co-wrote a book chapter on next-generation consumer electronics.[14]
Awards and honors[edit]

Su has been recognized with a number of awards throughout her career. In 2002 she was selected as one of the "Top 100 Young Innovators" by MIT Technology Review,[5][24] and the following year the YWCA gave her an award for outstanding achievement in business.[14] In 2009, Su was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), having published more than 40 technical articles. Su was named "2014 Executive of the Year" at the EE Times and EDN 2014 ACE Awards.[9]
In 2015, SFGate nominated her for their inaugural Visionary of the Year award, which “salutes leaders who strive to make the world a better place and drive social and economic change by employing new, innovative business models and practices.”[2] In 2016 she was named one of the "50 Most Powerful Women in Technology" by the National Diversity Council.[25] Also in 2016, she was named one of the "Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business" with the Pinnacle Award by the Asia American Business Development Center.[26] In 2017, Su was named one of the "World’s Greatest Leaders" by Fortune.[11]

Early life and education[edit]
Lisa T. Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan in November[12][13] of 1969[2][5] and immigrated to the United States[2] around the age of 2.[12] Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children,[14] and she was seven when her father, a retired statistician, began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.[2] At a young age she aspired to be an engineer, explaining “I just had a great curiosity about how things worked.”[2] She was 10 when she began taking apart and then fixing her brother’s remote control cars,[15] and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II.[16] She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.[4]

In June 1994 Su became a member of the technical staff at Texas Instruments,[10] working in the company’s Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC)[9] until February 1995.[10] That month[6] IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics[17] and she was appointed vice president of IBM’s semiconductor research and development center.[6] During her time at IBM,[4] Su played a “critical role”[5] in developing the “recipe”[2] to make copper connections work with semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, “solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production.”[5] Working with various IBM design teams on the details of the device, Su explains that “my specialty was not in copper, but I migrated to where the problems were.”[4] The copper technology was launched in 1998,[5] resulting in new industry standards[17] and chips that were up to 20 percent faster than the conventional versions.[4][5]
2000-2007: IBM Emerging Products division[edit]
In 2000 Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM’s CEO. She subsequently took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that “I was basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group.”[4] As head and founder of IBM’s Emerging Products division, she ran a startup company and soon hired 10 employees to focus on biochips and “low-power and broadband semiconductors.” Their first product was a microprocessor that improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices.[5] MIT Technology Review named her a “Top Innovator Under 35” in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging Products.[17] Also through the division, she represented IBM in a collaboration to create next-generation chips with Sony and Toshiba. Ken Kutaragi charged the collaboration with “improving the performance of game machine processors by a factor of 1,000,” and Su’s team eventually came up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, afterwards used to power devices such as the Sony PlayStation 3. As of 2006 she continued to serve as vice president of the semiconductor research and development center at IBM,[4] holding the role until May 2007.[10]
2007-2011: Freescale Semiconductor[edit]
Su joined Freescale Semiconductor in June 2007[10][18] as chief technology officer (CTO), heading the company’s research and development[3][9] until August 2009.[10] From September 2008 until December 2011[10] she served as senior vice president and general manager of Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company’s embedded communications and applications processor business.[9][10] As head of the company’s networking-chip business,[17] EETimes credited her with helping Freescale get “its house in order,” with the company filing for an IPO in 2011.[3]
2012-2014: AMD appointments[edit]
Su became senior vice president and general manager at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in January 2012,[9] overseeing the company’s global business units[3][18] and the “end-to-end business execution” of AMD’s products.[9] Over the next two years she “played a prominent role”[18] in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC market, including working with Microsoft and Sony to place AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 game consoles[17]
On October 8, 2014, AMD announced Su’s appointment to president and CEO, replacing Rory Read.[6][19] Su stated that her plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology investments," streamlining the product line, and continuing to diversify, also asserting that she wanted to “simplify” the company and accelerate the development of new technology.[8] A number of analysts praised the appointment due to Su’s credentials, noting AMD was seeking growth in product areas where Su had “extensive experience.”[20]
2015-2016: AMD diversification[edit]

By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD’s sales came from non-PC markets such as video game consoles and embedded devices. When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC products.[2] In May 2015, Su and other AMD executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and “immersive platforms” markets.[21]
In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips,[22] and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles.[22][23] AMD’s share value spiked in July 2016 when AMD reported strong revenue growth. Fortune attributed the “impressive” statistic to Su, stating she “continues to execute on her comeback plan… key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have boosted results as well as a savvy deal to license server chip designs in China.”[23]
Directorships and authorship[edit]
She currently serves on the board of Analog Devices,[10] as well as the board the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).[9] As of 2016 she has published over 40 technical articles,[9] and she also co-wrote a book chapter on next-generation consumer electronics.[14]
Awards and honors[edit]

Su has been recognized with a number of awards throughout her career. In 2002 she was selected as one of the "Top 100 Young Innovators" by MIT Technology Review,[5][24] and the following year the YWCA gave her an award for outstanding achievement in business.[14] In 2009, Su was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), having published more than 40 technical articles. Su was named "2014 Executive of the Year" at the EE Times and EDN 2014 ACE Awards.[9]
In 2015, SFGate nominated her for their inaugural Visionary of the Year award, which “salutes leaders who strive to make the world a better place and drive social and economic change by employing new, innovative business models and practices.”[2] In 2016 she was named one of the "50 Most Powerful Women in Technology" by the National Diversity Council.[25] Also in 2016, she was named one of the "Outstanding 50 Asian Americans in Business" with the Pinnacle Award by the Asia American Business Development Center.[26] In 2017, Su was named one of the "World’s Greatest Leaders" by Fortune.[11]

Early life and education[edit]
Lisa T. Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan in November[12][13] of 1969[2][5] and immigrated to the United States[2] around the age of 2.[12] Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children,[14] and she was seven when her father, a retired statistician, began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.[2] At a young age she aspired to be an engineer, explaining “I just had a great curiosity about how things worked.”[2] She was 10 when she began taking apart and then fixing her brother’s remote control cars,[15] and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II.[16] She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.[4]
Su began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering,[4] recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major.[2][14] During her freshman year she worked as an undergrad research assistant “manufacturing test silicon wafers for graduate students”[15] through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). The project, as well as her summer jobs at Analog Devices, made her interested in semiconductors.[4] She remained focused on the topic for the remainder of her education,[15] spending much of her time in labs designing and adjusting products.[2] After earning her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, she obtained her master’s degree from MIT in 1991. From 1990 to 1994[10] she studied for her PhD[2] under MIT advisor Dimitri Antoniadis.[4] MIT Technology Review reports that as a doctoral candidate, Su was “one of the first researchers to look into silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, a then unproven technique for increasing transistors’ efficiency by building them atop layers of an insulating material.”[4] She graduated with her PhD in electrical engineering[4][9] from MIT in 1994.[4]
Career[edit]
1994-1999: Texas Instruments and IBM R&D[edit]
In June 1994 Su became a member of the technical staff at Texas Instruments,[10] working in the company’s Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC)[9] until February 1995.[10] That month[6] IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics[17] and she was appointed vice president of IBM’s semiconductor research and development center.[6] During her time at IBM,[4] Su played a “critical role”[5] in developing the “recipe”[2] to make copper connections work with semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, “solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production.”[5] Working with various IBM design teams on the details of the device, Su explains that “my specialty was not in copper, but I migrated to where the problems were.”[4] The copper technology was launched in 1998,[5] resulting in new industry standards[17] and chips that were up to 20 percent faster than the conventional versions.[4][5]
2000-2007: IBM Emerging Products division[edit]
In 2000 Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM’s CEO. She subsequently took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that “I was basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group.”[4] As head and founder of IBM’s Emerging Products division, she ran a startup company and soon hired 10 employees to focus on biochips and “low-power and broadband semiconductors.” Their first product was a microprocessor that improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices.[5] MIT Technology Review named her a “Top Innovator Under 35” in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging Products.[17] Also through the division, she represented IBM in a collaboration to create next-generation chips with Sony and Toshiba. Ken Kutaragi charged the collaboration with “improving the performance of game machine processors by a factor of 1,000,” and Su’s team eventually came up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, afterwards used to power devices such as the Sony PlayStation 3. As of 2006 she continued to serve as vice president of the semiconductor research and development center at IBM,[4] holding the role until May 2007.[10]
2007-2011: Freescale Semiconductor[edit]
Su joined Freescale Semiconductor in June 2007[10][18] as chief technology officer (CTO), heading the company’s research and development[3][9] until August 2009.[10] From September 2008 until December 2011[10] she served as senior vice president and general manager of Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company’s embedded communications and applications processor business.[9][10] As head of the company’s networking-chip business,[17] EETimes credited her with helping Freescale get “its house in order,” with the company filing for an IPO in 2011.[3]
2012-2014: AMD appointments[edit]
Su became senior vice president and general manager at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in January 2012,[9] overseeing the company’s global business units[3][18] and the “end-to-end business execution” of AMD’s products.[9] Over the next two years she “played a prominent role”[18] in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC market, including working with Microsoft and Sony to place AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 game consoles[17]
On October 8, 2014, AMD announced Su’s appointment to president and CEO, replacing Rory Read.[6][19] Su stated that her plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology investments," streamlining the product line, and continuing to diversify, also asserting that she wanted to “simplify” the company and accelerate the development of new technology.[8] A number of analysts praised the appointment due to Su’s credentials, noting AMD was seeking growth in product areas where Su had “extensive experience.”[20]
2015-2016: AMD diversification[edit]




AMD CEO Lisa Su in June 2015.


By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD’s sales came from non-PC markets such as video game consoles and embedded devices. When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC products.[2] In May 2015, Su and other AMD executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and “immersive platforms” markets.[21]
In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips,[22] and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles.[22][23] AMD’s share value spiked in July 2016 when AMD reported strong revenue growth. Fortune attributed the “impressive” statistic to Su, stating she “continues to execute on her comeback plan… key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have boosted results as well as a savvy deal to license server chip designs in China.”[23]
Directorships and authorship[edit]
She currently serves on the board of Analog Devices,[10] as well as the board the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).[9] As of 2016 she has published over 40 technical articles,[9] and she also co-wrote a book chapter on next-generation consumer electronics.[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Lisa T. Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan in November[12][13] of 1969[2][5] and immigrated to the United States[2] around the age of 2.[12] Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children,[14] and she was seven when her father, a retired statistician, began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.[2] At a young age she aspired to be an engineer, explaining “I just had a great curiosity about how things worked.”[2] She was 10 when she began taking apart and then fixing her brother’s remote control cars,[15] and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II.[16] She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.[4]
Su began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering,[4] recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major.[2][14] During her freshman year she worked as an undergrad research assistant “manufacturing test silicon wafers for graduate students”[15] through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). The project, as well as her summer jobs at Analog Devices, made her interested in semiconductors.[4] She remained focused on the topic for the remainder of her education,[15] spending much of her time in labs designing and adjusting products.[2] After earning her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, she obtained her master’s degree from MIT in 1991. From 1990 to 1994[10] she studied for her PhD[2] under MIT advisor Dimitri Antoniadis.[4] MIT Technology Review reports that as a doctoral candidate, Su was “one of the first researchers to look into silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, a then unproven technique for increasing transistors’ efficiency by building them atop layers of an insulating material.”[4] She graduated with her PhD in electrical engineering[4][9] from MIT in 1994.[4]
Career[edit]
1994-1999: Texas Instruments and IBM R&D[edit]
In June 1994 Su became a member of the technical staff at Texas Instruments,[10] working in the company’s Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC)[9] until February 1995.[10] That month[6] IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics[17] and she was appointed vice president of IBM’s semiconductor research and development center.[6] During her time at IBM,[4] Su played a “critical role”[5] in developing the “recipe”[2] to make copper connections work with semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, “solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production.”[5] Working with various IBM design teams on the details of the device, Su explains that “my specialty was not in copper, but I migrated to where the problems were.”[4] The copper technology was launched in 1998,[5] resulting in new industry standards[17] and chips that were up to 20 percent faster than the conventional versions.[4][5]
2000-2007: IBM Emerging Products division[edit]
In 2000 Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM’s CEO. She subsequently took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that “I was basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group.”[4] As head and founder of IBM’s Emerging Products division, she ran a startup company and soon hired 10 employees to focus on biochips and “low-power and broadband semiconductors.” Their first product was a microprocessor that improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices.[5] MIT Technology Review named her a “Top Innovator Under 35” in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging Products.[17] Also through the division, she represented IBM in a collaboration to create next-generation chips with Sony and Toshiba. Ken Kutaragi charged the collaboration with “improving the performance of game machine processors by a factor of 1,000,” and Su’s team eventually came up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, afterwards used to power devices such as the Sony PlayStation 3. As of 2006 she continued to serve as vice president of the semiconductor research and development center at IBM,[4] holding the role until May 2007.[10]
2007-2011: Freescale Semiconductor[edit]
Su joined Freescale Semiconductor in June 2007[10][18] as chief technology officer (CTO), heading the company’s research and development[3][9] until August 2009.[10] From September 2008 until December 2011[10] she served as senior vice president and general manager of Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company’s embedded communications and applications processor business.[9][10] As head of the company’s networking-chip business,[17] EETimes credited her with helping Freescale get “its house in order,” with the company filing for an IPO in 2011.[3]
2012-2014: AMD appointments[edit]
Su became senior vice president and general manager at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in January 2012,[9] overseeing the company’s global business units[3][18] and the “end-to-end business execution” of AMD’s products.[9] Over the next two years she “played a prominent role”[18] in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC market, including working with Microsoft and Sony to place AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 game consoles[17]
On October 8, 2014, AMD announced Su’s appointment to president and CEO, replacing Rory Read.[6][19] Su stated that her plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology investments," streamlining the product line, and continuing to diversify, also asserting that she wanted to “simplify” the company and accelerate the development of new technology.[8] A number of analysts praised the appointment due to Su’s credentials, noting AMD was seeking growth in product areas where Su had “extensive experience.”[20]
2015-2016: AMD diversification[edit]




AMD CEO Lisa Su in June 2015.


By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD’s sales came from non-PC markets such as video game consoles and embedded devices. When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC products.[2] In May 2015, Su and other AMD executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and “immersive platforms” markets.[21]
In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips,[22] and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles.[22][23] AMD’s share value spiked in July 2016 when AMD reported strong revenue growth. Fortune attributed the “impressive” statistic to Su, stating she “continues to execute on her comeback plan… key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have boosted results as well as a savvy deal to license server chip designs in China.”[23]
Directorships and authorship[edit]
She currently serves on the board of Analog Devices,[10] as well as the board the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).[9] As of 2016 she has published over 40 technical articles,[9] and she also co-wrote a book chapter on next-generation consumer electronics.[14]

AMD's new CEO Lisa Su says her company won't walk in Intel's shadow (interview)

Dean Takahashi@deantak October 9, 2014 6:15 AM



Above: Lisa Su, CEO of AMDImage Credit: AMD 





Yesterday, Advanced Micro Devices, one of the biggest chip-design companies in the world, appointed Lisa Su as its president and chief executive officer. She is the latest female top executive at a major Silicon Valley tech company, and she is the first female boss at the 45-year-old company that had $5.3 billion in revenue last year.
Su, 44, succeeds Rory Read, 52, who stepped down in a surprise announcement. She has been at AMD for just a few years, but in that time, the company has executed on its strategy to grow its business in new markets. In 2012, 91 percent of its business was in the traditional PC microprocessor and graphics chips. Now about 40 percent of revenues come from markets such as game consoles, dense servers, and embedded devices.
AMD is still No. 2 in PC processors to Intel, but Su told us in an interview that AMD won’t define itself in somebody else’s shadow. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview.
Above: AMD CEO Lisa SuImage Credit: AMD
VentureBeat: What are your plans as CEO?

Lisa Su: My focus has always been on running the business and making sure that we’re building the right products. As CEO, I’m looking at opportunities to streamline and improve our business operations.
VB: AMD has always had tough competition from Intel. How do you look at that, given that you have a chance to start a new era here?
Su: My view of AMD is that we have a tremendous set of technology assets, people, capability, customer relationships. We’re not going to define ourselves in somebody else’s shadow. We have great technology assets that we can apply across a number of different markets. In the PC business, we obviously compete against Intel, but in other businesses, as we go into embedded and semi-custom, it’s a different playing field.
VB: What are some things that you could say to address anybody who might have a concern about a transition period ahead? People may be worried that AMD’s financial performance could take a hit during a transition.
Su: I’ve been with this company for almost three years. I know it very well. We’ve always said that this is a multistage transformation. The first two steps were focused on resetting and restructuring the company. As we go into this third phase, it’s about technology and technology bets. We’re in this for the long term — certainly I’m in this for the long term — to build out great products and create a great franchise for the company. Those are the key beats.
VB: How do you feel about being the first woman to become CEO of AMD, and one of the few women holding that office in a big Silicon Valley company?
Su: I’m obviously honored and excited to accept that vision. Being CEO of AMD is a tremendous opportunity to influence the industry and influence the future of computing. I’m very excited and enthusiastic about all that’s in front of us.
VB: Diversity in Silicon Valley seems like it’s more on the radar in recent months, doesn’t it?
Su: One of the key things is, when you look at semiconductor companies, it’s all about experience. I’ve spent my entire career in semiconductors. From an opportunity standpoint, there’s a lot of opportunity to move this company forward.
VB: You’re still a rare example in the industry. Hopefully that won’t be the case as much going forward.
Su: Certainly there’s an opportunity to improve, no doubt.

Lisa Su, 32
Hardware
IBM


People often ask Lisa Su why she works for IBM—after all, aren’t startups where the glamour is? Su’s response: “I can run a group that’s like a startup, yet I have the resources available at IBM.” Her Emerging Products group focuses on low-power and broadband semiconductors as well as biochips. Its first product is a microprocessor that improves battery life in handheld assistants and cell phones. Su hired the group’s 10 employees and says their role is to develop broadband products that will “give my mom instant, unlimited access to information, anytime, anywhere, in any form.” After joining IBM in 1995,Su, who has a PhD in electrical engineering, played a critical role in integrating copper connections into semiconductor chips, solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production. The technology, unveiled in 1998,led to chips that were 10 to 20 percent faster than those with conventional aluminum connections. Su showed she had management acumen and was allowed to start Emerging Products. “Lisa became an IBM executive in five years,” says colleague Scottie Ginn, “quicker than anyone I’ve ever seen.”
