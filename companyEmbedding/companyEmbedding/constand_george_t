George T. ConstandChief Technical & Quality Officer

George T. Constand is Chief Technical & Quality Officer of Dana Holding Corporation. Constand joined Dana in 2005 as vice president of global engineering for the company’s light axle operations.
He joined Dana after a 20-year career at Visteon Corporation and Ford Motor Company. At Visteon, he served as director of chassis driveline engineering and, prior to that position, as director of quality for North America and Asia-Pacific. As Visteon’s top quality leader, Constand helped implement standardized processes throughout its global manufacturing base. As a plant manager at Ford, he ran a major axle, driveshaft, and transmission operation in Sterling Heights, Mich. His experience also included positions of increasing responsibility in the areas of manufacturing engineering and planning, product design and engineering, program launches, and the development and management of technical centers. In these roles, Constand became a Six Sigma Champion and an active leader of lean manufacturing techniques and stage-gate development processes. His career at Visteon and Ford included management positions internationally as well, particularly in Europe.
Constand earned a bachelor’s degree and Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan.
