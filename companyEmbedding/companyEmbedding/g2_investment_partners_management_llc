G2 Mission Statement






















G2 (\jē-ˈtü-\) n. proprietary intelligence
Who are we?• Investment company that creates partnerships with asset operators rather than fund managers.• Provide appropriate architecture and strategic capital to our operating partners.• Align incentives and interests with operators to promote long term partnerships.• Focus on enterprise value and tax deferral benefits that accrue to companies.• Invest in assets of need such as real estate and energy, which have infinite duration and asymmetrical return.• Apply the teachings of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to assets that should be owned for decades.
We believe that fundamental outperformance can only occur in one of three ways:1) Hyper growth industries - innovation2) Mispriced assets3) Creating better financial architecture “Structural Alpha”
The end result is that G2 is a collection of operators who invest across a diverse set of assets of need. We receive equity in each company that we invest in or create, which enables us to offer co-investments to our shareholding partners.

About Us

ApproachWe get our name, “G2”, from a military term which indicates the gathering of intelligence in the field. On the ground research is fundamental to our investment approach, as we believe it assists us in seeking to profit from the early identification of compelling small-stock investment. These stocks, in our opinion, are often overlooked or underappreciated by larger firms since they lack trading volumes or research coverage.    In addition to research, risk management is integral to our portfolio construction process.  We employ what we believe to be rigorous controls on both the security and portfolio levels. Monthly capital statements are sent to our investors generally within ten business days after month end. In addition, monthly letters and monthly statistical information are sent to all investors. The monthly letters provide a qualitative discussion of G2’s portfolio positioning, outlook and performance for the relevant month. 

Our FirmFounded by Josh Goldberg in 2009, G2 pursues an opportunistic long-short equity strategy focused on small-mid cap stocks. We see our investors as true partners and believe transparency is key to maintaining a strong relationship.  Our aim is to generate attractive investment returns for investors over the intermediate and long-term through strict adherence to our investment and organizational principles. We seek to make G2 a long-term, sustainable business and are committed to attracting talented professionals and using appropriate resources to support G2’s investment program and the operational and non-investment needs of the business and its investors.

​​G2’s research process is primarily focused on variant perception. Variant perception refers to the process of taking a view that is meaningfully different from market consensus in order to anticipate investment opportunities ahead of the market. G2 seeks to identify companies that are on the cusp of earnings surprises, both positive and negative.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
