Fluor Corporation is a multinational engineering and construction firm headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries in the following areas: oil and gas, industrial and infrastructure, government and power. It is the largest engineering & construction company in the Fortune 500 rankings and lists 149th overall in the same rankings.
Fluor was founded in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, predominantly by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for the oil and gas industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil and gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.
In the 1990s, Fluor introduced new services like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects and other environmental work became a significant portion of Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]




Headquarters of Fluor Bros Construction in the early 1900s


Fluor Corporation's predecessor, Rudolph Fluor & Brother, was founded in 1890 by John Simon Fluor[2] and his two brothers in Oshkosh, Wisconsin[3] as a saw and paper mill.[2] John Fluor acted as its president[2] and contributed $100 in personal savings to help the business get started.[4] The company was renamed Fluor Bros. Construction Co. in 1903.[2]
In 1912 John Fluor moved to Santa Ana, California for health reasons without his brothers[5] and founded Fluor Corporation out of his garage[6] under the name Fluor Construction Company.[5][7] By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars)[2] and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor.[8] A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated.[2] John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929.[8] In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation.[2] By the 1930s, Fluor had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.[4][9] Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war Fluor manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for a substantial portion of high-octane gasoline production in the United States.[4] A Gas-Gasoline division of Fluor was created in Houston in 1948.[2]
Fluor's headquarters were moved to Los Angeles in 1940 in order to be closer to its oil and gas clients, before moving again to Orange County, California in the 1960s due to concerns about the cost of living and traffic.[6] John Simon Fluor died in 1944. He was succeeded by his son Peter Fluor, who died three years later. Peter was followed by Shirley Meserve (1947) and Donald Darnell (1949), then John Simon "Si" Fluor Jr. in 1952 and J. Robert (Bob) Fluor in 1962.[2][10] Fluor was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1950s.[11] In 1961 Fluor acquired an interest in construction, design and contracting firm William J. Moran.[12]
Diversification and restructuring[edit]
Fluor diversified its business more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling and it started a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968[2] and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s.[11] Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America[2] and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction.[10][13] In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it.[6] The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.[2]
In 1977, Fluor acquired Daniel International Corporation.[14] Fluor's business had become predominantly international, while Daniel International's $1 billion construction business was mostly domestic. The acquisition allowed the company to use union labor at Fluor, or non-union labor at Daniel, for each client.[11] Fluor made a $2.9 billion acquisition of a zinc, gold, lead and coal mining operation, St. Joe Minerals, in 1981[15] after a bidding competition for the business with Seagram.[16][17]
By the 1980s, Fluor's primary business was building large refineries, petrochemical plants, oil pipelines and other facilities for the gas and oil industry,[18] especially in the Middle East.[18][19] By 1981, Fluor's staff had grown to 29,000 and revenue, backlog, and profits had each increased more than 30 percent over the prior year.[20] However, by 1984 the mining operation was causing heavy losses[21] and the oil and gas industry Fluor served was in a worldwide recession[22] due to declining oil prices.[18][23] From 1981 to 1984, Fluor's backlog went from $16 billion to $4 billion.[18] In 1985 it reported $633 million in losses.[24] David Tappan took Bob Fluor's place as CEO in 1984 after Bob died from cancer[18][25][26] and led a difficult restructuring.[27]
The company sold $750 million in assets, including Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, in order to pay $1 billion in debt.[26][27] Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000.[18] In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations.[2][28] Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel.[2] By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits[29] and $108.5 million by 1989.[26] By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries.[2] Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States.[18][22] Fluor's international revenues rebounded.[30] Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped down at the end of 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.[22][31]
Recent history[edit]
During the restructuring, Fluor's core construction and engineering work was diversified into 30 industries including food, paper manufacturers, prisons and others to reduce its vulnerability to market changes in the oil and gas market.[18][22] In the 1990s, the company tried to change its image, calling itself a "diversified technical services" firm.[18][32] It started offering equipment rentals, staffing services, and financing for construction projects.[18][32] The company began offering environmental cleanup and pollution control services, which grew to half of its new business by 1992.[21] Fluor's mining business grew from $300 million in 1990 to $1 billion in 1994.[33] The US government passed environmental regulations in 1995 that led to growth for the Massey Coal Co. business, because it had large reserves of low-sulfur coal.[34] In 1992, Fluor sold its ownership of Doe Run Company, the world's largest producer of refined lead, which was losing money at the time due to declining lead prices.[35] By 1993, Fluor had revenues of $4.17 billion and 22,000 staff.[2]
In 1997, Fluor's revenues fell almost 50 percent, in part due to the Asian financial crisis[36] and a decrease in overseas business.[30][37] Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project[38] in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project.[39] Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing.[2] In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called Fluor Signature Services.[36][40]
In January 1998 McCraw (age 63) resigned after being diagnosed with bladder cancer[41][42] and was replaced by former Shell President, Philip J. Carroll.[43] That same year, IT Group purchased a 54 percent interest in Fluor Daniel GTI, Fluor's environmental division, for $36.3 million.[2] Two years later, the coal mining operation under the A.T. Massey Coal Co. name (part of St. Joe) was spun off into its own business.[36] In 2001, Fluor's four primary subsidiaries were consolidated into a single Fluor Corporation.[10] In 2002 Alan Boeckmann was appointed as the CEO, followed by David Seaton in 2011.[10] In 2005, Fluor's headquarters were moved to the Las Colinas area in Irving, Texas.[9]
In December 2015 Fluor announced that it would take over Dutch industrial services company Stork.[44] The acquisition of this company, which modifies and maintains large power plants, was completed in March 2016, in a stock purchase worth $755 million.[45]
Organization[edit]
Fluor is the largest construction and engineering company in the Fortune 500[46] and the 149th largest company in the ranking overall.[47] It has offices in 25 countries. Many of Fluor's operations are located near natural resources, such as uranium in Canada, oil reserves in the Middle East and mines in Australia. About 30 percent of Fluor's revenues are based in the United States as of 2011.[48] The Fluor family owns a 3.5 percent interest in the company, while employees own six percent through its profit-sharing program.[11]
Fluor's Board of Directors has 12 "Independent Directors" and the CEO. The Independent Directors elect a Lead Independent Director every three years that acts as a liaison to the CEO.[49] Each Independent Director is on two or more of four committees: audit, executive, governance, and organization & compensation.[50] Directors serve a three-year term and are elected by shareholders.[49] Corporate officers, such as the CEO, are elected each year by a vote of the board.[51]
Fluor received an "A" ranking in Transparency International's 2012 anti-corruption study.[52] The company hosts online and in-person anti-corruption training sessions for staff and operates an ethics hotline. Former CEO Alan Boeckmann helped create the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI), whereby companies agree to a set of ethics principles.[53] A MarketLine SWOT analysis said Fluor's environmental work "enhances the company's brand image," while often lengthy and unpredictable legal disputes "tarnish the company's brand image and will erode customer confidence."[48]
According to the Los Angeles Times, Fluor is a "major corporate citizen" that supports local charities and civic groups.[43] It started the Fluor Foundation for its charitable work in 1952 and Fluor Cares in 2010.[10] The company started the largest employer-sponsored apprenticeship program in California with a four-year program for designers in 1982.[54] Fluor operates a virtual college for employees called Fluor University.[55]
Services[edit]




A Fluor construction site in Shuaiba, Kuwait


Fluor is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries.[48] Its subsidiaries provide engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management services. The company has also developed pollution control products, such as the Econamine lineup of carbon capture products.[48] According to Fluor's 2014 annual report, 67 percent of its work backlog is from the oil and gas industry.[56] According to the company's website, Fluor's work includes designing and building power plants, petrochemical factories, mining facilities, roads and bridges, government buildings, and manufacturing facilities. The company also performs nuclear cleanup and other services.[57]
Separate teams of experts, procurement staff, project managers and workers are provided for large projects that are supported by a centralized administrative staff. Fluor has trained more than 100,000 craft workers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, Pakistan, Kuwait and other countries, where the needed labor skills weren't available locally.[11] It may also serve clients through a joint venture with another construction firm when a local infrastructure or niche expertise is needed.[48]
Fluor acquired shares of Genetech Inc. in 1981[58] and it bought a 10 percent interest in a smelter and refinery facility in Gresik, Indonesia in 1995 for $550 million. In 1994, it invested $650 million with the Beacon Group Energy Investment fund to finance energy projects.[34] Fluor also has a majority interest in NuScale LLC., which is developing a new type of 45-megawatt nuclear reactor called a small modular reactor (SMR).[59]
Notable projects[edit]




A Fluor "Buddha Tower" water cooling tower from the early 1900s


Fluor's first projects were in constructing and grading roads, but by the 1920s it was known for building public facilities, industrial complexes[7] and serving a growing California oil and gas industry.[4][6] It started building office and meter manufacturing facilities for the Southern California Gas Company in 1915, as well as a compressor station for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company in 1919.[8] Fluor built the first "Buddha Tower" in 1921[7][8] in Signal Hill, California, for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company.[10] The Buddha Tower was a design of water-cooling tower named after the Buddha temples they resemble.[7][8] The following year Fluor was awarded a contract by Richfield Oil to build a 10,000-gallon-per-day gasoline plant.[11]
Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor expanded Fluor's business outside of California in the 1930s.[8] It built refineries in Texas,[11] as well as oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company.[8][10] Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world.[33] In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project.[7][9] It built an expansion of the Dhahran Aire Force Base in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s[7] and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.[11]
In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor built the first all-hydrogen refinery in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company.[7] It also constructed pumps and ports[11] for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,[7] which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska,[10] and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas on the island of Java in Indonesia.[2] In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.[11] In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served more than half of the world's government-owned oil companies.[11]




Fluor workers at a radiation cleanup site in Ohio


Fluor has been working on the cleanup and shutdown of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s.[6] In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste.[21] By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project.[60][61] After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries.[62] In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations[61] and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.[63]
Fluor built the Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in 2001 for $1.4 billion.[6] In 2004, the company was awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic infrastructure of Iraq after the Iraq War.[9][21] Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.[5] In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[64] In December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract to build a new Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.[65] Fluor recently took over as the primary contractor at Plant Vogtle, Units 3 & 4, and V.C. Summer, Units 2 & 3. CB&I previously had the contract.

Fluor Corporation is a multinational engineering and construction firm headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries in the following areas: oil and gas, industrial and infrastructure, government and power. It is the largest engineering & construction company in the Fortune 500 rankings and lists 149th overall in the same rankings.
Fluor was founded in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, predominantly by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for the oil and gas industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil and gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.
In the 1990s, Fluor introduced new services like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects and other environmental work became a significant portion of Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]




Headquarters of Fluor Bros Construction in the early 1900s


Fluor Corporation's predecessor, Rudolph Fluor & Brother, was founded in 1890 by John Simon Fluor[2] and his two brothers in Oshkosh, Wisconsin[3] as a saw and paper mill.[2] John Fluor acted as its president[2] and contributed $100 in personal savings to help the business get started.[4] The company was renamed Fluor Bros. Construction Co. in 1903.[2]
In 1912 John Fluor moved to Santa Ana, California for health reasons without his brothers[5] and founded Fluor Corporation out of his garage[6] under the name Fluor Construction Company.[5][7] By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars)[2] and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor.[8] A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated.[2] John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929.[8] In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation.[2] By the 1930s, Fluor had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.[4][9] Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war Fluor manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for a substantial portion of high-octane gasoline production in the United States.[4] A Gas-Gasoline division of Fluor was created in Houston in 1948.[2]
Fluor's headquarters were moved to Los Angeles in 1940 in order to be closer to its oil and gas clients, before moving again to Orange County, California in the 1960s due to concerns about the cost of living and traffic.[6] John Simon Fluor died in 1944. He was succeeded by his son Peter Fluor, who died three years later. Peter was followed by Shirley Meserve (1947) and Donald Darnell (1949), then John Simon "Si" Fluor Jr. in 1952 and J. Robert (Bob) Fluor in 1962.[2][10] Fluor was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1950s.[11] In 1961 Fluor acquired an interest in construction, design and contracting firm William J. Moran.[12]
Diversification and restructuring[edit]
Fluor diversified its business more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling and it started a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968[2] and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s.[11] Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America[2] and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction.[10][13] In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it.[6] The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.[2]
In 1977, Fluor acquired Daniel International Corporation.[14] Fluor's business had become predominantly international, while Daniel International's $1 billion construction business was mostly domestic. The acquisition allowed the company to use union labor at Fluor, or non-union labor at Daniel, for each client.[11] Fluor made a $2.9 billion acquisition of a zinc, gold, lead and coal mining operation, St. Joe Minerals, in 1981[15] after a bidding competition for the business with Seagram.[16][17]
By the 1980s, Fluor's primary business was building large refineries, petrochemical plants, oil pipelines and other facilities for the gas and oil industry,[18] especially in the Middle East.[18][19] By 1981, Fluor's staff had grown to 29,000 and revenue, backlog, and profits had each increased more than 30 percent over the prior year.[20] However, by 1984 the mining operation was causing heavy losses[21] and the oil and gas industry Fluor served was in a worldwide recession[22] due to declining oil prices.[18][23] From 1981 to 1984, Fluor's backlog went from $16 billion to $4 billion.[18] In 1985 it reported $633 million in losses.[24] David Tappan took Bob Fluor's place as CEO in 1984 after Bob died from cancer[18][25][26] and led a difficult restructuring.[27]
The company sold $750 million in assets, including Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, in order to pay $1 billion in debt.[26][27] Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000.[18] In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations.[2][28] Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel.[2] By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits[29] and $108.5 million by 1989.[26] By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries.[2] Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States.[18][22] Fluor's international revenues rebounded.[30] Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped down at the end of 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.[22][31]
Recent history[edit]
During the restructuring, Fluor's core construction and engineering work was diversified into 30 industries including food, paper manufacturers, prisons and others to reduce its vulnerability to market changes in the oil and gas market.[18][22] In the 1990s, the company tried to change its image, calling itself a "diversified technical services" firm.[18][32] It started offering equipment rentals, staffing services, and financing for construction projects.[18][32] The company began offering environmental cleanup and pollution control services, which grew to half of its new business by 1992.[21] Fluor's mining business grew from $300 million in 1990 to $1 billion in 1994.[33] The US government passed environmental regulations in 1995 that led to growth for the Massey Coal Co. business, because it had large reserves of low-sulfur coal.[34] In 1992, Fluor sold its ownership of Doe Run Company, the world's largest producer of refined lead, which was losing money at the time due to declining lead prices.[35] By 1993, Fluor had revenues of $4.17 billion and 22,000 staff.[2]
In 1997, Fluor's revenues fell almost 50 percent, in part due to the Asian financial crisis[36] and a decrease in overseas business.[30][37] Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project[38] in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project.[39] Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing.[2] In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called Fluor Signature Services.[36][40]
In January 1998 McCraw (age 63) resigned after being diagnosed with bladder cancer[41][42] and was replaced by former Shell President, Philip J. Carroll.[43] That same year, IT Group purchased a 54 percent interest in Fluor Daniel GTI, Fluor's environmental division, for $36.3 million.[2] Two years later, the coal mining operation under the A.T. Massey Coal Co. name (part of St. Joe) was spun off into its own business.[36] In 2001, Fluor's four primary subsidiaries were consolidated into a single Fluor Corporation.[10] In 2002 Alan Boeckmann was appointed as the CEO, followed by David Seaton in 2011.[10] In 2005, Fluor's headquarters were moved to the Las Colinas area in Irving, Texas.[9]
In December 2015 Fluor announced that it would take over Dutch industrial services company Stork.[44] The acquisition of this company, which modifies and maintains large power plants, was completed in March 2016, in a stock purchase worth $755 million.[45]
Organization[edit]
Fluor is the largest construction and engineering company in the Fortune 500[46] and the 149th largest company in the ranking overall.[47] It has offices in 25 countries. Many of Fluor's operations are located near natural resources, such as uranium in Canada, oil reserves in the Middle East and mines in Australia. About 30 percent of Fluor's revenues are based in the United States as of 2011.[48] The Fluor family owns a 3.5 percent interest in the company, while employees own six percent through its profit-sharing program.[11]
Fluor's Board of Directors has 12 "Independent Directors" and the CEO. The Independent Directors elect a Lead Independent Director every three years that acts as a liaison to the CEO.[49] Each Independent Director is on two or more of four committees: audit, executive, governance, and organization & compensation.[50] Directors serve a three-year term and are elected by shareholders.[49] Corporate officers, such as the CEO, are elected each year by a vote of the board.[51]
Fluor received an "A" ranking in Transparency International's 2012 anti-corruption study.[52] The company hosts online and in-person anti-corruption training sessions for staff and operates an ethics hotline. Former CEO Alan Boeckmann helped create the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI), whereby companies agree to a set of ethics principles.[53] A MarketLine SWOT analysis said Fluor's environmental work "enhances the company's brand image," while often lengthy and unpredictable legal disputes "tarnish the company's brand image and will erode customer confidence."[48]
According to the Los Angeles Times, Fluor is a "major corporate citizen" that supports local charities and civic groups.[43] It started the Fluor Foundation for its charitable work in 1952 and Fluor Cares in 2010.[10] The company started the largest employer-sponsored apprenticeship program in California with a four-year program for designers in 1982.[54] Fluor operates a virtual college for employees called Fluor University.[55]
Services[edit]




A Fluor construction site in Shuaiba, Kuwait


Fluor is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries.[48] Its subsidiaries provide engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management services. The company has also developed pollution control products, such as the Econamine lineup of carbon capture products.[48] According to Fluor's 2014 annual report, 67 percent of its work backlog is from the oil and gas industry.[56] According to the company's website, Fluor's work includes designing and building power plants, petrochemical factories, mining facilities, roads and bridges, government buildings, and manufacturing facilities. The company also performs nuclear cleanup and other services.[57]
Separate teams of experts, procurement staff, project managers and workers are provided for large projects that are supported by a centralized administrative staff. Fluor has trained more than 100,000 craft workers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, Pakistan, Kuwait and other countries, where the needed labor skills weren't available locally.[11] It may also serve clients through a joint venture with another construction firm when a local infrastructure or niche expertise is needed.[48]
Fluor acquired shares of Genetech Inc. in 1981[58] and it bought a 10 percent interest in a smelter and refinery facility in Gresik, Indonesia in 1995 for $550 million. In 1994, it invested $650 million with the Beacon Group Energy Investment fund to finance energy projects.[34] Fluor also has a majority interest in NuScale LLC., which is developing a new type of 45-megawatt nuclear reactor called a small modular reactor (SMR).[59]
Notable projects[edit]




A Fluor "Buddha Tower" water cooling tower from the early 1900s


Fluor's first projects were in constructing and grading roads, but by the 1920s it was known for building public facilities, industrial complexes[7] and serving a growing California oil and gas industry.[4][6] It started building office and meter manufacturing facilities for the Southern California Gas Company in 1915, as well as a compressor station for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company in 1919.[8] Fluor built the first "Buddha Tower" in 1921[7][8] in Signal Hill, California, for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company.[10] The Buddha Tower was a design of water-cooling tower named after the Buddha temples they resemble.[7][8] The following year Fluor was awarded a contract by Richfield Oil to build a 10,000-gallon-per-day gasoline plant.[11]
Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor expanded Fluor's business outside of California in the 1930s.[8] It built refineries in Texas,[11] as well as oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company.[8][10] Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world.[33] In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project.[7][9] It built an expansion of the Dhahran Aire Force Base in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s[7] and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.[11]
In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor built the first all-hydrogen refinery in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company.[7] It also constructed pumps and ports[11] for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,[7] which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska,[10] and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas on the island of Java in Indonesia.[2] In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.[11] In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served more than half of the world's government-owned oil companies.[11]




Fluor workers at a radiation cleanup site in Ohio


Fluor has been working on the cleanup and shutdown of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s.[6] In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste.[21] By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project.[60][61] After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries.[62] In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations[61] and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.[63]
Fluor built the Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in 2001 for $1.4 billion.[6] In 2004, the company was awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic infrastructure of Iraq after the Iraq War.[9][21] Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.[5] In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[64] In December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract to build a new Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.[65] Fluor recently took over as the primary contractor at Plant Vogtle, Units 3 & 4, and V.C. Summer, Units 2 & 3. CB&I previously had the contract.

Fluor Corporation is a multinational engineering and construction firm headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries in the following areas: oil and gas, industrial and infrastructure, government and power. It is the largest engineering & construction company in the Fortune 500 rankings and lists 149th overall in the same rankings.
Fluor was founded in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, predominantly by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for the oil and gas industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil and gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.
In the 1990s, Fluor introduced new services like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects and other environmental work became a significant portion of Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]




Headquarters of Fluor Bros Construction in the early 1900s


Fluor Corporation's predecessor, Rudolph Fluor & Brother, was founded in 1890 by John Simon Fluor[2] and his two brothers in Oshkosh, Wisconsin[3] as a saw and paper mill.[2] John Fluor acted as its president[2] and contributed $100 in personal savings to help the business get started.[4] The company was renamed Fluor Bros. Construction Co. in 1903.[2]
In 1912 John Fluor moved to Santa Ana, California for health reasons without his brothers[5] and founded Fluor Corporation out of his garage[6] under the name Fluor Construction Company.[5][7] By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars)[2] and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor.[8] A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated.[2] John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929.[8] In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation.[2] By the 1930s, Fluor had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.[4][9] Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war Fluor manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for a substantial portion of high-octane gasoline production in the United States.[4] A Gas-Gasoline division of Fluor was created in Houston in 1948.[2]
Fluor's headquarters were moved to Los Angeles in 1940 in order to be closer to its oil and gas clients, before moving again to Orange County, California in the 1960s due to concerns about the cost of living and traffic.[6] John Simon Fluor died in 1944. He was succeeded by his son Peter Fluor, who died three years later. Peter was followed by Shirley Meserve (1947) and Donald Darnell (1949), then John Simon "Si" Fluor Jr. in 1952 and J. Robert (Bob) Fluor in 1962.[2][10] Fluor was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1950s.[11] In 1961 Fluor acquired an interest in construction, design and contracting firm William J. Moran.[12]
Diversification and restructuring[edit]
Fluor diversified its business more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling and it started a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968[2] and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s.[11] Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America[2] and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction.[10][13] In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it.[6] The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.[2]
In 1977, Fluor acquired Daniel International Corporation.[14] Fluor's business had become predominantly international, while Daniel International's $1 billion construction business was mostly domestic. The acquisition allowed the company to use union labor at Fluor, or non-union labor at Daniel, for each client.[11] Fluor made a $2.9 billion acquisition of a zinc, gold, lead and coal mining operation, St. Joe Minerals, in 1981[15] after a bidding competition for the business with Seagram.[16][17]
By the 1980s, Fluor's primary business was building large refineries, petrochemical plants, oil pipelines and other facilities for the gas and oil industry,[18] especially in the Middle East.[18][19] By 1981, Fluor's staff had grown to 29,000 and revenue, backlog, and profits had each increased more than 30 percent over the prior year.[20] However, by 1984 the mining operation was causing heavy losses[21] and the oil and gas industry Fluor served was in a worldwide recession[22] due to declining oil prices.[18][23] From 1981 to 1984, Fluor's backlog went from $16 billion to $4 billion.[18] In 1985 it reported $633 million in losses.[24] David Tappan took Bob Fluor's place as CEO in 1984 after Bob died from cancer[18][25][26] and led a difficult restructuring.[27]
The company sold $750 million in assets, including Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, in order to pay $1 billion in debt.[26][27] Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000.[18] In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations.[2][28] Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel.[2] By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits[29] and $108.5 million by 1989.[26] By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries.[2] Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States.[18][22] Fluor's international revenues rebounded.[30] Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped down at the end of 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.[22][31]
Recent history[edit]
During the restructuring, Fluor's core construction and engineering work was diversified into 30 industries including food, paper manufacturers, prisons and others to reduce its vulnerability to market changes in the oil and gas market.[18][22] In the 1990s, the company tried to change its image, calling itself a "diversified technical services" firm.[18][32] It started offering equipment rentals, staffing services, and financing for construction projects.[18][32] The company began offering environmental cleanup and pollution control services, which grew to half of its new business by 1992.[21] Fluor's mining business grew from $300 million in 1990 to $1 billion in 1994.[33] The US government passed environmental regulations in 1995 that led to growth for the Massey Coal Co. business, because it had large reserves of low-sulfur coal.[34] In 1992, Fluor sold its ownership of Doe Run Company, the world's largest producer of refined lead, which was losing money at the time due to declining lead prices.[35] By 1993, Fluor had revenues of $4.17 billion and 22,000 staff.[2]
In 1997, Fluor's revenues fell almost 50 percent, in part due to the Asian financial crisis[36] and a decrease in overseas business.[30][37] Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project[38] in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project.[39] Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing.[2] In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called Fluor Signature Services.[36][40]
In January 1998 McCraw (age 63) resigned after being diagnosed with bladder cancer[41][42] and was replaced by former Shell President, Philip J. Carroll.[43] That same year, IT Group purchased a 54 percent interest in Fluor Daniel GTI, Fluor's environmental division, for $36.3 million.[2] Two years later, the coal mining operation under the A.T. Massey Coal Co. name (part of St. Joe) was spun off into its own business.[36] In 2001, Fluor's four primary subsidiaries were consolidated into a single Fluor Corporation.[10] In 2002 Alan Boeckmann was appointed as the CEO, followed by David Seaton in 2011.[10] In 2005, Fluor's headquarters were moved to the Las Colinas area in Irving, Texas.[9]
In December 2015 Fluor announced that it would take over Dutch industrial services company Stork.[44] The acquisition of this company, which modifies and maintains large power plants, was completed in March 2016, in a stock purchase worth $755 million.[45]
Organization[edit]
Fluor is the largest construction and engineering company in the Fortune 500[46] and the 149th largest company in the ranking overall.[47] It has offices in 25 countries. Many of Fluor's operations are located near natural resources, such as uranium in Canada, oil reserves in the Middle East and mines in Australia. About 30 percent of Fluor's revenues are based in the United States as of 2011.[48] The Fluor family owns a 3.5 percent interest in the company, while employees own six percent through its profit-sharing program.[11]
Fluor's Board of Directors has 12 "Independent Directors" and the CEO. The Independent Directors elect a Lead Independent Director every three years that acts as a liaison to the CEO.[49] Each Independent Director is on two or more of four committees: audit, executive, governance, and organization & compensation.[50] Directors serve a three-year term and are elected by shareholders.[49] Corporate officers, such as the CEO, are elected each year by a vote of the board.[51]
Fluor received an "A" ranking in Transparency International's 2012 anti-corruption study.[52] The company hosts online and in-person anti-corruption training sessions for staff and operates an ethics hotline. Former CEO Alan Boeckmann helped create the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI), whereby companies agree to a set of ethics principles.[53] A MarketLine SWOT analysis said Fluor's environmental work "enhances the company's brand image," while often lengthy and unpredictable legal disputes "tarnish the company's brand image and will erode customer confidence."[48]
According to the Los Angeles Times, Fluor is a "major corporate citizen" that supports local charities and civic groups.[43] It started the Fluor Foundation for its charitable work in 1952 and Fluor Cares in 2010.[10] The company started the largest employer-sponsored apprenticeship program in California with a four-year program for designers in 1982.[54] Fluor operates a virtual college for employees called Fluor University.[55]
Services[edit]




A Fluor construction site in Shuaiba, Kuwait


Fluor is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries.[48] Its subsidiaries provide engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management services. The company has also developed pollution control products, such as the Econamine lineup of carbon capture products.[48] According to Fluor's 2014 annual report, 67 percent of its work backlog is from the oil and gas industry.[56] According to the company's website, Fluor's work includes designing and building power plants, petrochemical factories, mining facilities, roads and bridges, government buildings, and manufacturing facilities. The company also performs nuclear cleanup and other services.[57]
Separate teams of experts, procurement staff, project managers and workers are provided for large projects that are supported by a centralized administrative staff. Fluor has trained more than 100,000 craft workers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, Pakistan, Kuwait and other countries, where the needed labor skills weren't available locally.[11] It may also serve clients through a joint venture with another construction firm when a local infrastructure or niche expertise is needed.[48]
Fluor acquired shares of Genetech Inc. in 1981[58] and it bought a 10 percent interest in a smelter and refinery facility in Gresik, Indonesia in 1995 for $550 million. In 1994, it invested $650 million with the Beacon Group Energy Investment fund to finance energy projects.[34] Fluor also has a majority interest in NuScale LLC., which is developing a new type of 45-megawatt nuclear reactor called a small modular reactor (SMR).[59]
Notable projects[edit]




A Fluor "Buddha Tower" water cooling tower from the early 1900s


Fluor's first projects were in constructing and grading roads, but by the 1920s it was known for building public facilities, industrial complexes[7] and serving a growing California oil and gas industry.[4][6] It started building office and meter manufacturing facilities for the Southern California Gas Company in 1915, as well as a compressor station for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company in 1919.[8] Fluor built the first "Buddha Tower" in 1921[7][8] in Signal Hill, California, for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company.[10] The Buddha Tower was a design of water-cooling tower named after the Buddha temples they resemble.[7][8] The following year Fluor was awarded a contract by Richfield Oil to build a 10,000-gallon-per-day gasoline plant.[11]
Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor expanded Fluor's business outside of California in the 1930s.[8] It built refineries in Texas,[11] as well as oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company.[8][10] Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world.[33] In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project.[7][9] It built an expansion of the Dhahran Aire Force Base in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s[7] and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.[11]
In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor built the first all-hydrogen refinery in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company.[7] It also constructed pumps and ports[11] for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,[7] which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska,[10] and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas on the island of Java in Indonesia.[2] In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.[11] In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served more than half of the world's government-owned oil companies.[11]




Fluor workers at a radiation cleanup site in Ohio


Fluor has been working on the cleanup and shutdown of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s.[6] In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste.[21] By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project.[60][61] After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries.[62] In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations[61] and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.[63]
Fluor built the Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in 2001 for $1.4 billion.[6] In 2004, the company was awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic infrastructure of Iraq after the Iraq War.[9][21] Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.[5] In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[64] In December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract to build a new Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.[65] Fluor recently took over as the primary contractor at Plant Vogtle, Units 3 & 4, and V.C. Summer, Units 2 & 3. CB&I previously had the contract.

Fluor Corporation is a multinational engineering and construction firm headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries in the following areas: oil and gas, industrial and infrastructure, government and power. It is the largest engineering & construction company in the Fortune 500 rankings and lists 149th overall in the same rankings.
Fluor was founded in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, predominantly by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for the oil and gas industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil and gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.
In the 1990s, Fluor introduced new services like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects and other environmental work became a significant portion of Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]




Headquarters of Fluor Bros Construction in the early 1900s


Fluor Corporation's predecessor, Rudolph Fluor & Brother, was founded in 1890 by John Simon Fluor[2] and his two brothers in Oshkosh, Wisconsin[3] as a saw and paper mill.[2] John Fluor acted as its president[2] and contributed $100 in personal savings to help the business get started.[4] The company was renamed Fluor Bros. Construction Co. in 1903.[2]
In 1912 John Fluor moved to Santa Ana, California for health reasons without his brothers[5] and founded Fluor Corporation out of his garage[6] under the name Fluor Construction Company.[5][7] By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars)[2] and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor.[8] A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated.[2] John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929.[8] In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation.[2] By the 1930s, Fluor had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.[4][9] Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war Fluor manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for a substantial portion of high-octane gasoline production in the United States.[4] A Gas-Gasoline division of Fluor was created in Houston in 1948.[2]
Fluor's headquarters were moved to Los Angeles in 1940 in order to be closer to its oil and gas clients, before moving again to Orange County, California in the 1960s due to concerns about the cost of living and traffic.[6] John Simon Fluor died in 1944. He was succeeded by his son Peter Fluor, who died three years later. Peter was followed by Shirley Meserve (1947) and Donald Darnell (1949), then John Simon "Si" Fluor Jr. in 1952 and J. Robert (Bob) Fluor in 1962.[2][10] Fluor was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1950s.[11] In 1961 Fluor acquired an interest in construction, design and contracting firm William J. Moran.[12]
Diversification and restructuring[edit]
Fluor diversified its business more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling and it started a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968[2] and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s.[11] Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America[2] and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction.[10][13] In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it.[6] The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.[2]
In 1977, Fluor acquired Daniel International Corporation.[14] Fluor's business had become predominantly international, while Daniel International's $1 billion construction business was mostly domestic. The acquisition allowed the company to use union labor at Fluor, or non-union labor at Daniel, for each client.[11] Fluor made a $2.9 billion acquisition of a zinc, gold, lead and coal mining operation, St. Joe Minerals, in 1981[15] after a bidding competition for the business with Seagram.[16][17]
By the 1980s, Fluor's primary business was building large refineries, petrochemical plants, oil pipelines and other facilities for the gas and oil industry,[18] especially in the Middle East.[18][19] By 1981, Fluor's staff had grown to 29,000 and revenue, backlog, and profits had each increased more than 30 percent over the prior year.[20] However, by 1984 the mining operation was causing heavy losses[21] and the oil and gas industry Fluor served was in a worldwide recession[22] due to declining oil prices.[18][23] From 1981 to 1984, Fluor's backlog went from $16 billion to $4 billion.[18] In 1985 it reported $633 million in losses.[24] David Tappan took Bob Fluor's place as CEO in 1984 after Bob died from cancer[18][25][26] and led a difficult restructuring.[27]
The company sold $750 million in assets, including Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, in order to pay $1 billion in debt.[26][27] Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000.[18] In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations.[2][28] Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel.[2] By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits[29] and $108.5 million by 1989.[26] By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries.[2] Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States.[18][22] Fluor's international revenues rebounded.[30] Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped down at the end of 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.[22][31]
Recent history[edit]
During the restructuring, Fluor's core construction and engineering work was diversified into 30 industries including food, paper manufacturers, prisons and others to reduce its vulnerability to market changes in the oil and gas market.[18][22] In the 1990s, the company tried to change its image, calling itself a "diversified technical services" firm.[18][32] It started offering equipment rentals, staffing services, and financing for construction projects.[18][32] The company began offering environmental cleanup and pollution control services, which grew to half of its new business by 1992.[21] Fluor's mining business grew from $300 million in 1990 to $1 billion in 1994.[33] The US government passed environmental regulations in 1995 that led to growth for the Massey Coal Co. business, because it had large reserves of low-sulfur coal.[34] In 1992, Fluor sold its ownership of Doe Run Company, the world's largest producer of refined lead, which was losing money at the time due to declining lead prices.[35] By 1993, Fluor had revenues of $4.17 billion and 22,000 staff.[2]
In 1997, Fluor's revenues fell almost 50 percent, in part due to the Asian financial crisis[36] and a decrease in overseas business.[30][37] Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project[38] in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project.[39] Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing.[2] In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called Fluor Signature Services.[36][40]
In January 1998 McCraw (age 63) resigned after being diagnosed with bladder cancer[41][42] and was replaced by former Shell President, Philip J. Carroll.[43] That same year, IT Group purchased a 54 percent interest in Fluor Daniel GTI, Fluor's environmental division, for $36.3 million.[2] Two years later, the coal mining operation under the A.T. Massey Coal Co. name (part of St. Joe) was spun off into its own business.[36] In 2001, Fluor's four primary subsidiaries were consolidated into a single Fluor Corporation.[10] In 2002 Alan Boeckmann was appointed as the CEO, followed by David Seaton in 2011.[10] In 2005, Fluor's headquarters were moved to the Las Colinas area in Irving, Texas.[9]
In December 2015 Fluor announced that it would take over Dutch industrial services company Stork.[44] The acquisition of this company, which modifies and maintains large power plants, was completed in March 2016, in a stock purchase worth $755 million.[45]
Organization[edit]
Fluor is the largest construction and engineering company in the Fortune 500[46] and the 149th largest company in the ranking overall.[47] It has offices in 25 countries. Many of Fluor's operations are located near natural resources, such as uranium in Canada, oil reserves in the Middle East and mines in Australia. About 30 percent of Fluor's revenues are based in the United States as of 2011.[48] The Fluor family owns a 3.5 percent interest in the company, while employees own six percent through its profit-sharing program.[11]
Fluor's Board of Directors has 12 "Independent Directors" and the CEO. The Independent Directors elect a Lead Independent Director every three years that acts as a liaison to the CEO.[49] Each Independent Director is on two or more of four committees: audit, executive, governance, and organization & compensation.[50] Directors serve a three-year term and are elected by shareholders.[49] Corporate officers, such as the CEO, are elected each year by a vote of the board.[51]
Fluor received an "A" ranking in Transparency International's 2012 anti-corruption study.[52] The company hosts online and in-person anti-corruption training sessions for staff and operates an ethics hotline. Former CEO Alan Boeckmann helped create the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI), whereby companies agree to a set of ethics principles.[53] A MarketLine SWOT analysis said Fluor's environmental work "enhances the company's brand image," while often lengthy and unpredictable legal disputes "tarnish the company's brand image and will erode customer confidence."[48]
According to the Los Angeles Times, Fluor is a "major corporate citizen" that supports local charities and civic groups.[43] It started the Fluor Foundation for its charitable work in 1952 and Fluor Cares in 2010.[10] The company started the largest employer-sponsored apprenticeship program in California with a four-year program for designers in 1982.[54] Fluor operates a virtual college for employees called Fluor University.[55]
Services[edit]




A Fluor construction site in Shuaiba, Kuwait


Fluor is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries.[48] Its subsidiaries provide engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management services. The company has also developed pollution control products, such as the Econamine lineup of carbon capture products.[48] According to Fluor's 2014 annual report, 67 percent of its work backlog is from the oil and gas industry.[56] According to the company's website, Fluor's work includes designing and building power plants, petrochemical factories, mining facilities, roads and bridges, government buildings, and manufacturing facilities. The company also performs nuclear cleanup and other services.[57]
Separate teams of experts, procurement staff, project managers and workers are provided for large projects that are supported by a centralized administrative staff. Fluor has trained more than 100,000 craft workers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, Pakistan, Kuwait and other countries, where the needed labor skills weren't available locally.[11] It may also serve clients through a joint venture with another construction firm when a local infrastructure or niche expertise is needed.[48]
Fluor acquired shares of Genetech Inc. in 1981[58] and it bought a 10 percent interest in a smelter and refinery facility in Gresik, Indonesia in 1995 for $550 million. In 1994, it invested $650 million with the Beacon Group Energy Investment fund to finance energy projects.[34] Fluor also has a majority interest in NuScale LLC., which is developing a new type of 45-megawatt nuclear reactor called a small modular reactor (SMR).[59]
Notable projects[edit]




A Fluor "Buddha Tower" water cooling tower from the early 1900s


Fluor's first projects were in constructing and grading roads, but by the 1920s it was known for building public facilities, industrial complexes[7] and serving a growing California oil and gas industry.[4][6] It started building office and meter manufacturing facilities for the Southern California Gas Company in 1915, as well as a compressor station for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company in 1919.[8] Fluor built the first "Buddha Tower" in 1921[7][8] in Signal Hill, California, for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company.[10] The Buddha Tower was a design of water-cooling tower named after the Buddha temples they resemble.[7][8] The following year Fluor was awarded a contract by Richfield Oil to build a 10,000-gallon-per-day gasoline plant.[11]
Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor expanded Fluor's business outside of California in the 1930s.[8] It built refineries in Texas,[11] as well as oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company.[8][10] Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world.[33] In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project.[7][9] It built an expansion of the Dhahran Aire Force Base in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s[7] and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.[11]
In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor built the first all-hydrogen refinery in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company.[7] It also constructed pumps and ports[11] for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,[7] which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska,[10] and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas on the island of Java in Indonesia.[2] In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.[11] In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served more than half of the world's government-owned oil companies.[11]




Fluor workers at a radiation cleanup site in Ohio


Fluor has been working on the cleanup and shutdown of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s.[6] In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste.[21] By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project.[60][61] After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries.[62] In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations[61] and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.[63]
Fluor built the Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in 2001 for $1.4 billion.[6] In 2004, the company was awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic infrastructure of Iraq after the Iraq War.[9][21] Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.[5] In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[64] In December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract to build a new Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.[65] Fluor recently took over as the primary contractor at Plant Vogtle, Units 3 & 4, and V.C. Summer, Units 2 & 3. CB&I previously had the contract.

Fluor Corporation is a multinational engineering and construction firm headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries in the following areas: oil and gas, industrial and infrastructure, government and power. It is the largest engineering & construction company in the Fortune 500 rankings and lists 149th overall in the same rankings.
Fluor was founded in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, predominantly by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for the oil and gas industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil and gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.
In the 1990s, Fluor introduced new services like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects and other environmental work became a significant portion of Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]




Headquarters of Fluor Bros Construction in the early 1900s


Fluor Corporation's predecessor, Rudolph Fluor & Brother, was founded in 1890 by John Simon Fluor[2] and his two brothers in Oshkosh, Wisconsin[3] as a saw and paper mill.[2] John Fluor acted as its president[2] and contributed $100 in personal savings to help the business get started.[4] The company was renamed Fluor Bros. Construction Co. in 1903.[2]
In 1912 John Fluor moved to Santa Ana, California for health reasons without his brothers[5] and founded Fluor Corporation out of his garage[6] under the name Fluor Construction Company.[5][7] By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars)[2] and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor.[8] A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated.[2] John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929.[8] In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation.[2] By the 1930s, Fluor had operations in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.[4][9] Business declined rapidly during the Great Depression, but picked up again during World War II. During the war Fluor manufactured synthetic rubber and was responsible for a substantial portion of high-octane gasoline production in the United States.[4] A Gas-Gasoline division of Fluor was created in Houston in 1948.[2]
Fluor's headquarters were moved to Los Angeles in 1940 in order to be closer to its oil and gas clients, before moving again to Orange County, California in the 1960s due to concerns about the cost of living and traffic.[6] John Simon Fluor died in 1944. He was succeeded by his son Peter Fluor, who died three years later. Peter was followed by Shirley Meserve (1947) and Donald Darnell (1949), then John Simon "Si" Fluor Jr. in 1952 and J. Robert (Bob) Fluor in 1962.[2][10] Fluor was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1950s.[11] In 1961 Fluor acquired an interest in construction, design and contracting firm William J. Moran.[12]
Diversification and restructuring[edit]
Fluor diversified its business more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling and it started a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968[2] and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s.[11] Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America[2] and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction.[10][13] In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it.[6] The following year, the company's oil and gas operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil and Gas Corp.[2]
In 1977, Fluor acquired Daniel International Corporation.[14] Fluor's business had become predominantly international, while Daniel International's $1 billion construction business was mostly domestic. The acquisition allowed the company to use union labor at Fluor, or non-union labor at Daniel, for each client.[11] Fluor made a $2.9 billion acquisition of a zinc, gold, lead and coal mining operation, St. Joe Minerals, in 1981[15] after a bidding competition for the business with Seagram.[16][17]
By the 1980s, Fluor's primary business was building large refineries, petrochemical plants, oil pipelines and other facilities for the gas and oil industry,[18] especially in the Middle East.[18][19] By 1981, Fluor's staff had grown to 29,000 and revenue, backlog, and profits had each increased more than 30 percent over the prior year.[20] However, by 1984 the mining operation was causing heavy losses[21] and the oil and gas industry Fluor served was in a worldwide recession[22] due to declining oil prices.[18][23] From 1981 to 1984, Fluor's backlog went from $16 billion to $4 billion.[18] In 1985 it reported $633 million in losses.[24] David Tappan took Bob Fluor's place as CEO in 1984 after Bob died from cancer[18][25][26] and led a difficult restructuring.[27]
The company sold $750 million in assets, including Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, in order to pay $1 billion in debt.[26][27] Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000.[18] In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations.[2][28] Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel.[2] By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits[29] and $108.5 million by 1989.[26] By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries.[2] Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States.[18][22] Fluor's international revenues rebounded.[30] Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped down at the end of 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.[22][31]
Recent history[edit]
During the restructuring, Fluor's core construction and engineering work was diversified into 30 industries including food, paper manufacturers, prisons and others to reduce its vulnerability to market changes in the oil and gas market.[18][22] In the 1990s, the company tried to change its image, calling itself a "diversified technical services" firm.[18][32] It started offering equipment rentals, staffing services, and financing for construction projects.[18][32] The company began offering environmental cleanup and pollution control services, which grew to half of its new business by 1992.[21] Fluor's mining business grew from $300 million in 1990 to $1 billion in 1994.[33] The US government passed environmental regulations in 1995 that led to growth for the Massey Coal Co. business, because it had large reserves of low-sulfur coal.[34] In 1992, Fluor sold its ownership of Doe Run Company, the world's largest producer of refined lead, which was losing money at the time due to declining lead prices.[35] By 1993, Fluor had revenues of $4.17 billion and 22,000 staff.[2]
In 1997, Fluor's revenues fell almost 50 percent, in part due to the Asian financial crisis[36] and a decrease in overseas business.[30][37] Additionally, it suffered losses from an over-budget power plant project[38] in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia. Fluor was a sub-contractor to General Electric for the project. Fluor's subsidiaries sued GE alleging that it misrepresented the complexity of the project.[39] Though revenues declined further the following year, profits were increasing.[2] In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed. Fluor Daniel was re-structured into four business groups: an engineering and construction firm called Fluor Daniel; an equipment rental, staffing and telecommunications division called Fluor Global Services; a coal-mining business called A.T. Massey Coal Co. and an administrative and support division called Fluor Signature Services.[36][40]
In January 1998 McCraw (age 63) resigned after being diagnosed with bladder cancer[41][42] and was replaced by former Shell President, Philip J. Carroll.[43] That same year, IT Group purchased a 54 percent interest in Fluor Daniel GTI, Fluor's environmental division, for $36.3 million.[2] Two years later, the coal mining operation under the A.T. Massey Coal Co. name (part of St. Joe) was spun off into its own business.[36] In 2001, Fluor's four primary subsidiaries were consolidated into a single Fluor Corporation.[10] In 2002 Alan Boeckmann was appointed as the CEO, followed by David Seaton in 2011.[10] In 2005, Fluor's headquarters were moved to the Las Colinas area in Irving, Texas.[9]
In December 2015 Fluor announced that it would take over Dutch industrial services company Stork.[44] The acquisition of this company, which modifies and maintains large power plants, was completed in March 2016, in a stock purchase worth $755 million.[45]
Organization[edit]
Fluor is the largest construction and engineering company in the Fortune 500[46] and the 149th largest company in the ranking overall.[47] It has offices in 25 countries. Many of Fluor's operations are located near natural resources, such as uranium in Canada, oil reserves in the Middle East and mines in Australia. About 30 percent of Fluor's revenues are based in the United States as of 2011.[48] The Fluor family owns a 3.5 percent interest in the company, while employees own six percent through its profit-sharing program.[11]
Fluor's Board of Directors has 12 "Independent Directors" and the CEO. The Independent Directors elect a Lead Independent Director every three years that acts as a liaison to the CEO.[49] Each Independent Director is on two or more of four committees: audit, executive, governance, and organization & compensation.[50] Directors serve a three-year term and are elected by shareholders.[49] Corporate officers, such as the CEO, are elected each year by a vote of the board.[51]
Fluor received an "A" ranking in Transparency International's 2012 anti-corruption study.[52] The company hosts online and in-person anti-corruption training sessions for staff and operates an ethics hotline. Former CEO Alan Boeckmann helped create the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI), whereby companies agree to a set of ethics principles.[53] A MarketLine SWOT analysis said Fluor's environmental work "enhances the company's brand image," while often lengthy and unpredictable legal disputes "tarnish the company's brand image and will erode customer confidence."[48]
According to the Los Angeles Times, Fluor is a "major corporate citizen" that supports local charities and civic groups.[43] It started the Fluor Foundation for its charitable work in 1952 and Fluor Cares in 2010.[10] The company started the largest employer-sponsored apprenticeship program in California with a four-year program for designers in 1982.[54] Fluor operates a virtual college for employees called Fluor University.[55]
Services[edit]




A Fluor construction site in Shuaiba, Kuwait


Fluor is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries.[48] Its subsidiaries provide engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management services. The company has also developed pollution control products, such as the Econamine lineup of carbon capture products.[48] According to Fluor's 2014 annual report, 67 percent of its work backlog is from the oil and gas industry.[56] According to the company's website, Fluor's work includes designing and building power plants, petrochemical factories, mining facilities, roads and bridges, government buildings, and manufacturing facilities. The company also performs nuclear cleanup and other services.[57]
Separate teams of experts, procurement staff, project managers and workers are provided for large projects that are supported by a centralized administrative staff. Fluor has trained more than 100,000 craft workers in Indonesia, the Philippines, Korea, Pakistan, Kuwait and other countries, where the needed labor skills weren't available locally.[11] It may also serve clients through a joint venture with another construction firm when a local infrastructure or niche expertise is needed.[48]
Fluor acquired shares of Genetech Inc. in 1981[58] and it bought a 10 percent interest in a smelter and refinery facility in Gresik, Indonesia in 1995 for $550 million. In 1994, it invested $650 million with the Beacon Group Energy Investment fund to finance energy projects.[34] Fluor also has a majority interest in NuScale LLC., which is developing a new type of 45-megawatt nuclear reactor called a small modular reactor (SMR).[59]
Notable projects[edit]




A Fluor "Buddha Tower" water cooling tower from the early 1900s


Fluor's first projects were in constructing and grading roads, but by the 1920s it was known for building public facilities, industrial complexes[7] and serving a growing California oil and gas industry.[4][6] It started building office and meter manufacturing facilities for the Southern California Gas Company in 1915, as well as a compressor station for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company in 1919.[8] Fluor built the first "Buddha Tower" in 1921[7][8] in Signal Hill, California, for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company.[10] The Buddha Tower was a design of water-cooling tower named after the Buddha temples they resemble.[7][8] The following year Fluor was awarded a contract by Richfield Oil to build a 10,000-gallon-per-day gasoline plant.[11]
Against his father's wishes, Peter Fluor expanded Fluor's business outside of California in the 1930s.[8] It built refineries in Texas,[11] as well as oil pipelines and compressor stations from Panhandle, Texas, to Indianapolis, Indiana, for the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company.[8][10] Fluor constructed the Escondida in Chile, which is the second-largest copper mine in the world.[33] In 1942, Fluor constructed cooling towers and other facilities in Hanford, Washington, for the Manhattan Project.[7][9] It built an expansion of the Dhahran Aire Force Base in Saudi Arabia for the United States Army in the 1950s[7] and accepted its first international project for ARAMCO in the Middle East.[11]
In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor built the first all-hydrogen refinery in Kuwait and the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company.[7] It also constructed pumps and ports[11] for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,[7] which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska,[10] and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas on the island of Java in Indonesia.[2] In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices.[11] In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served more than half of the world's government-owned oil companies.[11]




Fluor workers at a radiation cleanup site in Ohio


Fluor has been working on the cleanup and shutdown of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s.[6] In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste.[21] By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated nuclear site in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project.[60][61] After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries.[62] In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations[61] and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.[63]
Fluor built the Aladdin Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in 2001 for $1.4 billion.[6] In 2004, the company was awarded a $1.1 billion project with AMEC to help rebuild the water, power and civic infrastructure of Iraq after the Iraq War.[9][21] Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.[5] In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[64] In December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract to build a new Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.[65] Fluor recently took over as the primary contractor at Plant Vogtle, Units 3 & 4, and V.C. Summer, Units 2 & 3. CB&I previously had the contract.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies 
FMR LLC is the parent company of various Fidelity Entities. Some of these Fidelity Entities are financial services companies, that may be registered under federal or state laws, and others are not regulated as such and may, for example, provide information and content publishing services. A listing of all Fidelity Entities, that provide content on the Fidelity Sites, is listed below.
Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.
The following investments and brokerage products and services are offered through Fidelity Sites by the Fidelity Entity indicated. These four Fidelity Entities are also broker-dealers:

These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.
 
 529 College Savings Plans 
The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security, or any other product or service, to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction.

Limited, Fidelity Investments Japan, and Fidelity Brokerage Services Japan LLC offer products and services designed specifically for overseas investors.
 
 Broker-dealer's potential conflicts 
As a broker-dealer, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC or its affiliates may act as principal for its own account or as agent for its customers in connection with the sale to you or purchase by you of a security that is the subject of content prepared by Fidelity. If it receives a mark-up or commission or acts as agent for another person in connection with any such transaction, Fidelity may have a potential conflict of interest. You understand this potential conflict and acknowledge that you may choose to effect securities transactions at another broker-dealer.
 
 Limitations on investment guidance and professional advice 
The Fidelity Sites are not intended to provide legal, tax, investment or insurance advice. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Fidelity or any third party. Certain investment planning tools available on the Fidelity Sites may provide general investment education based on your input. You are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
