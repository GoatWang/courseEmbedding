History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]

It's showtime for Encore - Jun. 3, 1998



















 





















News











	It's showtime for Encore 
	



June 3, 1998:  3:15 p.m. ET Liberty Media sees no need for original programming despite industry shift   





















NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Even as premium cable channel Showtime increases its dependence on original programming, competing network Encore/Starz! doesn't feel the pressure to follow suit.
    
Since October 1996, Viacom Inc.'s Showtime has turned to original programming in hopes of winning over television audiences and market share.    
The shift underscores the dominant role industry leader HBO has played in the premium cable segment. HBO, a unit of Time Warner Inc., has been utilizing original programming since 1981.    
But Encore/Starz!, whose parent company Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) lacks production ties with any major studio, isn't concerned about the void.    
"They [Showtime] haven't gone to original production by choice. They've gone because they don't have studio output," explained Robert Bennett, president and chief executive at Liberty Media, TCI's programming subsidiary.    
Indeed, Bennett highlighted one of the concerns that has led many on Wall Street to speculate about the future of Showtime in Viacom's portfolio of assets.     
"It's my view that Viacom is somehow trying to spin it off or sell it. With the competition from Encore/Starz! and the dominance of HBO, there just isn't that much room for it," said Arthur Rockwell, analyst at Drake Securities.    
Despite this year's strong positioning of Showtime, the Viacom network faces a sharp reduction in its theatrical products as a result of shifting supply agreements in the near future.    

    
By 1999, Showtime will gain the exclusive distribution rights of new releases from Paramount Studios. But the network loses the broadcast rights for Sony's TriStar and Time Warner's Castle Rock to HBO in the year 2000.    
That leaves Showtime with Polygram (pending the status of its merger into Universal Pictures) and MGM/UA, a major studio known for its high-quality, low-quantity release schedule.    
Meanwhile, Encore/Starz! will retain Seagram Co.'s Universal Pictures, Time Warner's New Line and the theatrical releases of Buena Vista/Miramax, units of Walt Disney Co.    
"We don't feel a need to create a lot of new product," Bennett said during a telephone interview with CNNfn.    
And with the lion's share of Hollywood product going toward HBO, industry observers have renewed speculation about a possible alliance between the perennial No. 2 and No. 3 premium cable channels.    
"Somewhere down the road, a closer alliance between Starz! and Showtime may make sense," said Philip Olsen, analyst at UBS Securities.    
But attempts in the early part of this decade for Showtime and Encore/Starz! to join forces were stopped by federal regulators. And Liberty Media's Bennett refuted any notion that the two companies were currently interested in such a partnership.    
Bennett, however, did confirm negotiations over a possible alliance with Cablevision Systems Corp. in an effort to strengthen its subscriber base, which totaled 19 million customers as of March 31.    
In February, Cablevision became 33 percent owned by Liberty Media's parent, TCI. That led many to speculate about partnerships between Encore/Starz! and American Movie Classics/Bravo, two Cablevision properties.    
"We're partners with them at various levels. We have held talks all the time but I don't want to comment,"  Bennett  said.    
In order to maintain its position in the face of competition from digital broadcast satellite (DBS), Encore/Starz! has relied on multiple channel broadcasting based on various themes such as action or romance.    
And this strategy, known as "thematic multiplexing," has been duplicated by Showtime as well as HBO.    
"If you're not thinking that way and stuck in an old [business] model, it could be bad for you," Bennett said.    
Showtime
    
In the meantime, Showtime, which boasts 18.6 million subscribers, plans to further concentrate on original programming in its battle against HBO.    
Last weekend's "Thanks of a Grateful Nation" -- a made-for-television film focusing on the debate over Gulf War Syndrome -- was watched by an estimated 966,240 American households.    
In the near term, Showtime benefits from one of the industry's busiest release schedules. The network, which normally runs about 70 theatrical releases annually, will have more than 100 Hollywood films in 1998.    
"In fact, Showtime suppliers will release more pictures than either HBO or Starz!" said Matthew Duda, executive vice president of program acquisitions at Showtime.    
Shares of Showtime's parent company, Viacom (VIA), were down 1/2 at 54-1/4 in Wednesday trading on the American Stock Exchange.    
Liberty Media's stock (LBTYA) was up 7/8 at 34-1/4 on the Nasdaq. Time Warner shares (TWX) lost 1-3/16 to 75-13/16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – 2015 Year in Review
Written by Stephen Dunne, February 2, 2016 ,  CFPB, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 


Tweet













By: Mike Licht
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – 2015 Year in Review
Consumers’ complained about 716 different debt collectors to the CFPB.  Approximately, 84,700 debt collection complaints were received  by the CFPB.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created by the Dodd-Frank Act as the nation’s first federal agency with a mission of focusing solely on consumer financial protection and making consumer financial markets work for American consumers, responsible businesses, and the economy as a whole. 
Listening to consumers
Listening and responding to consumers is central to the Bureau’s mission.  Consumer engagement strengthens the Bureau’s understanding of current issues in the ever-changing consumer financial marketplace.  The Bureau has continued to improve and expand the capabilities of its Office of Consumer Response (Consumer Response) to receive, process, and facilitate responses to consumer complaints. Consumer Response has also continued to develop and update a robust public Consumer Complaint Database. As of September 30, 2015 the database was populated by over 465,000 complaints from consumers about financial products and services from all over the country
Consumer Protection
The Bureau seeks to serve as a resource on the macro level, by writing clear rules of the road and enforcing consumer financial laws in ways that improve the consumer financial marketplace, and on the micro level, by helping individual consumers resolve their specific issues with financial products and services.
Consumer Concerns
As markets and consumers continue to emerge from the continuing effects of the devastating financial crisis of 2008, the Bureau finds that debt collection is central and cuts across virtually all credit products: credit cards, mortgages, student loans, payday loans, and other consumer loans. Around 35 percent of adults, or 77 million of the 220 million Americans with credit files, show debts in collections. These debts range from less than $25 to more than $125,000, averaging $5,178. Many consumers are not aware that they have debts in collections until they receive calls from debt collectors or review their credit reports.
Debt Collection Industry
Debt collection is a $13 billion dollar industry, employing more than 140,000 workers, in as many as 6,000 firms. Debt collectors generate most of their revenue from collections of medical debt, student loans, and financial services obligations such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Over half the industry’s revenue ($6.56 billion) is generated by collection agencies working on behalf of creditors and charging fees for services, often a percentage of the amount collected.  Nearly one third of the revenue ($4.22 billion) in the debt collection space comes from debt buyers, who purchase accounts from the original creditor or other debt buyers.

Consumers’ Debt Collection Complaints
Consumers’ complained about 716 different debt collectors to the CFPB.  Approximately, 84,700 debt collection complaints were received  by the CFPB.

Types of debt behind the complaints:

Cell phone / health club (29%)
Credit card (21%)
I do not know (20%)
Medical (16%)
Payday loan (5%)
Mortgage (3%)
Non-federal student loan (2%)
Auto (2%)
Federal student loan (1%)

Breakdown of complaints:

Continued attempts to collect debt not owed (Debt was discharged in bankruptcy, debt resulted from identity theft, debt was paid, debt is not mine)

Disclosure verification of debt (19%)

Communication tactics (17%)

Communication tactics (Frequent or repeated calls, called outside of 8am-9pm, used obscene, profane or other abusive language, threatened to take legal action, called after sent written cease of communication notice)

False statements or representation (8%)

False statements or representation (Attempted to collect wrong amount, impersonated attorney, law enforcement or government official, indicated committing crime by not paying debt, indicated should not respond to lawsuit)

Improper contact or sharing of info (7%)

Improper contact or sharing of information (Contacted me after I asked not to, contacted my employer, contacted me instead of my attorney, talked to a third party about my debt)

CFPB Enforcement Actions Against Debt Collectors
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. World Law Group (S.D. Fla. No. 1:15-cv- 23070-MGC D) (preliminary injunction orders entered by the court on September 2, 2015 and September 14, 2015).
The CFPB took action against World Law Group for running a debt-relief scheme that charged consumers exorbitant, illegal upfront fees. In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the Bureau alleges that the debt-relief scheme falsely promised consumers a team of attorneys to help negotiate debt settlements with creditors, failed to provide legal representation, and rarely settled consumers’ debts. World Law is alleged to have taken $67 million from at least 21,000 consumers before providing any debt-relief services. The Bureau alleges that the conduct violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, and the CFPA’s prohibition against unfair and deceptive acts and practices. The Court issued the preliminary injunction because it found that the Bureau is likely to prevail and that the public interest is served by granting the Order. The case will proceed until the court makes a final determination or the parties settle the matter.
In The Matter of Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC (File No. 2015-CFPB-0023) (consent order entered September 9, 2015).
The CFPB took action against Portfolio Recovery Associates (PRA), one of the largest debt buyers in the country. As a debt buyer, PRA purchases delinquent or charged-off accounts for a fraction of the value of the debt, but has the right to collect the full amount claimed by the original lender. The Bureau found PRA bought debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacking documentation, or unenforceable. Without verifying the debt, the company collected payments by pressuring consumers with false statements and churning out lawsuits using robo-signed court documents. PRA is required to pay $19 million in consumer relief and $8 million civil monetary penalties.
In The Matter of Encore Capital Group, Inc., Midland Funding, LLC, Midland Credit Management, Inc. and Asset Acceptance Capital Corp. (File No. 2015-CFPB- 0022) (consent order entered September 9, 2015).
The CFPB took action against Encore Capital Group, one of the nation’s two largest debt buyers. The Bureau found violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act related to Encore’s collection of bad debts, litigation practices, and other collections activities. Specifically, the Bureau found that Encore threatened and deceived consumers to collect on debts the company should have known were inaccurate or had other problems. The Bureau ordered Encore to cease reselling debts, stop collections on $125 million worth of judgments, and halt collection of future debts that cannot be verified. Encore is required to pay up to $42 million in consumer relief and $10 million in civil monetary penalties.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Universal Debt & Payment Solutions, LLC, et al. (N.D.GA No. 1:15-CV-0859) (complaint filed March 26, 2015; preliminary injunction issued April 7, 2015).
On April 7, 2015, the Bureau obtained a preliminary injunction that froze the assets and enjoined unlawful conduct related to a phantom debt collection scheme. The Bureau’s suit against a group of seven debt collection agencies, six individual debt collectors, four payment processors, and a telephone marketing service provider, alleges violations of the FDCPA and the CFPA’s prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices, and providing substantial assistance to unfair or deceptive conduct. The complaint alleges that the individuals, acting through a network of corporate entities, use threats and harassment to collect “phantom” debt from consumers. Phantom debt is debt consumers do not actually owe or debt that is not payable to those attempting to collect it. Their misconduct was facilitated by the substantial assistance of the payment processors and the telephone service provider. The Bureau is seeking a permanent injunction, redress for consumers, and a monetary penalty.

About Stephen
As an undergraduate at Pennsylvania State University, I served as an infantry soldier in the Pennsylvania National Guard and as a cadet in the R.O.T.C. My major in Criminal Justice led me to attend the New England School of Law in Boston. Once there, I honed in on bankruptcy law and was a scholarship recipient for “Securities Regulation.” I followed that with an internship at the Boston Stock Exchange and a clerkship for McGarthy & Ged. During this time, I learned how to help people find financial relief through legal action.
