NOTES TO
UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

NOTE 1 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Organization
- Bioethics,
Ltd. (“the Company”) was organized under the laws of
the State of Nevada on July 26, 1990.  The Company has
not commenced planned principal operations and is considered a
development stage company as defined in ASC Topic No. 915. The
Company was organized to provide a vehicle for participating in
potentially profitable business ventures which may become available
through the personal contacts of, and at the complete discretion
of, the Company’s officers and directors.  The
Company has, at the present time, not paid any dividends and any
dividends that may be paid in the future will depend upon the
financial requirements of the Company and other relevant
factors.

 

Condensed
Financial Statements - The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company
without audit.  In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows at September 30, 2010 and 2009 and for
the periods then ended have been made.

 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been
condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company’s December 31, 2009 audited financial
statements.  The results of operations for the periods
ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results for the full year.

 

NOTE 2 -
CAPITAL STOCK

 

Common
Stock - In July
1990, in connection with its organization, the Company issued
1,000,000 shares of its previously authorized but unissued common
stock.  Total proceeds from the sale of stock amounted to
$1,000 (or $.001 per share).

 

In May
1998, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its previously
authorized but unissued common stock.  Total proceeds
from the sale of stock amounted to $40,000 (or $.004 per
share).  The issuance of common stock resulted in a
change in control of the Company.

 

Capital
Contribution - During
the year ended December 31, 2009, a shareholder of the Company
contributed $17,776 to the Company.

 

NOTE 3 -
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

Management
Compensation - During the
nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not
pay any compensation to its officers and directors.

 

Office
Space -
The Company has not had a need to rent office space.  An
officer/shareholder of the Company is allowing the Company to use
his home as a mailing address, as needed, at no expense to the
Company.

NOTES TO
UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

 

NOTE 3 -
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

 

Note
Payable - In
January 2010, the Company borrowed $25,000 from a stockholder of
the Company pursuant to an unsecured promissory
note.  The note is due on demand and accrues interest at
6% per annum.  At September 30, 2010 accrued interest was
$1,052.

 

NOTE 4 -
GOING CONCERN

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a
going concern.  However, the Company has incurred losses
since its inception and has no on-going
operations.  These factors raise substantial doubt about
the ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern.  In this regard, management is proposing to
raise any necessary additional funds not provided by operations
through additional sales of its common stock and loans from
stockholders.  There is no assurance that the Company
will be successful in raising this additional capital or in
achieving profitable operations.  The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of these uncertainties.
