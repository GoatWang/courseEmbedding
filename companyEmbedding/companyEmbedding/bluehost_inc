Usage Policies





How much disk space and bandwidth is included with my plan?
For packages supporting unmetered disk space or data transfer (bandwidth), we do not have defined limitations. These resources are "unmetered", meaning you are not billed according to the amount of disk space or bandwidth used. While of course these resources are not infinite, we believe our customers should have all the resources necessary to build an online presence and 99.95% of customers will have more than enough disk space and bandwidth to meet their needs.
That said, we do require all customers to be fully compliant with our Terms of Service and utilize disk space and bandwidth in a manner consistent with the normal operation of a website. While rare, we occasionally constrain accounts utilizing more resources than should be the case in the normal operation of a personal or small business website.
How do you determine "normal" operation?
We regularly examine customer bandwidth and disk space utilization data in a series of statistical analyses and use the results to define "normal". Although these tests vary from month to month, one thing remains constant: 99.95% of our customers fall into "normal" range. If your account's bandwidth or disk space utilization causes any concern, you will receive an email asking you to reduce usage. We strive to provide at least 48 hours notice to allow customers to make adjustments before we take any corrective action.
It is very rare for a customer to exceed normal usage while managing a website. Typically, customers only experience issues if they use their accounts for storage (for example large multimedia files) or file sharing. Our hosting services are not intended to support these activities, and in accordance with our Terms of Service your disk space and bandwidth usage must be integrated into the normal operation of a website. We offer various plans that better address high bandwidth and large storage requirements. Please contact us for details.
What constraints exist on websites, domain names, or email?
For plans or packages featuring unlimited websites, domains, or email accounts, we do not enforce any official limitations. Customers are able to utilize as many of these features as they wish. That said, these are of course not infinite resources and there are inherent maximums associated with the technology powering them. For example, while email account creation is unlimited, these rely on the file storage available on the account. Therefore customers need to be operating within the Terms of Service to ensure resources are available to fully enable email functionality. Customers operating within the Terms of Service have yet to come up against technical boundaries for email, domains, or websites.

Free Domain Policy


If you register a domain with Bluehost when signing up for a hosting account, there is a domain fee that is non-refundable. This not only covers our costs, but ensures that you won't lose your domain name. Regardless of the status of your hosting service, you'll be free to manage it, transfer it after any required lock periods, or simply point it elsewhere at your convenience. You retain ownership of your domain until the end of its registration period unless you elect to extend it.

The IT department also maintains a centralized data center at this location. The facility is spread over 50,000 square feet and contains hundreds of servers. The company hosts over a million domains. Additionally, Bluehost has two other secondary facilities, one in Provo and the other in Orem, together totaling over 20,000 square feet. The secondary locations do not host client data, but do host employee offices. Technicians work directly from the primary data center. The company does not offer any cloud computing services and has no plans of expanding into that market at this time.

The computer operations team manages server deployment and purchases, as well as data center design and build outs. Additionally, the software team is responsible for programming efforts and shares information security management with the network operations team.

The company offers shared Linux servers to customers. However, they also work with Apache Servers and UNIX. Additionally, EMC Data Domain is the primary data storage tool. Other prominent technologies include Microsoft products, LAMP, Ruby on Rails, WordPress blogging tools and VMware.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Bluehost Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 35 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Bluehost Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 35 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Bluehost is a web hosting company owned by Endurance International Group. It is one of the 20 largest[1] web hosts, collectively hosting well over 2 million domains with its sister companies, HostMonster, FastDomain and iPage.[2] The company operates its servers in-house in a 50,000 square feet (4,600 m2) facility in Provo, Utah, which is now shared with sister company HostMonster.[3] Bluehost employs over 700 people in its Utah facility[4].
Bluehost was among those studied in the analysis of web-based hosting services in collaborative online learning programs.[5]

History[edit]
Matt Heaton was inspired to start Bluehost in 1996 when he was working on a web statistics program project of his own creation and discovered that web hosting services at the time left much to be desired. He believed web hosts could offer more space and be more convenient to use, and he set out to fix that, creating two other web hosts, 50megs.com and 0catch.com, before finally settling on Bluehost in 2003. [6]
In 2009, BlueHost introduced a new feature to all customers – CPU throttling. CPU throttling (at BlueHost and similar hosting services) simply refers to the process of reducing user’s CPU usage in whenever the particular user is pulling “too much” server resources at one time. At that particular time, BlueHost would freeze (or drastically reduce) client sites' CPU usage substantially. This effectively shut down clients' websites hosted on the BlueHost server for several hours throughout the day.
In 2010, BlueHost was acquired by Endurance International Group.
In June 2011, company founder Matt Heaton announced on his blog that he was stepping down as CEO to focus on the company hosting platform's design and technical structure, while COO Dan Handy took over as CEO.[7]
In 2013, Bluehost now offers VPS and dedicated server hosting.[8]
In January, 2015, Endurance International Group appointed Mike Olson to be CEO of Bluehost, as Dan Handy moved to enterprise-wide mobile development for small businesses.[9]
Controversies[edit]
In March 2009, Bluehost appeared in a Newsweek article that condemned the hosting company for censoring the web pages of some of their customers who were believed to be citizens of countries that the US Government had listed as rogue states.[10]
In February 2011, Bluehost took down a religious website that they were hosting on its servers after receiving thousands of complaints when that website posted comments blaming gays and lesbians for an earthquake in New Zealand.[11]
Security breach[edit]
In March 2015, Bluehost was hacked by Syrian Electronic Army. Also hacked were Justhost, Hostgator, Hostmonster and Fastdomain, all owned by Endurance International Group. SEA claimed that these services were hosting terrorist websites.[12][13] SEA posted screenshots of the attack on Twitter.[13][14]

Bluehost is a web hosting company owned by Endurance International Group. It is one of the 20 largest[1] web hosts, collectively hosting well over 2 million domains with its sister companies, HostMonster, FastDomain and iPage.[2] The company operates its servers in-house in a 50,000 square feet (4,600 m2) facility in Provo, Utah, which is now shared with sister company HostMonster.[3] Bluehost employs over 700 people in its Utah facility[4].
Bluehost was among those studied in the analysis of web-based hosting services in collaborative online learning programs.[5]

History[edit]
Matt Heaton was inspired to start Bluehost in 1996 when he was working on a web statistics program project of his own creation and discovered that web hosting services at the time left much to be desired. He believed web hosts could offer more space and be more convenient to use, and he set out to fix that, creating two other web hosts, 50megs.com and 0catch.com, before finally settling on Bluehost in 2003. [6]
In 2009, BlueHost introduced a new feature to all customers – CPU throttling. CPU throttling (at BlueHost and similar hosting services) simply refers to the process of reducing user’s CPU usage in whenever the particular user is pulling “too much” server resources at one time. At that particular time, BlueHost would freeze (or drastically reduce) client sites' CPU usage substantially. This effectively shut down clients' websites hosted on the BlueHost server for several hours throughout the day.
In 2010, BlueHost was acquired by Endurance International Group.
In June 2011, company founder Matt Heaton announced on his blog that he was stepping down as CEO to focus on the company hosting platform's design and technical structure, while COO Dan Handy took over as CEO.[7]
In 2013, Bluehost now offers VPS and dedicated server hosting.[8]
In January, 2015, Endurance International Group appointed Mike Olson to be CEO of Bluehost, as Dan Handy moved to enterprise-wide mobile development for small businesses.[9]
Controversies[edit]
In March 2009, Bluehost appeared in a Newsweek article that condemned the hosting company for censoring the web pages of some of their customers who were believed to be citizens of countries that the US Government had listed as rogue states.[10]
In February 2011, Bluehost took down a religious website that they were hosting on its servers after receiving thousands of complaints when that website posted comments blaming gays and lesbians for an earthquake in New Zealand.[11]
Security breach[edit]
In March 2015, Bluehost was hacked by Syrian Electronic Army. Also hacked were Justhost, Hostgator, Hostmonster and Fastdomain, all owned by Endurance International Group. SEA claimed that these services were hosting terrorist websites.[12][13] SEA posted screenshots of the attack on Twitter.[13][14]

Free Domain Policy


If you register a domain with Bluehost when signing up for a hosting account, there is a domain fee that is non-refundable. This not only covers our costs, but ensures that you won't lose your domain name. Regardless of the status of your hosting service, you'll be free to manage it, transfer it after any required lock periods, or simply point it elsewhere at your convenience. You retain ownership of your domain until the end of its registration period unless you elect to extend it.

Making Cloud Effortless
The cloud can seem complex and intimidating. So we reinvented it.





Safer

On the cloud your website is more reliable. Your data is automatically mirrored across three distinct devices. Should hardware issues arise at one, our failover technology automatically designates one copy of your website to keep functioning while the other two copies work to rebuild.















Faster

No more long load times. Along with premium hardware and low-density servers, our cloud platform includes a varnish caching layer and global cdn to ensure your server resources are focused where they should be. Static website content is managed more efficiently so dynamic requests can be processed quicker than ever.









Simpler

Understand your site's performance at a glance. Simple yet useful dashboards provide a quick view into usage trends, page download speed, uptime, global reach, and more. And with instant resource management, you'll never need to worry about your site going down due to traffic spikes again.















Bigger

More web traffic should never slow you down. As your online presence grows, amp up your cloud usage with the click of a button. Either pick a more powerful plan, or add CPU and RAM a la carte as needed. All without having to worry about reboots, cryptic usage fees, or downtime.










Features
 swipe 



Monthly Billing
Add resources in a simple, no-nonsense way while avoiding any surprising usage fees at the end of the month.



Automated Migration
Already have a shared hosting account? Enjoy the power of the cloud in minutes with a seamless transition to our new platform.



Data Mirroring
Cloud Sites automatically distributes three mirrored copies of your data across multiple devices to ensure saftey and protection.



Integrated Caching
Enjoy automatically accelerated web content from day one with an advanced, customized NGINX/Varnish Caching configuration.



Intuitive Dashboard
Monitor your site's performance by tracking traffic, load speed, global reach, and more from one centralized location.



Resource Monitoring
Easily identify when more resources are needed to support your website, then power up with just the click of a button.



Fully-Managed
Our experts deal with maintaining languages, security patches, port access, and any issues that may arise.



Instant Scaling
Scale up CPU and RAM at any time and without a reboot. Our OpenStack-powered backend distribution technology makes it easy.



Automated Failover
If a hardware device falters, your site is rapidly switched over to another device to provide maximum uptime for your site.

Bluehost is a web hosting company owned by Endurance International Group. It is one of the 20 largest[1] web hosts, collectively hosting well over 2 million domains with its sister companies, HostMonster, FastDomain and iPage.[2] The company operates its servers in-house in a 50,000 square feet (4,600 m2) facility in Provo, Utah, which is now shared with sister company HostMonster.[3] Bluehost employs over 700 people in its Utah facility[4].
Bluehost was among those studied in the analysis of web-based hosting services in collaborative online learning programs.[5]

History[edit]
Matt Heaton was inspired to start Bluehost in 1996 when he was working on a web statistics program project of his own creation and discovered that web hosting services at the time left much to be desired. He believed web hosts could offer more space and be more convenient to use, and he set out to fix that, creating two other web hosts, 50megs.com and 0catch.com, before finally settling on Bluehost in 2003. [6]
In 2009, BlueHost introduced a new feature to all customers – CPU throttling. CPU throttling (at BlueHost and similar hosting services) simply refers to the process of reducing user’s CPU usage in whenever the particular user is pulling “too much” server resources at one time. At that particular time, BlueHost would freeze (or drastically reduce) client sites' CPU usage substantially. This effectively shut down clients' websites hosted on the BlueHost server for several hours throughout the day.
In 2010, BlueHost was acquired by Endurance International Group.
In June 2011, company founder Matt Heaton announced on his blog that he was stepping down as CEO to focus on the company hosting platform's design and technical structure, while COO Dan Handy took over as CEO.[7]
In 2013, Bluehost now offers VPS and dedicated server hosting.[8]
In January, 2015, Endurance International Group appointed Mike Olson to be CEO of Bluehost, as Dan Handy moved to enterprise-wide mobile development for small businesses.[9]
Controversies[edit]
In March 2009, Bluehost appeared in a Newsweek article that condemned the hosting company for censoring the web pages of some of their customers who were believed to be citizens of countries that the US Government had listed as rogue states.[10]
In February 2011, Bluehost took down a religious website that they were hosting on its servers after receiving thousands of complaints when that website posted comments blaming gays and lesbians for an earthquake in New Zealand.[11]
Security breach[edit]
In March 2015, Bluehost was hacked by Syrian Electronic Army. Also hacked were Justhost, Hostgator, Hostmonster and Fastdomain, all owned by Endurance International Group. SEA claimed that these services were hosting terrorist websites.[12][13] SEA posted screenshots of the attack on Twitter.[13][14]
