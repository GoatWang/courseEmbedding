Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.

Sample Case Study
Learn more about how Enhance contributed to the success of our clients products.


 



Hot Buns™ | Hair Accessory
 
 
 


 

The Challenge
When Taylor Baldwin noticed a growing fad on YouTube of creating fuller hair buns using tube socks, she knew there was an untapped market that girls and women alike would love.
As a successful entrepreneur working as an on-air host and pitch woman in the as seen on TV industry, she began exploring solutions that would work and wanted to introduce the product in a commercial she would produce.
But how do you develop and configure a product with the features and benefits that would appeal to a broad market?
 
 
 


The Solution
It was at the Housewares Show when we initially sat down with her to explore her concept. Within a week our designers ordered nearly every hair product being sold on the market, getting immersed in the industry and testing what worked (and what didn’t) on the female staff members in our office.
Then, working in concert with Ms. Baldwin, our designers sketched numerous solutions and began crude prototyping to test the various ways the product could be constructed.  Finally, Taylor and our designers were able to select the best embodiment to be sold on television and Enhance completed prototyping to be used in the commercial test.
The good news is the product has been a hit, and we are delighted to be a part of making this product a success!
