History[edit]
Sanmina was founded by Jure Sola and Milan Mandarić in 1980 as a printed circuit board manufacturer. During the 1980s, the company expanded into manufacturing backplanes and subassemblies [2] for the telecommunications industry. During the 1990s, the company grew significantly, producing complete products for major OEM companies and completing a number of strategic acquisitions. Jure Sola became CEO and Chairman of Sanmina in 1991. The company completed an initial public offering on NASDAQ in 1993.
Merger and name changes[edit]
In December 2001, Sanmina merged with SCI Systems of Huntsville, Alabama, for $6 billion in cash, stock, and debt. Although Sanmina was only half as large as SCI at the time, it was in a better cash position because its core telecommunications business was performing well, whereas SCI's lower-margin businesses such as personal computer manufacturing, were struggling.[3] Shortly after, Sanmina-SCI bought E-M Solutions, a bankrupt Fremont, California electronics manufacturer, for $110 million in cash.[4] Then in early 2002, Sanmina acquired Viking Interworks of Rancho Santa Margarita for $15 million ($10.9 million in cash and 390,000 shares of Sanmina stock worth $10.26 per share at the time).[5]
On November 15, 2012, the company changed its name to Sanmina.[6]
On July 2, 2015, the company announced that it had acquired the CertainSource Technology Group.
Change of Leadership[edit]
In July 2017, the Sanmina Board of Directors unanimously voted to appoint Bob Eulau as the new CEO of the company. Eulau is scheduled to replace co-founder Jure Sola as the CEO effective October 2, 2017. After this change, Sola will be assuming the role of Executive Chairman of the Board and continue to maintain a presence in the company.[7]
Operations[edit]
In 2015, the San Jose, California-based company had 38,417 employees in over 27 countries on six continents. It serves clients in the fields of communications, computing, multimedia, semiconductors, defense, aerospace, medical applications, and automotive technology. It provides consulting, design, engineering, logistics, new product introduction, assembly, machining, and fabrication, to produce printed circuit boards, backplanes, electrical cables, injection-molded plastics, enclosures and frames, optics.

Sanmina CEO Jure Sola to step down after 26 years in the role to be executive chairman
Sanmina Corp.  said Thursday that it will appoint Chief Financial Officer Bob Eulau as chief executive officer, effective Oct. 2. He will replace current CEO Jure Sola, who will assume the role of executive chairman on Oct. 2. Sola has been CEO since 1991, and Eulau has been CFO since September 2009. "Bob and I have collaborated for the last eight years and he has been instrumental in the successful transformation of Sanmina, making this a perfect time for him to become Sanmina's next chief executive officer," Sola said. The electronics contract manufacturer's stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has gained 4.4% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  has climbed 8.7%.

History[edit]
Sanmina was founded by Jure Sola and Milan Mandarić in 1980 as a printed circuit board manufacturer. During the 1980s, the company expanded into manufacturing backplanes and subassemblies [2] for the telecommunications industry. During the 1990s, the company grew significantly, producing complete products for major OEM companies and completing a number of strategic acquisitions. Jure Sola became CEO and Chairman of Sanmina in 1991. The company completed an initial public offering on NASDAQ in 1993.
Merger and name changes[edit]
In December 2001, Sanmina merged with SCI Systems of Huntsville, Alabama, for $6 billion in cash, stock, and debt. Although Sanmina was only half as large as SCI at the time, it was in a better cash position because its core telecommunications business was performing well, whereas SCI's lower-margin businesses such as personal computer manufacturing, were struggling.[3] Shortly after, Sanmina-SCI bought E-M Solutions, a bankrupt Fremont, California electronics manufacturer, for $110 million in cash.[4] Then in early 2002, Sanmina acquired Viking Interworks of Rancho Santa Margarita for $15 million ($10.9 million in cash and 390,000 shares of Sanmina stock worth $10.26 per share at the time).[5]
On November 15, 2012, the company changed its name to Sanmina.[6]
On July 2, 2015, the company announced that it had acquired the CertainSource Technology Group.
Change of Leadership[edit]
In July 2017, the Sanmina Board of Directors unanimously voted to appoint Bob Eulau as the new CEO of the company. Eulau is scheduled to replace co-founder Jure Sola as the CEO effective October 2, 2017. After this change, Sola will be assuming the role of Executive Chairman of the Board and continue to maintain a presence in the company.[7]
Operations[edit]
In 2015, the San Jose, California-based company had 38,417 employees in over 27 countries on six continents. It serves clients in the fields of communications, computing, multimedia, semiconductors, defense, aerospace, medical applications, and automotive technology. It provides consulting, design, engineering, logistics, new product introduction, assembly, machining, and fabrication, to produce printed circuit boards, backplanes, electrical cables, injection-molded plastics, enclosures and frames, optics.
