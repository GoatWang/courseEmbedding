History[edit]
They are also the oldest outdoor advertising company in the United States as their roots trace back to the three companies that merged into the current incarnation: Foster & Kleiser (1901-1986), Patrick Media Outdoor (1986-1995) and Eller Media Company (1959-1997). F&K changed their name to Patrick after Metromedia sold the company to General Electric, which in turn was acquired by Eller in 1995. It would change its name to Clear Channel Outdoor in 2001 after the company acquired it.
Along the way the company acquired the following:

Universal Outdoor (Naegele, Derse)
Paxton Outdoor
Ackerley Media
Badger Outdoor
ABC Outdoor
Hansen Outdoor

In November 2002, Clear Channel Outdoor announced that it would move its Los Angeles headquarters to a site in the Harbor Gateway neighborhood, in the Harbor Gateway Center being developed by Boeing Realty Corp.[4]
In June 2003, Clear Channel Outdoor selected Arbitron Inc. (NYSE: ARB) to supply it with local market consumer information and software services in all U. S. markets served by Clear Channel Outdoor.[5]
In November 2005, Clear Channel Outdoor announced the initial public offering of 35,000,000 shares of Class A common stock of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings at a price of $18.00 per share, for a total offering of $630,000,000.[6]
In May 2006, Clear Channel Outdoor Launched UK's 1st Outdoor Digital Billboard Network. The 10 billboards measuring 5.3 metres long by 2.5 metres wide (approximately 48-sheet sized) deployed a new, energy-efficient technology.[7]
The parent company changed its name to iHeartMedia in September 2014. The outdoor advertising unit retained the Clear Channel name to protect that trademark; however the company operates an "iHeartBillboards" blog.[8]
In a mammoth $458.5 million deal on January 12 of 2016, Lamar Advertising Company took over 5 major U.S. city markets that were held by Clear Channel.

History[edit]
They are also the oldest outdoor advertising company in the United States as their roots trace back to the three companies that merged into the current incarnation: Foster & Kleiser (1901-1986), Patrick Media Outdoor (1986-1995) and Eller Media Company (1959-1997). F&K changed their name to Patrick after Metromedia sold the company to General Electric, which in turn was acquired by Eller in 1995. It would change its name to Clear Channel Outdoor in 2001 after the company acquired it.
Along the way the company acquired the following:

Universal Outdoor (Naegele, Derse)
Paxton Outdoor
Ackerley Media
Badger Outdoor
ABC Outdoor
Hansen Outdoor

In November 2002, Clear Channel Outdoor announced that it would move its Los Angeles headquarters to a site in the Harbor Gateway neighborhood, in the Harbor Gateway Center being developed by Boeing Realty Corp.[4]
In June 2003, Clear Channel Outdoor selected Arbitron Inc. (NYSE: ARB) to supply it with local market consumer information and software services in all U. S. markets served by Clear Channel Outdoor.[5]
In November 2005, Clear Channel Outdoor announced the initial public offering of 35,000,000 shares of Class A common stock of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings at a price of $18.00 per share, for a total offering of $630,000,000.[6]
In May 2006, Clear Channel Outdoor Launched UK's 1st Outdoor Digital Billboard Network. The 10 billboards measuring 5.3 metres long by 2.5 metres wide (approximately 48-sheet sized) deployed a new, energy-efficient technology.[7]
The parent company changed its name to iHeartMedia in September 2014. The outdoor advertising unit retained the Clear Channel name to protect that trademark; however the company operates an "iHeartBillboards" blog.[8]
In a mammoth $458.5 million deal on January 12 of 2016, Lamar Advertising Company took over 5 major U.S. city markets that were held by Clear Channel.

Style Scores:



B Value | F Growth | F Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
