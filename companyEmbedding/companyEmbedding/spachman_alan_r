Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

About Us
As a multi-line Trusted Choice® agency, Belmont Insurance Services, Inc. offers competitive personal and commercial coverages through the nation’s top-rated insurance companies. 

        Former insurance company founder and president, Alan R. Spachman founded Belmont to offer the highest quality insurance coverage, including but not limited to commercial, personal, life and health insurance. 

        Belmont’s company philosophy is simple…to display genuine care for our clients by providing knowledge, service and value in everything we do.
Knowledge…
Our insurance professionals have led and served at several of the country’s most highly respected insurance companies. The national experience and local industry knowledge that our agents have helps us offer insurance programs that provide comprehensive coverage without the burden of excessive costs and fees. Unlike company-employed agents, we can provide personalized insurance advice and recommend coverage from multiple insurance companies, including specialty insurers that focus on unique situations and exposures with innovative insurance products and services. 

Service…
When you contact Belmont, one of our licensed agents will ask the necessary questions to understand your unique situation and respond to any coverage or technical questions you may have. From there, we will develop multiple insurance quotations and fully explain the advantages and disadvantages of each option so you make the most informed decision possible. We will take all the time necessary to answer your questions and explain the options and features of the insurance programs we recommend. 

Value…
Our goal is to provide value by addressing coverage needs with highly competitive prices and every available premium discount applied. Typically, we advise our clients to purchase full coverage, comprehensive insurance programs from companies with the highest financial strength ratings. In these cases we offer insurance products from companies with the lowest costs and the most flexible payment terms available to meet the needs of every budget. At Belmont, we seek to promise Knowledge, Service and Value in everything we do.
