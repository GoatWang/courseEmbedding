Catchpoint Announces Introduction of Guided Intelligence to the Catchpoint Platform
Jun 29 17
Catchpoint announced the introduction of Guided Intelligence to the Catchpoint Platform. Guided Intelligence is a suite of algorithmic features that helps IT and DevOps teams quickly gain actionable insights from Catchpoint’s vast performance monitoring data, reducing Mean Time to Identify (MTTI) and improving delivery of digital services. Guided Intelligence automatically sifts through the vast amount of elements traversing the internet such as the network, third-party providers, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that can degrade application performance and disrupt the customer or end-user experience. By synthesizing this data from Catchpoint’s geographically extensive array of vantage points, Guided Intelligence identifies likely root causes and predicts IT and business outcomes. Trio of Guided Intelligence Features: Guided Intelligence’s trio of new features includes: Smartboard: Automatically highlights issues impacting user performance in a single, interactive view, providing IT professionals with a quick summary and contextual information without the need to sift through multiple analyses. Outage Analyzer: Identifies regional performance problems in all relevant geographies using predictive models from real user data, enabling IT users to understand the scope and extent of an outage with the click of a button. User Engagement Estimator: Creates “what if” scenarios to understand the impact of potential changes on performance and business metrics such as revenue. Traditional solutions gather data on internal datacenter elements, correlating them to application performance. While this capability is important, today’s introduction reflects Catchpoint's belief that traditional approaches must evolve to a more user experience-centric approach known as digital experience monitoring.


AutoScout24 Chooses Catchpoint to Help Offer Customers Best Web Experience
Feb 20 17
Catchpoint announced that AutoScout24 is now using the company's performance analytics solution. In order to bring together the numerous vendors and buyers of vehicles, the speed and performance of the Web appearance for AutoScout24 is crucial. AutoScout24 wants to offer its customers a great user experience and is always looking for technologies that will further improve the experience. Through the Catchpoint Waterfall Charts, AutoScout24 can identify and isolate the various first and third party elements on its page. This is how the performance teams see which items have an impact on the user experience and can respond immediately. In addition, AutoScout24 uses Catchpoint Waterfall's film strip feature to create performance scenarios. The feature shows what the user sees when playing different page elements. This means that all decision-makers can immediately understand the effects of the different metrics recorded. With the help of Catchpoint, AutoScout24 isolates, repairs and removes page elements that could affect online customer experience and significantly improves its loading time. With old data from test metrics that Catchpoint stores for up to three years, AutoScout24 can also compare the data with older performance values.

Catchpoint Secures $3.2 Million in Series A Funding


Rapid Customer Growth and Product Innovation Mark First Year since Solution Debut
NEW YORK, New York, March 12, 2013
Catchpoint Systems, Inc., a provider of innovative web and infrastructure monitoring solutions, today announced it has closed a $3.2 million series A financing round. First launching its product in 2010, Catchpoint ran 2.9 billion tests for more than 100 customers in 2012 and boasts consistent revenue growth – doubling year-over-year revenue last year. Led by Battery Ventures, the financing will be used to accelerate the company’s growth and product development.
“We were actively looking for the next big thing in infrastructure so investing in Catchpoint was an easy decision,” stated Neeraj Agrawal, general partner, Battery Ventures. “It offers a mature, experienced leadership team with a proven product suite, impressive growth and a strategic vision for what lies ahead. We are confident that Catchpoint will continue to disrupt the performance monitoring industry and quickly become the dominant player.”  Battery has deep expertise in Catchpoint’s market, including investments in Akamai, BladeLogic and Tealium.  Battery is committed to finding and funding innovative companies in the New York area, and Catchpoint is the tenth such company in its active portfolio.
Founded in September 2008 by four former DoubleClick/Google executives, Catchpoint helps organizations proactively monitor the end-to-end performance and availability of their online systems – improving the speed, reliability and availability of online services to boost customer satisfaction, lower the cost of quality management and protect revenue. Delivering real-time analytics, its web performance and application monitoring tools empower companies to measure the behavior of their services from multiple vantage points to better understand performance and the factors impacting it.
“Catchpoint offers a truly comprehensive, high-end enterprise solution for IT professionals who care about performance,” said Imad Mouline, application performance management industry veteran and current CTO of Everbridge.  “Catchpoint delivers when it comes to all-important details like consistent data quality, complete change logs, comprehensive test management, support for the increasingly rapid changes in web technologies and development platforms, and more.  In this industry, it is the little things that can make a striking difference to the bottom line – the Catchpoint team learned that through years of using such tools before deciding to reinvent performance management from the ground up.”
Catchpoint will leverage the investment primarily to accelerate its market-changing product development roadmap. It will also support aggressive recruiting, further growth of the company’s successful sales team and continued market expansion.
“Our team is passionate about monitoring. Having once been on the buyer side gives us an edge on innovation as we think and design our products from a customer perspective.  Working hand-in-hand with so many companies that understand the seriousness of performance monitoring because of its impact on millions of users is rewarding,” said Mehdi Daoudi, CEO and founder of Catchpoint. “This first strategic investment from Battery Ventures will help us fast-track our product development plans and bolster our continued expansion so we can change the way IT monitors and resolves issues that might have a detrimental impact on critical online services and, therefore, the business.”
With this investment, Neeraj Agrawal of Battery Ventures will join the Catchpoint Board of Directors.
