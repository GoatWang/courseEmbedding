Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. Announces the Filing of New Patent for Biologic Product Called MemoryMune
Jun 5 17
Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. announced the filing of a new patent for a biologic product called "MemoryMune". The patent describes methods, protocols and compositions of matter useful for stimulation of anticancer immune responses. In one embodiment of the invention, culturing of buffy coat cells is performed in an environment resembling non-physiological conditions. Buffy coat derived products are subsequently harvested, concentrated, and added to a culture of monocytes and lymphocytes. Conditioned media from this second culture is subsequently utilized as an injectable solution for stimulation of anticancer immunity. MemoryMune therefore is a product derived from a two-step culture process of donor blood cells. MemoryMune is being developed with the purpose of reawakening dormant immune memory cells by mimicking a process called "homeostatic immune expansion". It is known that many cancer patients possess memory T cells that enter the tumor, however, once inside the tumor these cells are inactivated. MemoryMune contains a unique combination of growth factors specific for immune system cells called "cytokines".

(  OTCQB :  TSOI ) announced today the signing of a Distribution Agreement with S4S (UK) Limited for exclusive distribution rights in the United States to market the U.S. patented and FDA cleared titratable sleep appliance hardware sold under the trademark "Sleepwell™"."Today was a major achievement and milestone for S4S and our ever popular Sleepwell™ appliance, which has been so successful in Europe," stated Matt Everatt, Technical Director of S4S (UK) Limited. "Our signing of this agreement with TSI to exclusively distribute the Sleepwell appliance hardware will give US dentists a new product that can help individuals suffering from snoring and sleep apnea."Dr. Barry Glassman, VP of Education and Training of Therapeutic Solutions International, stated, "This proven technology is a very attractive choice for both the dentist providing oral appliance therapy, and for the patient seeking an alternative treatment for sleep disturbed breathing, compared to the traditional therapies including surgery and CPAP.""We at TSI are excited about bringing this quality yet cost effective appliance choice to the United States," said CEO Tim Dixon of Therapeutic Solutions International, who added, "According to the US Department of Health and Human Services the prevalence of sleep apnea in the US population is similar to asthma (20 million patients) and diabetes (23.6 million patients). We look forward to working with dentists and dental laboratories in bringing this product to the patient."Sleepwell™ components are used to manufacture the appliance in a dental laboratory using a bilaminate material customized to the patient's teeth with a special soft inner lining for maximum comfort and retention. The appliance also incorporates a specially designed component made from medical grade 316 Stainless Steel, which ensures that the lower jaw is held in a forward position while permitting the wearer side-to-side movement during sleep. Therapeutic Solutions International is also a global manufacturer of the chairside anterior midpoint stop appliance (AMPSA) devices marketed internationally under the trade names Migran-X® and AMPSA CS®, which have helped countless patients prevent debilitating migraine and tension headache pain, bruxism, clenching, grinding, and TMJ disorders. The Migran-X® and AMPSA CS® devices are the most effective non-drug US FDA cleared dental method of migraine prevention on the market today.About Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc.The Company's corporate website is www.therapeuticsolutionsint.com.

While great progress has been made in developing drugs that stimulate the immune system to recognize and kill tumors, a major pitfall of current approaches is that tumors produce chemicals and oxidative stress that suppresses the immune system, thus limiting efficacy of immune therapies," said Timothy Dixon, CEO of Therapeutics Solutions International, Inc.Pterostilbene, which is chemically related to resveratrol, has been published to possess anticancer2,3, antioxidant4, and anti-inflammatory activities5. Through the filing of the recent patent, the company is exploring whether its lead product, ProJuvenol™, may be useful as a nutraceutical adjuvant to conventional cancer immunotherapies. Timothy Dixon, CEO of TSOI, added, "The importance of proper nutrition in the context of immunotherapy cannot be overstated. Studies on one of the original cancer immunotherapies, interleukin-2, demonstrated that efficacy was related to anti-oxidant content in the patients at time of therapy6. Accordingly, we are seeking through the current work to identify whether our currently marketed product, ProJuvenol™, may be utilized as part of an integrative approach to building up the immune response of cancer patients."1 Couzin-Frankel J.
