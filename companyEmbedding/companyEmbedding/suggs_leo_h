He understands the opportunities and challenges associated with the LTL industry, and has first-hand knowledge of merger and acquisition considerations and strategies. Mr. Suggs previously served on the Board of Directors of privately-held Greatwide Logistics Services, a provider of transportation and logistics management services, from July 2011 to December 2014, and The Kenan Advantage Group, Inc., a privately-held tank truck hauler and logistics provider, from July 2010 to July 2015. We believe that Mr. Suggs is invaluable to our Board as an advisor on logistics services and LTL operations.
