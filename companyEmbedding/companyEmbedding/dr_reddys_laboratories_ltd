The June quarter saw some old ones carry over and a new one getting added.  The goods and services tax (GST) is the latest spoilsport, as distributors lowered their inventory. The company’s India sales declined as a result.The US market was where price erosion got worse, Dr Reddy’s management said in a call. Sales declined by 2.6% sequentially and by 4% over a year ago. This is despite the launch of four new products during the quarter. The management said that price cuts were more than expected, due to more consolidation in the distribution channels. They are hopeful it won’t get worse but are not confident. Resolution of quality problems at its plants and getting key product approvals for the US market should help but the event and its timing are uncertain.Sales in other markets were healthy during the quarter, but pressure in its main markets meant that its costs were spread over a smaller base. It continued to invest on R&D (research and development ), despite pressure on income, to ensure it has enough products to secure future growth.

July 28, 2017:  


Shares of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories extended losses from Thursday, falling as much as 6.6 per cent to their lowest since May 30. The stock was the top percentage loser on the NSE index. 

Dr Reddy's Labs' Q1 net profit more than halved due to regulatory hurdles, pricing pressures in the United States, and the new tax structure. 

“We see earnings growth slowing down in FY18 before recovering in FY19 and FY20,” Morgan Stanley analysts said. 

Slowdown will come from higher competition in the US, lack of new product approvals, and higher costs, they added.

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]
Key people[edit]
As of 31 March 2014 15 board members and senior executives included.[22]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

As of 31 March 2014 15 board members and senior executives included.[22]

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and a very warm welcome to the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited Q4 FY '17 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I now hand the conference over to Mr. Saunak Savla. Thank you, and over to you, sir.
Saunak Savla
Yes, hi. A very good morning, and good evening to all of you, and thank you for joining us today for the Dr. Reddy's earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and the full year ended 31st March 2017. Earlier during the day, we have released our results, and the same are also posted on our website. We are conducting the slides as part of this call, and the transcript shall be available on our website soon.
Just a reminder that the discussion and analysis on this call will be based on the IFRS consolidated financial statements.
To discuss the business performance and outlook, we have the leadership team of Dr. Reddy's comprising Mr. Saumen Chakraborty, our CFO; Abhijit Mukherjee, our COO; and Mr. Anil Namboodiripad, who is the Head of our Proprietary Products business and the Investor Relations team. Please note that today's call is a copyrighted material of Dr. Reddy's, and it cannot be rebroadcasted or attributed in press or media outlets without the company's expressed written consent.
Before we proceed on to the call, I would like to remind everyone that the safe harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and the webcast. After the end of the call, if you have any additional clarifications, please feel free to get in touch with the Investor Relations team.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Saumen Chakraborty, our CFO.
Saumen Chakraborty
Thank you, Saunak. Greetings to everyone. Let me begin with the financial highlights. For this section, all the amounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the convenient translation rate of 64.85, which is the rate as of 31st March 2017.
Consolidated revenues for the year are at INR14,081 crores or $2.17 billion and declined by 9% year on year. Consolidated revenue for the quarter are INR3,554 crores or $548 million and declined 5% year on year and 4% sequentially. This is broadly in line with what we had alluded in our last earnings conference call. This decline is primarily on account of continuing price increases, no new significant product launch in the quarter together with supply constraints impacting our North America Generics business.
On the other side, the branded generics market performed better, especially the Russian operations, which had the benefit of strong ruble and stable economic outlook. Revenues from our Global Generics segment are $449 million and PSAI segments are $83 million. Consolidated gross profit margin for the quarter is 51.2%. Gross margin for Global Generics and PSAI were at 58.4% and 10%, respectively. Relative to the previous quarter, this is a sharp decline.
There are a few important figures during the quarter, bringing down the gross margin by approximately 400 basis point. These are: A, impairment charge recorded at our antibiotics manufacturing facility at Bristol; B, incremental provision of inventory buildup in anticipation of new product launch that failed to materialize, for example, sumatriptan 505(b)(2); C, the failure to supply penalties incurred due to supply disruption, for example, eszopiclone; D, unprecedented level of price erosion; and E, higher levels of repair and some maintenance charges incurred in order to renew some of the manufacturing facilities.

Moving on SG&A spend, including amortization for the quarter, is $169 million, a decrease of 6% year-on-year. After normalization of the Venezuela base effect, it's approximately at the same level of debt of quarter four of FY '16. So overall, we continue to explore revenues to optimize SG&A spend.
R&D expense for the quarter were at $71 million, representing 12.9% revenues and is in line with management estimates. It is 13.9% for the full year. EBITDA for the quarter stands at $97 million, which is around 18% of revenue. The lower revenues and gross margins primarily impacted EBITDA margin.
During the quarter, we generated around $150 million worth of cash flows from operations. Our net debt-to-equity ratio has marginally improved to 0.25 as on 31st March 2017. The effective tax rate is around 18% for the year and 2% for the quarter. The lower tax rate for the quarter is primarily due to resolution of certain tax matters pertaining to prior years. However, we anticipate the effective tax rate for FY '18 to be in the range of 23% to 25%.
Key balance sheet highlights are as follows: Our operating working capital decreased by $72 million during the quarter. We will continually focus on optimizing the working capital cycle. The capital expenditure for the quarter was at $36 million, and for the full year, it was $179 million. Foreign currency cash flow ranges for the next 12 months in the form of derivatives per U.S. dollar are approximately $235 million, largely hedged around the range of INR 66.78 to INR 69.23 to the dollar.
In addition, we have balance sheet areas of around $273.5 million. We also have foreign currency cash flow hedges of RUB 150 million at the rate of INR 1.137 to the ruble, maturing over next three months.
With these, I now request Abhijit to take us through the key business highlights.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Thanks, Saumen. Greetings to everybody, and I extend a warm welcome to you on this earnings conference call. As you will recall, in the last earnings conference call, we had alluded to a softer fourth quarter and developed a largely -- in line with our expectations.
Let me take you through some of the business highlights for each of our key markets. Please note that in this section, all references to numbers are in respective local currencies. Our North America Generic revenues for this quarter are $228 million. We closed the year at $956 million. During the year, we witnessed increased competitive intensity in a few of our high value assets. Normalizing for that, the base business has held up reasonably well in line with our expectations. The approval for high value launches continue to remain a challenge during the fiscal. The time lines for review of complex products and subsequent approvals from the agency have been getting better. We continue to work with the agency and remain optimistic about the eventual approvals. Our new launches calendar for the coming fiscal looks healthy and we expect [10 plus] launches in the current -- in the next 12 months. The current quarter also witnessed initiation of monetization of the Teva deal through our commercialization of G Vytorin, the first product from the transaction. These are limited to their market, and we expect -- we're excited about this opportunity. During the quarter, we have filed 13 ANDAs, taking the total to 26 filings in the fiscal year. This is indicative of our continuing focus on investing for long term growth and R&D productivity.
Continuing on pure generics. Our Europe business is fairly stable now and well poised to deliver profitable growth on the back of new product launches and traction in new markets. Our emerging markets business is on track of gradual recovery. Russia business closed the year with 8% constant currency growth and 26% for the quarter. This is broadly in line with our expectations. We continue to focus on improving productivity and augmenting the pipeline. During the quarter, the much awaited national tender of rituximab was announced, and we secured shares, and we have commenced supplies in the current quarter. As such the performance over the other markets was in line with our expectations. We're on track to expand our geographic presence through leverage -- of our institution business portfolio and biosimilars. Commercialization of biosimilars across emerging markets has now started gaining meaningful traction. We remain optimistic of building this momentum further. India business revenues are INR571 crores and grew by 8% Y-o-Y. We closed the year at INR2,313 crores and grew by 9%. Normalized for NLEM impact, the results are in line with our expectations. We continue to focus on productivity enhancements and portfolio augmentation.

PSAI business posted revenues of $80 million. The business is gaining traction in emerging markets with healthy margins. Our efforts are directed towards building a healthy order book. CPS business has done well this quarter. On Proprietary Products, we continue to grow the business, and we are witnessing improving trends for Zembrace and Sernivo. As of date, we have two pending NDAs with the agency, and one NDA recently approved that is the doxycycline in hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Further, during the quarter, we have settled the ongoing litigation on doxycycline, that is Zenavod with Galderma. Consequent to the settlement and our licensing arrangement, we received an upfront amount, and there are annual royalty performance [indiscernible].
That concludes my part. Thank you all and I would like to now open the floor for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you very much [Operator Instructions]. We'll take the first question from the line of Neha Manpuria from J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Neha Manpuria
So first, on the gross margins. You mentioned quite a few sort of one offs in the quarter. Could you give us anything -- I mean, some of this could be recurring, but in terms of impairment of the Bristol facility and provision for new -- how much of that -- the impact in the quarter's one off? Or is this likely to be recurring for a few quarters?
Saumen Chakraborty
The impairment facility doesn't recur. So we were earlier carrying a value of almost $12 million for the Bristol facility. Now after this impairment, the value is around $6 million. So this is, of course, done with all anticipated future earnings. That this is only an antibiotics facility. So there have been some specific -- API supply problems also were there. So we are not getting much business out of that facility. So as for the impairment trigger, we have to take this impairment. This is really -- whenever there are such trigger for recipe, but normally, we don't expect that. In the -- what I talked about the material inventory write off provision that happened, several times it happened. But this time, the incremental one is much higher because we built up in anticipation of launch, which has not happened. So we had to take the entire write off during the quarter.
Neha Manpuria
How much would this be, sir, roughly?
Saumen Chakraborty
I will get back to you the numbers later.
Neha Manpuria
No worries, sir. And, sir, on the Isotretinoin supply that could disrupt this, by when do we expect this to normalize? Would this take a couple of more quarters?
Saumen Chakraborty
We are expecting approval from...
Abhijit Mukherjee
We have applied for a few years. As and when that gets approved, wouldn't put a date exactly, but I think your question was more on FTS incurred. I think that tapers down as it happens only after discontinuation. So that is also a one off this quarter.
Neha Manpuria
Okay, got it. And my last question was on the launch. So If I remember correctly, last quarter, you'd indicated about 15 plus launches in FY '18, and we're now talking about 10 plus launches. Is this because we're expecting some delays due to the inspections that have happened recently?
Anil Namboodiripad
This is well -- indicative. It's -- at the beginning of the year, currently, your guess is as good as mine. In April, we have been able to do 2, G Vytorin and Suboxone generic. So -- okay, let's take it 10 to 15, somewhere in between.
Saumen Chakraborty
We don't have the right answer. We don't know what to say, either.
Operator
We'll take the next question from the line of Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.
Prakash Agarwal
Just trying to understand the filing, run rate has been pretty significant despite Duvvada, Bachupally and other all the facilities having some observations and earlier ones still stuck up. So where are these filings? From which facilities are these filings happening?

Anil Namboodiripad
Mixed all over. So this is from some from partners, some internal, distributed amounts, various locations, we have two other solid locations, a topical location, and then you have ingestible location and several partners as well.
Prakash Agarwal
So, most facilities are under some U.S. FDA still having some FDA issues. So we continue to file. So what I'm trying to understand is we do expect -- do not expect any escalation in Duvvada, Bachupally and all.
Anil Namboodiripad
Well, I mean, I won't when you say most facilities are impacted there first of all, the API facilities mostly have gone through world audits, all three of them. Duvvada is the only one where we had to sort of -- that observations will have to sort of -- we responded well, and let's see how that sort of -- but that doesn't prevent us from filing. It's our judgment, but we continue to file, yes. We also filed some ingestibles from partners well. As far as Bachupally is concerned, we mentioned that in our view, these are procedural, and we'll sort of deal with this with the necessary response and whatever interventions.
Prakash Agarwal
Okay. And Srikakulam, is there any update, sir?
Abhijit Mukherjee
I use probably, it's in public domain the observations, right? Only two of them are very relatively easy to answer observations, and we had three from the Miryalaguda two API sites which were impacted and the third API site had zero observation. Yes, I mean, update from Miryalaguda, we have just got a CB 30 approval, which was earlier stuck. So that's, in a way, I will take it as a positive.
Prakash Agarwal
No, no, sir Srikakulam.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes, as I've mentioned, Srikakulam an audit happened. After this, there's no update, meaning, there'll be no -- we respond, and then we will know the subsequent whenever files come up for approval, we'll know. I mean, we don't expect.
Prakash Agarwal
From our side, do we expect resolution within this financial year, sir?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Depends on what you're talking about resolution. Because in our view, if we start getting approval in any form, that's a resolution.
Prakash Agarwal
That's right, yes.
Abhijit Mukherjee
So one Miryalaguda, as I've said, we have got one earlier, CB 30, they just got approval. So that audit happened a little earlier, a little maybe...
Saumen Chakraborty
Two months ago.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Or not even two. I think it's sort of a month before it [indiscernible].
Saumen Chakraborty
Two months ago.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Oh, two months, whatever. So that's the only data point we have.
Prakash Agarwal
Okay. And lastly, sir on the amortization. Just trying to understand Vytorin was one of the products that we got from Teva's drug Actavis. So the amortization would start for these assets that we acquired and the time lines that we are looking for the other two big ones?
Saumen Chakraborty
Yes. I don't know when we are commercializing, that will start. The specific yes, amortization that will happen, but I don't know when we'll commercialize. I'm not understanding your specific concern there. What are you trying to ask?
Prakash Agarwal
No, I'm just trying to understand that the assets that we purchase for $350 million, how are we actually amortizing the entire piece since the first product has already started?
Saumen Chakraborty
There is a PPA. There is a purchase price allocation which is there, which has been already disclosed. So based on that, the amortizations will happen; the products -- specific product, whenever it is getting commercialized.
Prakash Agarwal
And the larger piece happens only when the large two products get amortized -- gets approved and launched?
Saumen Chakraborty
Yes. You're absolutely right.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Anubhav Aggarwal from Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Anubhav Aggarwal
One question on [indiscernible] Vytorin. When do you expect the next round of competition in this product? And currently, after the launch, what market share Dr. Reddy's have gotten?
Abhijit Mukherjee 
So very fair market share for three players, currently. Next round, certainly, I don't know, so I can't comment. The only I think -- the public domain -- from Mylan's con call is -- they are impacted because of the market is in public domain. Beyond that, I have no idea.
Anubhav Aggarwal
So that -- I'm aware of Mylan. That's exactly what I was asking beyond this, but do you expect this to be as good a product for fiscal '18 and as good a product fiscal '19 as well based on your intelligence right now?
Abhijit Mukherjee
How can you predict? You wouldn't be knowing how, where, who's with enterprise with FDA and all that stuff. So far, so good. So let's continue to sell.
Anubhav Aggarwal
And on the PSAI, the margins are very weak this quarter. What happened there? Because all the gross margins impacted Saumen has talked about were largely on the Global Generics side. What happened on the PSAI side?
Saumen Chakraborty
The CTO, [indiscernible] we supply both to the external API as well as to our internal per [indiscernible] consumption. So the -- in turnover rate, how does it get allocated. So there is real considerable moment of which happened, and that is a primary reason for the impact on the PSAI going forward. And I must -- who has been -- we have spent much higher level of repair and maintenance than normally we spend, and that we have done specifically to renew some of the city or manufacturing facilities because compared to the [indiscernible], these CTOs were our earlier plans. So we spent quite a bit on [indiscernible].
Anubhav Aggarwal
And can you also, sir, help with implied cost? Your implied cost is down like 18% in the March quarter versus your December '16 quarter. That seems such a sharp decline. There seems to be some one-offs there.
Saumen Chakraborty
So as a company, we always believed in terms of putting much higher stake for our senior management, top management in terms of variable pay, LTI and various other things, which we put at stake. So if there have been higher profit then there would have been a higher kind of pay -- variable pay. To the extent it is not there, we suffered. So individually, we suffer, but company in terms of variable cost.
Anubhav Aggarwal
But this is a phenomenon which happens in the fourth quarter every year? Or will this...
Saumen Chakraborty
It was triggered. No, it will all depends on the trigger. If suppose, we would have got the final factor on 505(b)(2), the result would have been different for us.
Anubhav Aggarwal
But this seems a very sharp decline, 18% sequentially.
Saumen Chakraborty
So maybe we can discuss offline later.
Anil Namboodiripad
So essentially, yes, during the year, you count and then you take cost at the end of the year and on the variable pay. So accordingly, you -- yes, so to that extent, it has some bit of fourth quarter impact.
Anubhav Aggarwal
Okay. Just one more clarity, not on discussion but on Duvvada and the Bachupally facility. In your corrective action plan, just some clarity if you can provide. What time do you plan to finish the remediation's from your side at least on both those plants? 
Abhijit Mukherjee
No, I -- there is -- remediation as such we have mentioned last year, we had spent whatever had to be spent in terms of remediation. Now there's some observations have come in. These are more large -- to a large extent, to do with operator training, certain operations on areas which need sort of special intervention, gross and net, then which will be largely internal. I'm not sure there is a cost, there are efforts, but I think -- I don't think that there's a significant cost involved at this stage. And Bachupally, as I mentioned is our -- most procedural and less so in terms of cost to be vetted.

Anubhav Aggarwal
Sir, I was not asking much on the cost...
Operator
Anubhav, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I would request you to come back in queue for any follow up questions. [Operator Instructions] We have the next question from the line of Surya Patra from PhillipCapital. Please go ahead.
Surya Patra
Sir, just a clarification about all these remuneration activities or resolution that we are anticipating for all these three facility, which is -- which are currently under issue? So if the resolution to happen then, it will happen at a time for all the three facility? Or it can happen separately also?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Look, specifically, we can't comment. We can only give you the data point, which I just repeated, that we had the Miryalaguda, we had Srikakulam and Duvvada. So Miryalaguda, the first one to get audited, and I've -- we got a [CB 30], which is earlier stock because of GNP and now we just got, just a few days back the approval for that. So that's the only data point that we have. Beyond that, we wouldn't [Indiscernible].
Surya Patra
Okay. Since it is covered under one issue, so it might not be -- not necessarily a realization has to happen at a time for all? That is all?
Abhijit Mukherjee
There is a data point. And your interpretation is yours.
Surya Patra
Yes, okay. And just one more quick query, sir, about the U.S. pricing scenario for the base business, how is it? And do you really feel that okay, there's a kind of forced stabilization in the pricing scenario there? And what will be the base business price erosion, if you can say, for your portfolio?
Abhijit Mukherjee
This year has been, as Saumen mentioned, has been somewhat bad. I guess, rather [Indiscernible] invisible when you don't have launches. Overall, and the impact-wise. But overall, this year has been particularly bad. But these things will vary quarter to quarter, company to company. At average, annualized, we still feel that we'll be in the range of high single digit, very low double digit type of a thing but can vary from quarter to quarter. Yes, we have taken most of our erosions here this year. Not able to see very large one coming through immediately, but you'll never know.
Surya Patra
My point was that post this election phase in the U.S. and post the major of the controlled channel consolidation happening in the recent past, so are we still seeing at this current moment some issue of a pricing, price correction or increased competition in the [indiscernible]?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Elections or anything, this is all about the consolidation of the content which have happened, and we spoke about it. I mean, the channel got consolidated. The impacts are showing now. A price increase or price adjustments are not there at all. So overall, I think all that has -- I don't think dynamics specifically have changed.
Operator
We'll take the next question from the line of Sameer Baisiwala from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sameer Baisiwala
Abhijit, is it possible for you to give a broad color for fiscal '18 on the top line and on the EBITDA margin?
Abhijit Mukherjee
No, I mean...
Saumen Chakraborty
We do not give financial guidance, Sameer. You are aware of that.
Sameer Baisiwala
Yes, fair enough. Not looking for guidance. I think just general color. Is it going to be...
Abhijit Mukherjee
So with general color, I don't know what you mean by general color. But overall, I told you 10-plus launches in U.S., and it's well known that it depends on which launches and what launches one, we just sets one. And it's laid out well. Let's see how the rest of it plays out. U.S. will continue to be dominant and most unpredictable in many ways because, depending on launches, depending on approvals, depending on resolution, et cetera, and all those things, we'll be -- most of the other markets, I think we expect clearly northward sort of results. Emerging markets, the currencies have stabilized. We have put in significant effort in increasing footprint. Biologics, more and more traction. So expect very healthy growth there. India, well known, maybe 10%, 12% range type of a thing. Europe is broadly in control. We'll grow this year. It has been flattish last year to this year, but of this current year, we grow significantly but again, small pipe. PSAI also we'd expect to do certainly better, much better than the last financial year. But a lot would still depend on how [indiscernible] plays out.

Sameer Baisiwala
Yes, that's very helpful. I mean, the second question on the 10 to 15 launches that you expect, how many are going to be successful given specifically also on the thoughts on Copaxone and NuvaRing?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Okay. I'll go to the second one. First one, I wouldn't know. I wouldn't be able to answer how many would be sort of meaningful. But yes, Copaxone, as we've mentioned, we sent in our 20 mg response. The DNFS once we had spent in quite a few months back, I think December probably or something of the sort. So we have received a TAD, of which is, give or take, six months from now. So we'll wait for -- hopefully, I ask, in between and maybe a CR, I don't know. But as we mentioned, I still sort of feel that we have done a reasonably thorough job, and let's see how that plays out. NuvaRing, I think on the IP side, I think it's becoming less-and-less critical because in any case, it's somewhat clear and then anyway, that specific of IP gets over by -- until next year. Meanwhile now, addresses how we -- so that -- there's a CR, which are planning to respond in what, about few weeks from now. And then let's see how that sort of progresses.
Operator
Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Vishal Manchanda from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.
Vishal Manchanda
So in the initial commentary you had said on a licensing of Zenavod. So could you -- I couldn't hear that clearly. So if you could give more color on that?
Saumen Chakraborty
Could you repeat the question again? Licensing of?
Vishal Manchanda
Zenavod -- it has been filed from Promius Pharma.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Zenavod.
Saumen Chakraborty
Okay. So what is the specific question again? What do you want to know?
Vishal Manchanda
Is there a settlement that you have entered into?
Saumen Chakraborty
Yes, there is a settlement that we entered. You're talking about the income recognition from the Galderma deal?
Vishal Manchanda
Yes. And when is the launch scheduled and..?
Saumen Chakraborty
Can you -- Anil, can you take this?
Anil Namboodiripad
Yes, I'll take the second part.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes, and Saumen, you can talk about the income recognized. So this was a settlement followed by a licensing. And that was done with Galderma. So the launch is upon Galderma. And the intent they have expressed is to launch it at the earliest possible. We do not have a specific date.
Saumen Chakraborty
So in terms of -- we have received some upfront cash settlement, but in terms of the revenue recognition, we follow strictly their accounting standard, and accordingly, a part has been taken to future income.
Vishal Manchanda
And additionally -- one more. Could you like also talk about the value of the Rituxan tender you would have received for Russian market?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Well, in the market, as you know there's a lot, okay? And because it's been somewhat aggressive. It's now, in a way, there are Russian player there and us. So yes, I mean, I'll not -- let's not talk about this tender. But overall, I think for the year, high double-digit million dollars, that's it.
Anil Namboodiripad
In case that we -- there's one more tender, in case I'm assuming that we have share there as well. So we got it.
Vishal Manchanda
And if you could guide on how many emerging market approvals should we look at this year for your biosimilar portfolio?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Specifically, we wouldn't comment on this, but certainly, one more reasonably large country, yes. Two more smaller ones. But these things depend on how these -- the regulatory part there proceeds. But these are certainly not as big as Russia. But there will be organic growth also in this product.
Operator
We'll take the next question from the line of Nitin Agarwal from IDFC Securities.
Nitin Agarwal
Now on the emerging markets, you refer to the fact that you put in significant...

Saumen Chakraborty
One moment. Let me clarify when I mentioned about the last question on the double digit, which is I'm probably saying within 15 to 20, in that range.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes, go ahead.
Nitin Agarwal
So the emerging markets, you mentioned about some significant effort being put in for improving footprint. I mean, can you throw some light on that? Are we referring to the efforts in existing markets? Or are you talking about creating some -- opening up some new markets for the -- on the emerging markets side?
Saumen Chakraborty
Both are done. There are certain markets where we are present. So that is done internally or at certain markets where we are not present, we're alliance partner. So and biosimilar opportunities that we disclose [Indiscernible].
Nitin Agarwal
So the emerging market story is now largely -- is being driven through the biosimilar route in terms of any expanding emerging market presence that sees our process?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Well, that's one major growth driver. The second is we are building an institution business in various countries. We have opened up in Brazil and Colombia, and we -- Colombia already, we had launched few products last year. This year, we'll see more and more launches and traction and growth on that. Brazil won is the interesting for us. We are getting the institution business with the first launches just starting as we speak. And in the year, probably three to five launches this year. And those would be the major ones. And then a few North American markets, few Asian markets through partnership, etcetera. So overall, we're trying to build an institution business with global footprint and so largely led by oncology products.
Nitin Agarwal
And these will be pretty much the products that you already commercialized in the U.S. or Europe, I guess.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Largely [Indiscernible] And that process will continue as we keep pricing, we will continue to leverage and see how we can -- and the only thing is that several markets are building their footprint, and it's important that we build the footprint so that we are able to get to the institutions ourselves.
Nitin Agarwal
And lastly, of the 10 to 15 products that you talked about launching that are currently in the U.S., are any of them kind of contingent on the resolutions on the Houston facilities?
Abhijit Mukherjee
We wouldn't be providing all the details and subsequent questions from where and what. So I think let's just leave it at that. Let's take 10 plus, and I was supposed to commit 10 to 15. So wherever you want to sort of take that, Nitin. So let's just leave it at that.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Aishwarya Agarwal from Reliance Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.
Aishwarya Agarwal
Can you please help us with this varied key areas repeat observations? So I just want to understand, how serious this repeat observations are, and I mean, what you expect from it? I mean, will we be able to overcome with whatever processes you're supposed to do? Or will it get escalated?
Abhijit Mukherjee
So I think well, the observations are in public domain right now. And you'll have to make -- if I take your call by consulting people. But we'll give you some broad view that currently, the interpretation by the agency on repeat is not specific, but let's say, something is called out and it falls in that category and later in that category, you have observation, which is maybe a different observation. But it still said it's considered as a repeat observation. I mean, this is again, with the changing trend on that setting we're seeing this happening repeatedly. For Duvvada, which is probably, as I had mentioned, well, we had spending a lot [indiscernible] large comprehensive response. The first repeat observation is on the investigation quality. Now every quarter, we have -- and that particular observation is probably half of the whole observation we have in terms of the number of [indiscernible].

And in investigation quality, there will -- every quarter, we have -- or not probably there are various incidents we continue to investigate and continue to make report. So naturally, there is scope for improvement, and we are putting all efforts. But there is indeed, as a broad category, it can come up even in the future. I mean, in similar areas, and not to say that we're putting all our efforts. We're trying to make it as broad umbrella effort to sort of remediate in our facilities. But as a whole category, sometimes this may come up.
Aishwarya Agarwal
Hello?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes?
Aishwarya Agarwal
Yes, yes, okay. Sir, my next question is have you filed a Copaxone formulation?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes. I just mentioned that we have committed, and it was filed, and we've got a TAD. The TAD is, give or take, six months from now.
Operator
We'll take the next question from the line of Manoj Garg from Bank of America.
Manoj Garg
I would like, you already read a couple of time in this call regarding your [EM] strategies, both on the biosimilar side as well as on the injector business. I just want to have a broader sense, that three to five years down the line, how big this opportunity could be for us, from both the segments in the emerging market?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Fairly significant. So I wouldn't put a figure to it but it's one of the core strategic thrust areas, we will put in first money -- resources behind this. And we're doing it, building that systematically, yes, three to five years. The question is good and valid question. I think fairly significant. Beyond that, I wouldn't go any further.
Manoj Garg
And if we can get some sense in terms of like the oral side of the opportunity for rituximab, within those emerging market, where either you have filed or you are waiting for the approval. How significant that could be if you want to put some numbers out there?
Saumen Chakraborty
Finally, [indiscernible] not to characterize to given any kind of financial guidance which is against our policy. But to give the color and the reports which we are putting in to build in our future business growth.
Manoj Garg
Sure. And this question is for Anil. Like if you look for our proprietary business, I think last year, we had an EBITDA loss of around $80 million, $90 million. So given the kind of ramp up, which we are seeing plus more approvals, which we are anticipating over the next few years, how do you see the P&L of your pro business moving maybe two, three years down the line?
Anil Namboodiripad
Yes. So right now, we have a fairly rich pipeline of assets in late-stage clinical development, many of them are high-value assets. With the launch of these assets and the number of NDAs that we expect to file over the next few years, we anticipate to start seeing positive revenues within the next three to four years.
Manoj Garg
And in terms of getting the breakeven for this business, like from $80 million to $85 million kind of EBITDA loss, when do you see the breakeven?
Saumen Chakraborty
You wanted to mean the positive cash flow. Revenue remains positive today.
Abhijit Mukherjee
It is a positive cash flow.
Anil Namboodiripad
So that's what I meant, that we will start seeing positive cash flows over the next three to four years.
Manoj Garg
And just on India, Abhijit, you like, you spoke about the 9% to 10% annual growth for the domestic market. Does it mean that probably we will be largely in line with the market growth or because I think in the past you alluded that we have done a lot of cost correction in the domestic market, and going forward, we expect probably -- even to accelerate our domestic growth higher than the industry growth. So is it because of GST, you're a little conservative? Or like you feel that they're maybe some two, three is kind of things that growth will be in the range of 9% to 10%?

Abhijit Mukherjee
You're right. Actually, there's so much one is hearing, reading, seeing these days and uncertainties are all around GST and various other things. So I'm just putting out our figures because -- I mean, look, I won't go beyond that at the moment. But yes, I mean, they could be a little bit higher if everything goes well.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Abhishek Sharma from India Infoline. Please go ahead.
Abhishek Sharma
Sir, did I hear you correctly, you said you received the CRL [indiscernible]?
Abhijit Mukherjee
When we received or when we...?
Saumen Chakraborty
Have we received?
Abhijit Mukherjee
We are actually responding, in fact, in a couple of weeks, within a couple of weeks. Yes, we are -- we received, and we are responding to the complete response letter in a -- within a couple of weeks, yes.
Abhishek Sharma
And what is the nature of observation, sir? Does it relate to manufacturing or...?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Like normal CRL, there are quite -- these are job device combinations. So there are questions on from all sections, and we had to do a lot of work, and we are responding. And let's see -- there could be a few more questions. But let's see how that goes.
Abhishek Sharma
As of the other question is on Aloxi. Is there any further visibility on when you would be able to launch it now or...?
Abhijit Mukherjee
So you'd probably have seen there are some interesting developments on the litigation side, driven by another company. And we'll be watching this closely on -- this is not the 505(b)(2), but on the 505 G side. Let's see how that unfolds. So as far as the (b)(2) is concerned, we have appealed. But it all depends on, as I said, on the other side, on how that unfolds. So what's next? Give or take, let's say, 60 to 80 days.
Abhishek Sharma
Your approach would remain 505(b)(2), right? And -- but all the -- yes?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes, we have both options. Yes.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Kartik Mehta from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kartik Mehta
Yes, just on your inspection which happened in Duvvada. Could you quantify if all the products which are manufactured from there have been effectively transferred to some other side in the event that we receive any occular there?
Abhijit Mukherjee
You're talking of the existing commercialized product?
Kartik Mehta
Yes.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes, the -- I think we mentioned the $2 million ingestibles have a core side and a partner side as well. But yes, so that probably answers and there is one more order in solid, which we don't have a partner there. But I mean, we stay positive about the -- I really sincerely hope that it doesn't go this -- the direction you said -- you mentioned.
Kartik Mehta
Yes. So again, just to maybe stick on the re-inspection. In your consolidation with your -- with your advisers, do you feel that as per the global cap, all three plants would -- the receive in the IR are the same demeanor? You just mentioned about [CD30]. But then, in your view, can the other two plants remain on the warning letter and any one of the other be under...
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes. So you've seen the observation is in public domain, right? And you can make your interpretation on this. And the data point which we gave is from one plant, we have all received that [CB 30]. So based on that, you sort of have your interpretation. And you're probably, I'm sure, seeing the observations from those three plants, right?
Kartik Mehta
Yes, sir. The reason I asked is because I'm not able to make an observation because all the three plants were given 1 warning letter which is why it was addressed to you.
Abhijit Mukherjee
So that I don't -- you see that's why I can't answer the question in specifics but I can only give you a data point. I can give you a data point and a data point is from one side you've got a [CB 30] approval, which was a first one of it. And let's see how the rest of it unfolds.

Kartik Mehta
And the second one is, is that change in expectations due to the recent Claros 1 web cycle?
Saumen Chakraborty
What is it? Can you repeat?
Kartik Mehta
Which is the competition in the U.S. intensifying?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes. Yes, okay. So you're talking -- the most recent consolidation you're talking about, right?
Kartik Mehta
That's right.
Abhijit Mukherjee
So I think the -- this is not new anymore for anyone. So I think we'll deal with the way we dealt with the previous one. So as I said, that I think -- whatever erosion the market has seen in that range will continue. And we will deal with that documentation the way we have dealt it in the past.
Operator
We have the next question from the line of Saion Mukherjee from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
Saion Mukherjee
So one question on the proprietary product side. If you can, you noticed anyone at Zembrace, how are they doing and, what kind of -- you guided for $30 million to $50 million earlier as peak potential, when do you see that coming through for these products? And if you can update us on the filings that are on the prop side that you've done this year. How many are pending approval? And what kind of launch calendar that you're looking for FY '18 and '19?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Sure. So let me start with how the business is doing. Both Zembrace and Sernivo have significantly picked up since the last time we spoke, which was the last quarter. With Zembrace, prescriptions in Q4 increased by roughly around 33% over Q3, reaching more than 500 prescriptions per week by the end of FY '17, and that's what we were targeting, and we are on target, serving as a launch pad for FY '18. Number of prescribers have grown nearly 50%, which is all good indicators of how the product is being taken by the market.
Similarly, on Sernivo, we have more than 850 prescriptions per week, which is quite healthy. And that's how we ended FY '17 and a 40% volume increase over Q3's highest week. So these are some indicators for you to explain that these two products are now positioned for further growth through FY '18. The base business has also been doing steadily. So your question was around the peak sales and when we will get there. So as I had mentioned to you, in FY '17, we were facing, there was some delay in terms of getting managed care off insurance coverage. As of now, we have 75% coverage with insurance plans. There is still room to grow, but we believe that that will happen. Peak sales, we expect in the next three years or so for both products. The other part of your question was around key launches. So we have two pending NDAs for FY '18. One of them is Xeglyze, which is contingent upon clearance of one of our facilities and the other is a steroid product for dermatology-- it's a topical product for dermatology and that is expected to be approved the PDUFA date is later in the year. And there are several other NDAs that we expect in FY '19. So we are not commenting on it at this time.
Saion Mukherjee
Sir, can you throw some light on the XenoPort asset, I mean, how that is progressing in any time line that you have visibility on in terms of filing?
Saumen Chakraborty
So this will be further off in terms of the time lines from the immediate listing. This has to go through its development. So maybe we can take that at a later stage.
Operator
Due to time constraints, we will take the last question from the line of Rahul Sharma from KARVY Stock Broking.
Rahul Sharma
Just wondered, the clarity on what could be the sustainable gross margins going ahead for the company?
Saumen Chakraborty
Again, you are speaking of financial guidance. So as last time, also I said, normally, the way we manage our business it's supposed to have not plus 50% of the gross margins but for the last couple of years, 55% is the right -- was there, maybe in few quarters, we got even higher. But this quarter has been specifically lower for the reasons I have explained. So it could be within this range, take a few hundred basis points, plus or minus the 55%, could be a normal effect.

Rahul Sharma
Plus or minus 55% is in hundred [indiscernible] there.
Saumen Chakraborty
It could be 100, 200, it depends on -- you cannot be so accurate and -- I am just stating, we refrain from giving any financial guidance for the basis there could be a lot of uncertainties. You cannot be absolutely certain about the pricing conditions, the contracts that we put and all the flow. So all these things affects -- in terms of your margin, but yes, normal expectations, if you wanted to model some kind of a financial modeling. I am saying is here and there, a few hundred basis points, but 55 could be our normal.
Rahul Sharma
If you would add up all those one-offs which were there, then what could be a gross margin for the quarter?
Saumen Chakraborty
I said this would have -- I mean, this has declined by 400 basis points. So if we had to add 51.2 plus 400 basis point, it would have been around 55 point something.
Rahul Sharma
And another thing was, how has been the -- a price erosion in the existing portfolio on Y-o-Y basis and on Q-on-Q? In the U.S. markets?
Saumen Chakraborty
So we had already told you that this year, particularly in FY '17, it has been tedious. But it will vary also from company-to-company depending on portfolio launches and everything. But we have seen FY '17 over FY '16 is a bit unprecedented because we have never seen earlier on gross level going beyond the high single-digits for this year, it has been in the double digits. And this quarter specifically, it's been higher. But going forward, the expectation is that it may not be that level of erosion in the [indiscernible]
Operator
Thank you very much. Due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Saunak Savla for closing comments.
Saunak Savla

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]




Biopharma Finished Dosage Unit III in Hyderabad






Biopharma Finished Dosage Unit I in Hyderabad


Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

As of 31 March 2014 15 board members and senior executives included.[22]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

DR. Reddys Lab (NYSE:RDY)Intraday Stock Chart
Today : Friday 28 July 2017



      Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (BSE: 500124, NSE: DRREDDY, NYSE: RDY) and 
      CHD Bioscience Inc., a privately-held biopharmaceutical company, today 
      announced a global licensing agreement for the clinical development and 
      commercialization of Dr. Reddy’s Phase III clinical trial candidate, 
      DFA-02. It is intended to be used for the prevention of surgical site 
      infections, following non-emergency, elective colorectal surgery. Phase 
      II studies for DFA-02 have been successfully completed, and the product 
      will be transitioning to pivotal Phase III registration studies.
    

      Under the terms of the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s would receive equity in 
      CHD valued at $30 million upon an IPO of CHD or a minimum of $30 million 
      in cash within 18 months of execution of the agreement. Dr. Reddy’s will 
      also receive additional milestone payments of $40 million upon USFDA 
      approval. In addition, CHD will pay Dr. Reddy’s double-digit royalties 
      on sales and commercial milestones.
    

      Commenting on the signing of the agreement, Anil Namboodiripad, Ph.D., 
      Senior Vice President, Proprietary Products, and President, Promius 
      Pharma, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dr. Reddy’s, said, “We are pleased 
      to announce our partnership with CHD Bioscience. We feel that the needs 
      of patients undergoing surgery will be well served by CHD, given their 
      strong focus on offering targeted solutions for surgical site 
      infections. DFA-02 has demonstrated promising results in clinical 
      studies, and we are excited about the prospect of CHD undertaking 
      further development and commercialization of the asset.”
    

      “This transaction advances our strategy to become a world leader in the 
      targeted prevention and treatment of drug-resistant infections. Building 
      on our development work with VERIOX™ in orthopedics and wound 
      care, DFA-02 potentially extends our ability to help patients in the 
      surgical setting who may be at high risk of infections without exposing 
      the patient to large amounts of systemic antibiotics,” said Michael 
      Handley, director and chief executive officer of CHD Bioscience. “DFA-02 
      fits our strategy of targeting the site of the infection rather than the 
      whole patient, and we are pleased to be continuing the great work that 
      Dr. Reddy’s has started.”
    

About DFA-02


      DFA-02, Gentamicin and Vancomycin Sterile Gel for surgical wound 
      administration, is a novel bioresorbable extended release 
      phospholipid-based gel intended to be applied within the surgical 
      incision at the time of closure to potentially reduce the risk of 
      surgical site infection (SSI). The gentamicin component is intended to 
      provide coverage for Gram-negative organisms and the vancomycin 
      component is intended to provide coverage for Gram-positive organisms. 
      Further, the gel is intended to provide a high concentration of 
      gentamicin and vancomycin locally at the surgical site with limited 
      systemic exposure.
    

      In preclinical studies, DFA-02 has demonstrated promising properties. 
      Pharmacokinetics in these preclinical studies have demonstrated high 
      local tissue concentrations (greater than four times the minimum 
      inhibitory concentration [MIC] for sensitive organisms) and systemic 
      concentrations at or below recommended levels after use during closure 
      of surgical incisions. Preclinical models have also demonstrated 
      efficacy in reducing infection in surgical incisions as measured by 
      bacterial counts. No adverse histopathological findings or evidence of 
      interference in wound healing were observed.
    

      Clinically, two human studies have been completed in abdominal surgery. 
      No safety or tolerability concerns were observed and systemic gentamicin 
      and vancomycin levels were within acceptable limits. Further, on post 
      hoc analysis, DFA-02 demonstrated a statistically (p = 0.05) significant 
      reduction (60%) in surgical site infections in inflammatory bowel 
      disease patients receiving the treatment over patients in the control 
      arm receiving standard of care.

      NSE: DRREDDY, NYSE: RDY) is an integrated pharmaceutical company,

About CHD Bioscience: CHD Bioscience, Inc. is a Colorado and New 
      York-based biopharmaceutical company, creating a new paradigm of 
      antimicrobial therapy. Our approach is to provide localized targeted 
      antimicrobial delivery at higher concentrations than can be achieved 
      with intravenous or oral delivery and thus potentially increase the 
      efficacy of the therapy as well as increasing the safety. . 
      Specifically, we believe intravenous and oral delivery of antimicrobial 
      therapies should be the exception not the rule when treating infections. 
      The majority of infections are localized/confined infections that 
      systemic therapy has difficulty reaching at reasonable concentrations to 
      provide reliable efficacious outcomes. Furthermore, systemic therapy can 
      have undesirable side effects in terms of potentiation of 
      hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and elimination of the beneficial 
      microbiome that provide improved immunity and resistance against 
      opportunistic infections from bad microbes. CHD is developing a pipeline 
      of products that overcome the issues involved with systemic 
      antimicrobial therapy and establishing ourselves as the global leader in 
      this market. Our first products to market will use our patented VERIOX™ 
      chemistry that has demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy profiles 
      in pre-clinical testing. We plan to initially launch product in the 
      orthopedic and wound care markets using products that contain VERIOX™ 
      chemistry. For more information, visit http://www.chdbioscience.com/

  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration Silver Spring, MD  20993  Warning Letter Via UPS                                                                                  WL: 320-16-02 November 5, 2015Mr. Satish Reddy ChairmanDr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.8-2-337, Road No 3Banjara Hills, Hyderabad 500034Andhra Pradesh 530 046 India Dear Mr. Reddy: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected the following three Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in India: A.    November 17-21, 2014: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited CTO Unit VI, located at APIIC Industrial Estate, Pydibhimavarma (Village), Ranasthalam Mandai, Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh;B.    January 26-31, 2015: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited CTO Unit V, located at Peddadevulapally Village, Tripuraram, Mandal, Miryalguda Taluk, Nalgonda District, Telangana; andC.    February 26 to March 6, 2015: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., Unit-VII located at Plot No. P1 to P9, Phase III, Duvvada, VSEZ, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. At Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited CTO Units VI and V facilities, we identified significant deviations from current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).  At Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited Unit-VII facility, we found significant violations of CGMP regulations for finished pharmaceuticals, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 210 and 211.  These deviations and violations cause your APIs and finished drug products to be adulterated within the meaning of Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).  The methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to, or are not operated or administered in conformity with, CGMP.  We reviewed your firm’s responses of December 15, 2014, February 19, 2015, and March 27, 2015.  We note that they lack sufficient corrective actions. We received your additional correspondence of January 31, April 9, May 13, May 21, July 14, and September 14, 2015.  Our investigators observed specific deviations and violations during the inspection, including, but not limited to, the following.  A.    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited CTO Unit VI Facility (FEI: 3002949085) 1.    Failure to maintain complete data derived from all laboratory tests conducted to ensure compliance with established specifications and standards. Your laboratory records did not contain all raw data generated during each test for API batches manufactured at your firm. The investigator found that batch samples were routinely re-tested following failing or atypical results until acceptable results were obtained, and that failing or atypical results were not investigated or included in the official laboratory control records.  During the inspection, the presence of an uncontrolled “Custom QC laboratory” (CQC) was discovered by our inspection team. The existence of this laboratory was previously unknown to FDA. Your QC Associate Director acknowledged that the CQC laboratory was involved in CGMP analysis of APIs intended for export to the United States through 2012. This discovery was made one day before the end of the inspection, but during FDA’s brief evaluation of the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) electronic records generated by the CQC, our investigators found the following examples. a.    (b)(4) (raw material) batch #(b)(4)You performed assay/related substances by HPLC at (b)(4) on January 23, 2012.  The sample failed the specification limit for purity, with a result of (b)(4)% (specification: NLT (b)(4)%).  This failing result was not documented or reported. You repeated the analysis at (b)(4) on January 24, 2012, with a failing result of (b)(4)%.  Again, you did not document or report it.  On January 25, 2012, you conducted a third analysis at (b)(4)  Your laboratory’s “Record of Analysis” for this batch, which you used to support batch disposition decisions, contained only the passing results obtained during the third and final test. b.    (b)(4) batch #(b)(4) You conducted purity testing by HPLC at (b)(4) on January 27, 2012.  This sample failed the purity specification limit (NLT (b)(4)%) with a result of (b)(4)%, but you did not document, report or investigate the failure.  Your QC data package, which you used to support batch disposition decisions, showed passing results from (b)(4) on the same day but does not include the initial failing results. c.    (b)(4) U.S. DMF batch #(b)(4)The first sample analysis for related substances by HPLC was performed in duplicate at (b)(4) February 10, 2012. The second injection of this first sample contained an extra peak. Sample preparation information was not documented, and the test result with the extra peak was not reported.  Your QC records for this batch, which you used to support your Drug Master File for this product and to support batch disposition decisions, included results only from a later analysis that you conducted at (b)(4) on February 11, 2012.  d.    (b)(4) batch #(b)(4)The first sample analysis for assay/related substances by HPLC was performed at (b)(4) January 14, 2012.  The sample failed the specification limit for known and unknown impurities.  The second sample analysis, performed the same day at (b)(4), also failed the specification limits for known and unknown impurities.  A third test, performed at (b)(4), January 14, 2012, also failed the specification limits for known and unknown impurities. Only the third failure was reported in your QC data package, which you used to support batch disposition decisions.  Sample preparation information for the first two sequence runs was not documented.  In your December 15, 2014 response, you stated that tests were repeated because your analysts observed:significant drifts in the base linechromatograph peak shapes inconsistent with the usual peaksdelays between sample preparation and injection an injection of a sample before the previous sample was fully eluted from the column incorrect vial numbers entered into the auto injector  None of these explanations justify your failure to maintain complete records, nor do they support your practice of substituting repeat tests after failing results.  You acknowledged that your analysts failed to document and start investigating OOS results, as required by your SOP 01-045/03 “Handling of Incidents” and SOP 08-004/12 “Laboratory Investigation of Out of Specification Results.” However, you have not assessed how your reliance on the incomplete and inaccurate data generated by the CQC laboratory, which was operational until April 2012, may have affected the quality of your APIs.   In response to this letter, address how your firm intends to ensure the reliability and completeness of all records of analytical data generated at your facility.  Specify the measures you have implemented to ensure your quality unit oversees documentation procedures and reviews all test results generated by all of your laboratories, including the electronic data generated for drugs manufactured and tested at your facility.  2.    Failure to prevent unauthorized access or changes to data, and to provide adequate controls to prevent omission of data.  During the inspection we found the following examples of uncontrolled access to electronic systems used to generate data in your Product Development Laboratory (PD Lab). a.    Your HPLC systems are configured so that no passwords are required to log in. Credentials are unverified.  Anyone who accesses the system can use software administrator privileges, which means that there is no electronic or procedural control to prevent manipulation of data. b.    Your HPLC system had no access controls to prevent alteration or deletion of data. Furthermore, your HPLC software lacked an audit trail feature to document all activities related to the chromatographic analysis.  Because of this failure, neither your quality unit nor your laboratory staff could demonstrate that HPLC records included complete and unaltered data. They were also unable to verify that there had been no alterations or deletions. c.    One of your analysts stated that another, unknown individual had logged into the system using the analyst’s credentials.  This unknown individual performed injections and deletions without the analyst’s knowledge. According to your December 15, 2014 response, you used the equipment and systems in the PD Lab to conduct non-CGMP activities, which you characterize as “extended” investigations to identify impurities in APIs and intermediates, improve processes, qualify sources of key starting materials, and conduct laboratory experiments to address Drug Master File (DMF) deficiencies. Your response is inadequate, because many of these activities are subject to CGMP. Additionally, you based final disposition decisions on uncontrolled investigations conducted in the PD Lab.   In your response to this letter, explain how you will ensure that all analyses performed in support of product disposition decisions and other CGMP activities will be reviewed, approved, and overseen by your quality unit.  Provide specific details of the steps you have taken to prevent unauthorized access to your electronic data systems and to ensure that data systems retain complete, accurate, reliable, and traceable results of analyses performed. 3.    Failure to record activities at the time they are performed. Your employees did not complete batch production and control records immediately after activities were performed. When QA reviewers noticed missing entries in the batch records, they made a list of all the missing items on separate, uncontrolled pieces of paper that were provided to the production manager. Data were later entered into CGMP documents after operations had already ended as though they had been entered at the time of the operation.   For example, on November 17, 2014, we saw eight production records for (b)(4) and (b)(4) that had blank entries for weights of material used for production, checked-by signatures, accessories used, in-house batch numbers, quantity added, and product labeling for material dried specimens. The yield report sheet and batch summary sheet were also incomplete.  Missing information was recorded on uncontrolled sheets of paper instead of in your official records.  Your staff told us that they write on sheets of paper to make management aware of missing data in the batch record.  Your December 15, 2014 response to this finding stated, “[w]e acknowledge and regret that some of the data such as weights, checked by signature etc…were not entered” (sic). You claim this practice was only observed in records related to the manufacture of (b)(4) active ingredients, and that the missing entries for weights were due to manufacturing equipment inadequacies.  These explanations do not justify your use of uncontrolled paper for documenting CGMP-relevant data, nor do they justify your failure to document events and information contemporaneously. For example, it is unacceptable to use uncontrolled sheets of paper to document deviations from the manufacturing process, regardless of whether such deviations are critical or non-critical. Even non-critical deviations from established procedures should be documented and explained, and reviewed and approved by your quality unit prior to the release of your intermediates or APIs. In response to this letter, provide an assessment of the effects of your poor documentation practices on the quality of other batches produced in your facility. Specify when you discontinued using unofficial paper records, how you will prevent this practice from reoccurring, and the controls you are implementing to ensure that all CGMP-related operations are documented as they occur. 4.    Failure to control the issuance, revision, superseding and withdrawal of all documents with maintenance of revision histories. a.    Your SOP 01-017/02 “Documentation Practices” requires that all controlled documents are completed and archived. However, on November 17, 2014, our investigator observed copies of issued, partially-used and unused batch records, analytical raw data, analytical results, training records, and cleaning validation protocols in the waste area.  These controlled documents had not been completed or archived in accordance with your SOP on documentation practices. b.    During the inspection, investigators observed master batch records in the manufacturing areas, even though they were required to remain under the control of the quality unit. We also found a production employee with a quality unit document control stamp. In your response to the Form FDA-483, you confirmed that your amended SOP 01-018 “Preparation, Issue, Filling and Verification of Batch Production Record” (sic) stipulates that this stamp should remain in the possession of only quality unit personnel.  In your December 15, 2014 response, you stated, “[w]e regret that the documents referred under this observation were scrapped and found disposed of in the waste area without adhering to proper verification and authorization procedures.  There was a lapse in the document control system…” You proposed a revised procedure and staff re-training. We acknowledge your commitment to retrain your employees on your revised procedure. However, your response is inadequate because revising your SOP and re-training staff do not provide a comprehensive assessment of the extent of your practice of placing controlled records in the waste area, outside of the document control system.  You also have not evaluated all records of products that remain within a retesting period to determine whether any records related to such products were discarded without quality unit approval.  In your response to this letter, provide specific changes made to your procedures, and how you intend to ensure oversight from your quality unit over the management of batch production records.  Provide details on how you will implement a reliable document control system to ensure that batch records are only generated and approved by your quality unit. B.     Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited CTO Unit V (FEI: 3005447965) 1.    Failure to adequately investigate out-of-specification results and implement appropriate corrective actions.  a.    Our investigator documented that five batches of (b)(4) intermediate failed the optical purity test by HPLC, which test is included in your Drug Master File for (b)(4). In your response of February 19, 2015, you acknowledged that, since 2012, 11 batches had failed the optical purity test, and that you had been unable to determine a root cause for such failures. Although all batches passed the optical rotation test found in the United States Pharmacopeia, you did not establish a correlation between the optical purity and optical rotation tests or report that you had identified an alleged root cause until May 19, 2015.  Your response is inadequate in that you provide no data to demonstrate that the conditions identified as the alleged root causes for the failures were actually observed in the failing batches.  Moreover, you did not assess passing batches to determine if any of these same alleged conditions were present. b.    Our investigator documented 13 instances of out of specification results for a single impurity found in your (b)(4) intermediate for (b)(4). In your February 19, 2015 response, you indicate that, since 2012, 65 batches of this intermediate failed to meet the single impurity specification. This represents (b)(4) of your entire production of this intermediate, a failure rate you acknowledged as high. In your response, you described your efforts to characterize and identify the impurity, determine the chemistry formation of the impurity, and your on-going work to try to minimize the formation of the impurity, identified as (b)(4).  Although we acknowledge these efforts, your response is inadequate because you have yet to find a process solution to minimize the formation of this impurity, and propose continuing to reprocess those batches that do not meet the established specifications. Your response lacks a justification for not including the reprocessing step as part of your routine manufacturing process.   In response to this letter, explain your plans to revalidate the manufacturing process for (b)(4) API. 2.    Failure to maintain all quality-related documents appropriately. Although your SOP GQA018-00, “Documentation Control, Archival and Destruction,” does not permit photocopying labels, during the inspection we observed numerous pre-filled, photocopied labels for (b)(4) API in the garbage. These photocopied labels included the name of the product, material code, batch number, drum number, net weight, batch quantity, signature and date. According to your February 19, 2015 response, “photocopying of the labels has not been a routine practice.” Your investigation found that these labels “were intended for process/equipment status identification, which will be destroyed after completion of the process step” and are used for blend material in your (b)(4) blending, (b)(4) and packing area.  Your response to this observation does not adequately explain how the use of pre-filled photocopied labels may have affected the quality and traceability of the APIs you manufacture, nor does it indicate your plans for implementing procedures to prevent the use of uncontrolled photocopied labels.  In your response to this letter, provide your improved procedures to reconcile the quantities of labels issued, and for ensuring that you use the correct labels in your manufacturing operations. 3.    Failure to prevent unauthorized access or changes to data. During the inspection, we found that QC laboratory analysts were authorized to release finished product in your firm’s computerized SAP inventory management system. Release or rejection of finished product is a non-delegable responsibility of the quality unit, and cannot be shared with laboratory analysts or other personnel. However, your SAP system permitted QC laboratory analysts to release intermediates from one process to the next process, as well as to release finished product into the market without requiring quality unit oversight. In your February 19, 2015 response, you acknowledged that your SAP system permitted QC laboratory analysts to release intermediates and APIs, including release of finished API for distribution.  However, you claimed that QC did not actually release finished API for commercial distribution using SAP because your quality unit is bound by SOP #01-021, “QA Release,” which provides for quality unit oversight.  You also stated that you had “unambiguously verified that not a single commercial API batch has been released by QC alone” (sic) within the timeframe of January to December 2014. You acknowledged the need to build additional controls into your SAP system, and committed to amend the SAP configuration and stop solely relying on the SOP as the control tool.  You also committed to review all batches manufactured and distributed from the site to determine if any products had been released for commercial distribution by QC alone.  On May 21, 2015, you reported that three batches of an API (not identified in your correspondence) were released for commercial distribution by a QC analyst in 2013.  You concluded that this was an isolated incident.   In subsequent correspondence dated September 14, 2015, you stated that allowing QC analysts to release batches of intermediates was a deliberate part of Dr. Reddy’s control strategy: this “functionality in SAP was given to QC personnel to allow the release of intermediates only for internal use in additional processing without QA intervention.” You reiterated that your review of the release process over two years indicated that “the process operated as intended with no deviations,” even though you had just reported such a deviation to the FDA in your May 2015 correspondence.   In your response to this letter, explain the discrepancy between your May 2015 report regarding release of API by a QC analyst and your September 2015 assertion that no such deviations had transpired over the course of two years.  Describe the improvements made to the configuration of your SAP system, including controls to limit analyst functions and specifically to prevent QC analysts from releasing finished API or intermediates for commercial distribution.  Explain further how your SAP system has been re-configured to reflect the quality unit’s oversight of QC decisions to release intermediate for further use.  Finally, show how your SOP on commercial release is aligned with the configuration and functionality of your SAP system.  4.    Failure to identify storage containers for intermediates in batch production records. During the inspection, we observed that you had not recorded identification numbers in your product batch records for drums used to hold intermediates during manufacturing. We also observed that you had not implemented necessary controls to prevent mix-ups and contamination.  In your February 19, 2015 response, you acknowledged these problems. You indicated that you have revised your batch records to require identification of equipment, replaced dedicated (b)(4) drums with (b)(4) bags, and amended your cleaning SOP.  In response to this letter, provide data to demonstrate that the (b)(4) bags you have substituted do not affect the quality of the intermediates you store in them.   C.    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited Unit VII (FEI: 3006549835)  1.    Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed. (21 CFR 211.192) On March 3, 2015, during the filling operation for (b)(4) injection (b)(4)mg/ml, batch (b)(4) in Block (b)(4), our investigator documented a malfunction in the (b)(4) mechanism used to transport (b)(4) filled vials (b)(4) headed towards the (b)(4). The (b)(4) mechanism (b)(4) the (b)(4) approximately (b)(4) of the correct (b)(4) before it malfunctioned and stopped.  On March 3, 2015, our investigator notified your Associate Director of Quality Assurance, your Resource Manager of Quality Assurance, and your Associate Director and Head Operations about the (b)(4) mechanism failure.  However, contrary to your SOP FTCQA011-08, “Reporting, Investigating and Disposition of Incidents,” your management failed to intervene, and allowed the filling process to continue uninterrupted.  During the filling operation, our investigator observed an operator repeatedly using forceps and an (b)(4) hand to (b)(4) the (b)(4) manually and align the (b)(4) with the (b)(4) conveyor belt. The operator intervened again to (b)(4) the (b)(4) onto the (b)(4) conveyor belt. Because the conveyor belt was not operational, an operator manually intervened to (b)(4) the vials into the (b)(4) loading area, where the (b)(4) the (b)(4) into the (b)(4).  Your production manager said that approximately (b)(4) filled vials on approximately (b)(4) were transported in this manner. He said that the filling operation had to be completed within (b)(4) due to (b)(4) issues with the product in (b)(4).  Each of these manual interventions risks compromising the sterility of the product and is a deviation from your approved SOP No. OPR052-05, “Operation of (b)(4) Filling Line (b)(4)” for filling (b)(4) injection (b)(4) mg/ml.  You did not simulate these critical manual interventions during media fills, so you have no basis to know whether they may compromise the sterility of your products. Understanding the effects of these interventions is especially important because the exposed product (b)(4). Even though your senior management was notified of this failure, you did not initiate an incident report to investigate the equipment malfunction or determine the effects of this discrepancy on the quality of the product until we concluded our inspection and issued a Form 483. Your March 27, 2015 response stated “we recognize and accept that there was a malfunction of the (b)(4) assembly… this was a unique and a ‘one off’ failure which has not occurred in the past.”  You acknowledged that, in accordance with your own SOP, you should have registered a formal incident. You attributed the malfunction to a failed (b)(4) holding the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) mechanism. Your investigation concluded that, since all operations are carried out (b)(4), the sterility hazard is remote. Your response is inadequate. Although you acknowledged the unwarranted delay in initiating your investigation into the (b)(4) mechanism breakdown, your conclusion that potential effects on sterility were remote is unjustified because you have not simulated the manual interventions in your media fills.  We note that the lack of adequate investigations is a repeat violation from our February 2008 inspection.  In response to this letter, provide your plan to improve your investigations of critical process deviations. Include the changes you will implement to ensure that media fills provide adequate simulations.  Detail how the critical interventions that may compromise the sterility of a product will be minimized in your aseptic processing operation. 2.    Your firm failed to follow appropriate written procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, and that include validation of all aseptic and sterilization processes (21 CFR 211.113(b)). Your media fill record reconciliation documentation failed to include a full accounting and description of the units rejected from each batch. Although a significant number of media-filled units were rejected with no written justification, we found the following media fills runs deemed as acceptable.  Media fill batch #Run dateFilled unitsRejected units(b)(4)October 30, 2014(b)(4)81(b)(4)October 27, 2014(b)(4)21(b)(4)September 14, 2014(b)(4)36(b)(4)August 1, 2014(b)(4)249(b)(4)May 26, 2014(b)(4)64(b)(4)December 20, 2013(b)(4)121(b)(4)November 28, 2013(b)(4)5(b)(4)November 27, 2013(b)(4)35(b)(4)November 19, 2013(b)(4)185 According to your March 27, 2015 response, you explained the kind of defects observed, and revised your procedures to clarify the type of rejects. Your response is inadequate. The media-fill records do not include reasons why filled vials were rejected.  In addition, the total number of rejected media-filled vials does not include the vials that the (b)(4) automatically rejected.  Your justification is not acceptable for excluding units removed during processing, or excluding units that were not incubated because of interventions.  In response to this letter, provide the findings of a risk assessment to determine the effects of your exclusion criteria on all the products manufactured during the period of the referenced media fills. Provide your revised media fill procedures to demonstrate how you have modified your exclusion criteria and ensured that your media fills accurately reflect the process you use to manufacture sterile products. The lack of appropriate written procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile is a repeat violation from our February 2008 inspection. For our current thinking on how to meet CGMP when manufacturing sterile drugs using aseptic processing, we recommend you review the FDA’s guidance for industry, Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing —Current Good Manufacturing Practice, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm070342.pdf.  3.    Your firm failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process controls designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess, and your firm’s quality control unit did not review and approve those procedures, including any changes. (21 CFR 211.100(a))  Parenteral drugs must be essentially free of particulates. However, during the inspection, we observed that your procedure for qualifying the operators who perform visual inspection is unacceptable because you did not document the creation of inspectors’ qualification kits. The challenge test set vials used to qualify your operators were inadequate because particle size in the kits is not specified. There is thus no way to determine if the kits themselves are sufficient to qualify inspectors under the essentially-free standard. Our investigators also documented that your qualification kits for visual inspectors are created (b)(4) and destroyed after use. In your March 27, 2015 response, you stated that you will create a protocol for preparing new qualification kits and documenting employees’ qualifications.  Your response is inadequate.  You did not indicate how previously inspected products may have been affected by your substandard visual inspection procedures and qualification kits. You also failed to provide the new protocol. Additionally, you did not provide any details on how you intend to train and qualify operators or measure the effectiveness of the new qualification kits. In response to this letter, assess the effects of your lack of adequate visual inspection procedures and training on all the quality of all batches inspected by operators who were improperly trained and qualified, and provide a summary of your findings. In your summary, note whether each affected product has been distributed or rejected.  Also describe the actions you have implemented to ensure that the finished parenteral drugs you manufacture are essentially free of particulate matter.   Conclusion Violations and deviations cited in this letter are not intended as an all-inclusive list. You are responsible for determining the causes of these violations and deviations, for preventing their recurrence, and for preventing other violations and deviations.    These items, as well as other deficiencies our investigators found, lead us to question the effectiveness of your current corporate quality system to achieve overall compliance with CGMP.  Several violations are recurrent or represent long-standing failures to adequately resolve significant manufacturing quality problems. It is apparent that you have not implemented a robust quality system at your sites.  Dr. Reddy’s corporate management is responsible for ensuring the quality, safety, and integrity of all drugs you manufacture. FDA strongly recommends that you evaluate global manufacturing operations to ensure compliance with CGMP regulations and requirements, comprehensively and immediately.   If, as a result of receiving this warning letter or for other reasons, you are considering a decision that could reduce the number of active pharmaceutical ingredients and/or finished products produced by your manufacturing facility, FDA requests that you contact CDER’s Drug Shortages Staff immediately, as you begin your internal discussions, at drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov.  so that we can work with you on the most effective way to bring your operations into compliance with the law.  Contacting the Drug Shortages Staff also allows you to meet any obligations you may have to report discontinuances in your drug manufacture under 21 U.S.C. 356C(a)(1) and allows FDA to consider, as soon as possible, what actions, if any, may be needed to avoid shortages and protect the health of patients who depend on your products.  In appropriate cases, you may take corrective action without interrupting supply, or to shorten any interruption, thereby avoiding or limiting drug shortages. Until you complete all corrections and FDA confirms your compliance with CGMP, FDA may withhold approval of any new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug product or API manufacturer.  If you fail to correct these violations, under Section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3), FDA may also refuse admission of articles into the United States manufactured at: A.     Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, CTO Unit VI, APIIC Industrial Estate, Pydibhimavarma (Village), Ranasthalam Mandai, Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh, IndiaB.    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, CTO Unit V, Peddadevulapalli, Tripuraram, Mandal, Miryalguda Taluk, Nalgonda District, Telangana, IndiaC.    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Limited Unit VII, Plot No. P1 to P9, Phase III, Duvvada, VSEZ, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India Under Section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3), articles may be refused admission because manufacturing methods and controls do not appear to conform to CGMP within the meaning of Section 501 (a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351 (a)(2)(B). Within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office, in writing, of the specific steps that you have taken to correct and prevent repeating these deviations and violations. In addition to the specific requests noted above, supporting documentation should include a third party assessment of the following: 1.    A comprehensive evaluation of the extent of inaccuracies in recorded and reported data. Include a detailed action plan to fully investigate the extent and root causes of your deficient documentation and data management practices. A risk assessment of the potential effects of observed failures on the quality of your drug products, including the effects of your deficient practices on the quality of drug products released for distribution and whether submissions to FDA may have been impacted. Conduct the same assessment for APIs that are components of drugs in applications that not yet been approved but which are pending before the FDA. 2.    A management strategy for your firm that includes the details of your global corrective action and preventive action plan.  Actions you have taken or will take may include:contacting your customersrecalling productconducting additional testing adding lots to your stability programs to assure stabilitymonitoring complaintsrevising proceduresimplementing new controlstraining or re-training personnel If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reasons for the delay and the date by which you will have completed the corrections.  If you no longer manufacture or distribute the drug products or APIs at issue, provide the date(s) and reason(s) you ceased production.  Send your reply to:  Maan Abduldayem, Compliance OfficerOffice of Manufacturing QualityFood and Drug AdministrationWhite Oak, Building 51, Room 421210903 New Hampshire Ave. Silver Spring, MD 20993 Please identify your response with FEI 3002949085 (CTO Unit VI), FEI 3005447965 (CTO Unit V), and FEI 3006549835 (Unit VII).  Sincerely,/S/                 Thomas Cosgrove, J.D.DirectorOffice of Manufacturing QualityOffice of ComplianceCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and a very warm welcome to the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories' Limited First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only-mode. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. 
I now hand the conference over to Mr. Saunak Savla. Thank you and over to you sir. 
Saunak Savla
Yeah, a very good morning and good evening to all of you, and thank you for joining us today for the Dr. Reddy's Earnings Conference call for the first quarter ended 30 June, 2017. Earlier during the day we have released our results and the same are also posted on our website. We are conducting a live webcast of this call and the transcript shall be available on our website soon. 
The discussion and analysis in this call will be based on the IFRS consolidated financial statement. To discuss the business performance and outlook, we have the leadership team of Dr. Reddy, comprising Mr. G.V. Prasad, our CEO; Mr. Abhijit Mukherjee, our COO; Mr. Saumen Chakraborty, our CFO; Mr. Anil Namboodiripad, who is the Head of our Proprietary Products Business and the Investor Relations team.
Please note that today's call is a copyrighted material of Dr. Reddy and cannot be rebroadcasted or attributed in press or media outlets without the company's expressed written consent. 
Before we proceed on to the call, I would like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to the conference call and the webcast.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Saumen Chakraborty, our CFO.
Saumen Chakraborty
Thank you, Saunak. Greetings to everyone. Let me begin with key financial highlights. For this section, all the amounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the convenient translation rate of 64.62, which is the rate as of June 30, 2017.
Consolidated revenues for the quarter of INR 3,316 crores or $513 million, grew 3% year-on-year but declined 7% sequential. Sequential decline is primarily attributable to the lower sales in our domestic formulation business, due to channel destocking during GST transition and quarterly fluctuates in our PSAI business.
Revenues from Global Generic segment at $425 million, and PSAI segment is $72 million. Consolidated gross profit margin for the quarter is at 51.6%. This quarter we had some very good launches in North America generic business. However, considering that most are follow-on launches their contribution in this quarter is low.
There were few key external or market dynamics responsible for pulling down the margin, against our more recent benchmarks. These are: One, incremental price erosion in the base business in US, in addition to increased competitive intensity in some of the key molecules, enhanced customer consolidation, lead erosion, played out beyond our earlier estimate.
Two, GST transition impact. This transition was characterized by significant deduction in the channel offtake and also higher return. In order to ensure adequate product availability in the marketplace, we have to make certain one-time interventions in the form of selective incentivisation, public compensation for any loss incurred by them, with respect to the channel inventory. These channel interventions have grossly impacted the margin.

Three, adverse impact of manufacturing overhead deleverage. During the quarter we had lower reported sales, partly as a consequence of GST implementation and partly on account of quarter getting [indiscernible]. These factors should get normalized going forward. And four, adverse movement in currency rates. During the quarter the U.S. dollar net delivered rate depreciated against the rupee. The USD rate is now stabilized around 64 to 64.5 range.
SG&A spend, including amortization for the quarter is INR1,176 crores, or $182 million, a decrease of 4% year-on-year due to reduction in spend on limitation-related [ph] expenses. We continue to explore revenue to optimize the spending.
R&D expense for the quarter are at INR 507 crores or $79 million, representing 15.3% to revenues. This spend is in line with the ongoing set of development activities as planned. EBITDA for the quarter stands at INR 336 crores, which is $52 million, and is around 10% of revenue. Out net debt-to-equity ratio stands at $0.29 as on 30 June, 2017.
The effective tax rate is around 23.5% for the quarter. And we anticipate it to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the full year. Key balance sheet highlights are as follows: Our operating working capital increased by INR 283 crores or $44 million during this quarter, primarily due to increase in receivables in North America generic business. We remained focused on optimizing the working capital cycle.
Capital expenditure for the quarter were INR 272 crores or $42 million. Foreign currency cash flow ranges for the next nine months in the form of derivatives for U.S. dollar are approximately $240 million, largely hedged around the range of INR 66.3 to INR 68.7 to the dollar. In the recent we have balance sheet hedged of $374 million. We also have foreign currency cash flow hedges of 900 million ruble at the rate of rupees 1.135 to the ruble, maturing over next nine months. 
With this I now request Abhijit to take through the key business highlights. 
Abhijit Mukherjee
Thank you, Saumen. Greetings to everybody, and I extend a warm welcome to you on this earnings conference call. Let me take you through some of the business highlights for each of our key markets. 
Please note that in this section, all references to numbers are in respective local currencies. Our North America revenues for the quarter are at $230 million, on Q-on-Q basis we have managed to sustain the overall business and in fact grew marginally despite multiple challenges. 
Our base business witnessed pricing pressures driven by enhanced channel consolidation and increased competitive intensity on a couple of key assets; Ezetimibe and Bivalirudin [ph]. With further consolidation among buyers consortium we expect the adverse pricing environment to persist going forward. 
We had a fairly reasonable quarter in terms of new product with four launches, G-Vytorin has been a successful launch with strong contracted market share. We also had doxorubicin liposomal injection, our first complex injectable. We are ramping up market share and since most of these are follow on launches we expect to peak in terms of value contribution over next couple of quarters.
With respect to the pipeline we continue to work with agency on the approval of our assets and remain optimistic on 2 to 3 launches per quarter. However quality overhang at our injectable facility may impact approval time range for few of our key assets. 
Continuing on pure generics, our Europe business is fairly stable now and well poised to deliver a profitable growth on the back of new product launches and traction in the new markets. Our emerging markets business is on track to gradual recovery. Russia business grew 31% y-o-y in local currency. During the quarter we had our first shipment of Rituximab with a secure share under the national tender. Ex-rituximab the growth is in line with expectations. 

We continue to focus on improving productivity and on maintaining the pipeline. Ex-Russia the performance of the other markets were also in line with our expectations. We are well on track to expand our presence leveraging our institutional business portfolio and biosimilars. Commercialization of biosimilars across emerging markets has started to gain meaningful traction. We remain optimistic of building on this momentum further. 
India business revenues are at INR469 crores and declined 10% Y-o-Y, 18% Q-o-Q. The nation implemented one of the largest and significant transitions to a progressive taxation regime in this quarter. We are witnessing a lot of transition challenges and we are working towards those. 
There was an evident disruption in the normal flow of activities and we had our share of impact. As discussed earlier, the decline in domestic businesses is resulting from channel destocking due to transition to the GST regime, which obviously had sizable impact on our quarterly performance, there are some teething issues still being resolved and it will take some time for all the industry to return to normalcy. 
Subject to this we continue to focus on productivity improvement and portfolio augmentation. The API business posted revenues of $72 million. Our efforts are directed towards building a healthy order book. Our proprietary product business we continue to execute our strategy of expanding Zembrace and Sernivo. Over the past quarters we had several successful initiative to accelerate volume growth. Effective this quarter we have started focusing on more on improving the net realization through optimal payor coverage. 
On R&D front, the pipeline is continuing to grow. Overall progress in R&D program milestones are on track. This concludes my part. Now I will handover to Prasad for his comments. 
GV Prasad
Thank you Abhijit, thank you Sauman. From the preceding discussions on the PPT discussions you have an idea of the challenge that we face ahead. Delays in approvals, additional competition, regulatory actions have all combined to put significant pressure on our performance.
Given these circumstances we have -- we the management of Dr. Reddy’s have done a strategic review of the various businesses and initiatives and have developed three high priorities for our team. The first one is of course strengthening our manufacturing and quality system. Our first priority to ensure that our manufacturing systems meet the highest level of quality and compliance. We will need to modernize some of our infrastructure, systematically implement our new quality management system and automate some of the critical manufacturing and quality related processes. To accomplish this, a number of initiatives have been taken up across all locations and this would take us a few more quarters to complete. 
The second priority is to revitalize growth. Our efforts to deliver a healthy pipeline of products, enabling sustainable high performance are on, and we’re focused on accelerating the development of our complex generics portfolio and also making efforts to ensure that the approvals come in time through appropriate risk management and proactive measures to deal with possible deficiencies. 
We’re also registering our assets in several countries beyond the U.S., in emerging markets to drive growth. This is our second priority. The third priority is really to look at our cost structure and optimize that. Over the years our fixed cost structures have outpaced our growth in revenue and we feel this must be corrected now to enable us to compete effectively in the market place. We’ve embarked on a systematic exercise to transition to a linear and flexible cost structure, focus on areas such as network rationalization, improving plant operating efficiency, R&D site optimization and productivity as well as portfolio rationalization has the potential to deliver significant savings. And we’ve already made a firm start and we expect to see some results starting this year onwards. 

So this concludes my commentary I’ll hand it back to you Saunak.
Saunak Savla
Hello, so we can have the Q&A session now.
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator 
Sure sir. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take the first question from the line of Prakash Aggarwal from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.
Prakash Agarwal
Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Just trying to understand the gross margin, you did mention about the India GST impact. Just trying to understand without that impact what would have been the gross margin, given the fact that we have started to see limited competition products in the U.S.?
Saumen Chakraborty
Yeah I basically spoke about four points, which had overall contributed on a year-on-year basis, about 450 to 500 basis points deduction in gross margin. So if you see relatively the maximum impact comes from the North America Generics price erosion. And then second comes from the GST. This is specific quarter impact that we see. And of course the third one is that manufacturing overhead deleverage which is directly attributable to a level of sales, as the sales increase, definitely that we have normalized. And the fourth which is much lesser impact is due to the currency rate. 
Prakash Agarwal
Yeah, if we exclude the GST impact sir, what could have been the normalized, because that’s something which is really one-off?
Saumen Chakraborty
That as well as the manufacturing overhead deleverage, both would be really a quarter specific kind of thing. So we will not able to exactly give what will be the -- what would have been the thing but it will be grossly in the range of around 53 to 54, in that percentage.
Prakash Agarwal
Okay, and we would assume -- or is it fair to assume that this is the base case now given the fact that the approvals and launches have begun during the quarter. So you’ll have full quarter impact going forward. So this should ideally improve going forward?
Saumen Chakraborty
Yeah assuming no further erosions takes place. 
Prakash Agarwal
And the erosion is in line with what you have guided in the past. I mean what you have seen in the past?
Saumen Chakraborty
If it's more than what we would have expected and in annual report we mentioned that we feel -- we said, based on last year the huge erosion which has happened, which was much higher than the previous year. So we felt that this year it would be more calibrated. But it is more than our expectation, our estimate. Erosion has been more both because of the intensity of competition as well as the customer consolidation between the three players having 82%, 85% of the market and this is the quarter when most of the RFPs happen from different customer. So that impact is felt. 
We could not have felt it, say in April and May, mostly it happens in June. So then we understand that our initial estimates were lesser than what has actually happened in actual.
Prakash Agarwal
So any broad range or -- I mean 12% plus minus or?
GV Prasad
Yes, it is double in double digits. Two major assets I mentioned itself account for about a dozen [ph] million Q impact, [indiscernible]. 
Prakash Agarwal
Perfect, thanks. I’ve more questions, and I’ll join back the queue.
Operator 
Thank you. We’ll take the next question from line of Kumar Saurabh from Motilal Oswal Securities. Please go ahead.
Kumar Saurabh
Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. So sir as you mentioned just a follow-up, I believe that only in the month of June we could realize the impact of re-negotiation of RFPs but does that mean that the full quarter impact we will be seeing in the second quarter?
Saumen Chakraborty
No some of them had a retrospective effect as well as from 1st of April.
Kumar Saurabh
Okay. So, going forward if no further pressure comes from here onwards, ideally the margin should improve, ex of GST, I am talking about, US business only?

Saumen Chakraborty
You cannot take it for granted. Normally, it is a practice of annual RFP. But one cannot take it for granted 
Kumar Saurabh
Yes, no, no. I’m assuming that because we have good product approvals, which have come and which are expected to come in coming quarters, so taking that into account, we should see some kind of respite.
Saumen Chakraborty
Yeah, hopefully.
Kumar Saurabh
And sir India business, in the current quarter are we seeing -- how confident are we that we will be able to recouped the impact which we witnessed in 1Q?
Saumen Chakraborty
We are seeing some recovery. Confidence level is there that whatever GST impact one has seen it is -- should be limited to Q1.
Kumar Saurabh
And we should see that full recovery coming in quarter two?
Saumen Chakraborty
I can't comment on full recovery. There will be recovery?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes, overall I think couple of quarters, I think it's -- the current run rate is very good. It is temporary hit unlike the headwinds of pricing in North America. So I think shouldn’t be that big a concern.
Kumar Saurabh
Sure, sure. So sir, as you mentioned that there were couple of one offs and the US business price erosion was there, so how should we look at what is the normalized margins going forward, we should look at, from second half FY '18 onwards?
GV Prasad
I wouldn't comment on that, these are difficult to sort out to predict, I think the key issue is getting the approval and launches. That would be the probably way the most impacting factor. The headwinds which are beyond our control, we can’t do much and there isn't too much of a point trying to predict that. Overall what we’re saying is, it has been a little more intense than what we thought. 
Yes, I do agreed that the -- some of the juicy assets have already weed out. But hopefully let’s see whether it stabilizes a little or not
.
Kumar Saurabh
And in terms of growth strategy, the high priority which we talked about revitalizing growth and cost control. Is there any change in strategy in terms of focus area, in terms of geographic focus? So U.S. has been our key focus area and given the challenges which we are seeing, is it fair to assume that the focus should be more in other geographies as well, or in terms of geographic focus we still continue to focus on US and India as our core markets. 
Abhijit Mukherjee
The core markets are beyond US and India. US, Russia, some select large emerging markets and India. The focus on US continues. The -- most of the assets that we are developing are targeted towards the U.S., but we will leverage them in Europe as well as in all other parts of the world. We have increased our globalization of select high value assets, including biosimilars. So to that extent we are seeing more activity in the emerging markets in the medium term. So but that's not going to be a head against the U.S. The U.S. is such a large market that any other market or even a collection of markets cannot replace the growth we hope to see in the U.S.
Operator
Kumar I'm sorry to interrupt, but I would request you to come back in queue for any follow-up questions. [Operator Instructions]. We have the next question from the line of Neha Manpuria from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Neha Manpuria
Thanks so much for taking my questions. My first question is on the other expenses SG&A expense excluding depreciation and amortization. The base seems pretty high for the quarter. Is there some incentive payments et cetera in the quarter, or is this the new base new normal for SG&A?
Saumen Chakraborty
If you see year-on-year there has been a decline in the SG&A. Quarter-on-quarter, in the last quarter if you remember, we have talked about certain specific long-term incentives and others which were earlier accounted for but was reversed because we didn't pay due to non-performance. So that with the previous quarter manpower cost would have been lower than normal. 

Now what you see this quarter is a fair indication after all the increment cost that has been built in to manpower cost, but our endeavor internally is to continue to improve on these and reduce further. 
Neha Manpuria
So for all purposes this is the new base for our cost going forward, for the time being?
Saumen Chakraborty
We will say this will be something for which we need to improve further quarter-on-quarter. 
Neha Manpuria
And sir, when you mentioned our efforts to sort of improve our cost structure to make it more lean and therefore you're expecting certain synergies. Is there a number for the synergy or sorry, for this savings that can be expected from a cost control over the medium term probably not for FY18 but how much do you think we can improve our costs by. 
Saumen Chakraborty
So we are working on this project right now. It's going to be quite substantial. I don't have an exact number but it's 100 crores kind of possibility to take cost away. Multiple hundreds of crores. 
Neha Manpuria
Okay. And my second question is on the proprietary business, the license -- the out licensing agreement that we announced yesterday for DFA 02. I mean is there a change in the way we are looking at the proprietary business in terms of commercializing these assets ourselves?
GV Prasad
Well, is Anil on the call. Could Anil answer this.
Anil Namboodiripad
Yeah, I'm on the call. Prasad you want comment first or you want me to take --. 
GV Prasad
Broadly I'm saying that we are looking at more differentiated assets and assets more aligned with our sales force. And the head line message but I leave it to you to give it more color Anil. Anil, go ahead. 
Anil Namboodiripad
Yeah, so specifically this particular asset that we licensed is a high value asset, but it was within a therapeutic area that we are not focusing on at this point in time. It's for the acute care hospital markets. So we felt that it is best developed at the hands of somebody else. And we believe the CHD Biosciences is a capable partner to develop this particular asset. The value of this asset is tremendously high, but we made a conscious decision to focus on two areas neurology and dermatology, hence this divestiture. 
Neha Manpuria
Okay. Are there any other such assets that we're looking at in the near term on the proprietary side or now most of the launches would be commercialized by Dr. Reddy's?
Anil Namboodiripad
There are couple of other assets that we believe are high value and do not fall within the preview of our strategic focus. And there are discussions ongoing about partnering those as well. But we cannot disclose at this time. 
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Anubhav Aggarwal from Credit Suisse. please go ahead.
Anubhav Aggarwal
Yeah thank you. One question is Srikakulam plant. Just wanted to understand that once this plant comes back -- once it gets a EIR, how much of PSI sales is impacted because this plant has a warning letter right now which can get, or which gets recovered
Second, how much is the unabsorbed fixed cost which is impacting our cost right now. So just trying to understand how much benefit we get once the plant comes back?
GV Prasad
So the warning letter never prevented us from marketing the product which were there already. So what it will have is some of the assets for the future approval. Some we have tech transfer and not relevant anymore, but for the future approvals it will have an impact. As far as unused or overheads, which are unutilized, I wouldn't make a very material impact. I think for sure the injectable plant, which I mentioned is more important in terms of the launches and it's extremely important to work towards getting it back.
Anubhav Aggarwal
Yeah, which is I was thinking more in terms of whether it had any impact on the PSAI business not just this quarter, but in general because…

Abhijit Mukherjee
Yeah. So it’ll be -- some impact will be there. The flow will improve of products, and we’ve been heavily focused on remediation. We’re trying to now focus on efficiencies on floor. So there will be some impact but it won’t be very huge.
Anubhav Aggarwal
Okay. That’s helpful. Second question on the PSAI business itself, and the composition of the business this quarter was very different from the trend that we’ve seen so far, where sales in Europe has significantly and sales in India has significantly picked up. On both counts, if you can explain that. And secondly, if this trend were to, let’s say remain, if when you sell a PSAI sales in India verses Europe, are the margins very different in the two categories or similar.
GV Prasad
No, this is a B2B business and I wouldn’t recommend -- I wouldn’t suggest that we read too much into regional sales from PSAI. These are depending on customers who pick what when. What is more is important is the last point we have mentioned that we were very focused on lot of remediation activities which sort of certainly had some disruptive effect on manufacturing and supplies. I think we would – we can focus much more now on supply chain – managing the supply chain better. So to that extent, I think it’ll be certainly beneficial and move upwards from here I guess.
Anubhav Aggarwal
Okay. Just last question on the US business. You quantified the price erosion year-on-year, Abhijit can you just give an idea sequentially as well the impact of price erosion in the US business.
A – Abhijit Mukherjee
Sequentially, is not right way to look at. But if you -- I’ll give you a broad study, which we did in terms of top eight or nine generic companies, if you add there erosion and you can get it from the IMS, and add it up and then take an average that will give you the industry. Because certain quarter we could be very high. Other companies will be low and could be vice-versa in subsequent quarters. 
So overall, the trend for the last eight quarters we studied, and it has been eing fairly steady a forward moving percentage. Two years back it was probably 5-6. It is trending between 10 to 20 right now. Now having said that look whether this whole consolidation also has broadly -- I think we've more or less seen seeing the end of it come going further between three players 85% of the market share. So whether it will plateau out a bit, time will tell.
Operator 
Thank you. We’ll take the next question from the line of Nimish Mehta, from Research Delta Advisors. Please go ahead.
Nimish Mehta
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. On the India’s business and specifically on the impact of GST, I just wanted to have a few clarifications. One obviously we got impacted because of the lower stage because of new [ph] stocking. But you also mentioned about we giving some compensation to the distributor for the kind of losses? So is there and first obviously whether my understanding is correct and if yes, what was that amount or can you quantify that?
GV Prasad
Specifically not, I don’t think so, but there was certainly enough confusion -- in the transition, some amount, is it very significant, no. But there was some efforts to sort of keep the stocks moving. We didn’t want also the retail sales to run dry and that would’ve been apart from anything else, which would have meant secondary sales loss, which was not correct to sort of in this confusion. So I wouldn’t be very much, but yes there were some.
Nimish Mehta
Okay. Understood. But that's not material, right that is what I understood?
GV Prasad
Not really significant, no.
Nimish Mehta
Okay. And second on the U.S. business you mentioned about two to three launches per quarter here, any guidance about how many high values launches specifically, launches like Copaxam [ph] will be appreciated.

GV Prasad
Difficult to say, two to three in numbers would happen and I think you're very right. I mean what is the quality of two to three would decide everything, there are few assets and there are also few concerns after injectable sites delay, but the numbers are there and there are fewer assets without getting into specific. If things go okay then we may see a few good launches.
Nimish Mehta
Quantify that, by how many (inaudible) two-three, three-four.
GV Prasad
We just can't, because the uncertainty is because of intellectual property are fixed to faith[ph] and FDA’s approval timelines are not in our control.
Nimish Mehta
Okay. Great. If I may squeeze in one, just wanted to know the fate of our biosimilars strategy now that Merck is opting out of the JV. So any thoughts that could be?
GV Prasad
Well Fresenius who is the new owner of this business is very motivated to continue and we've had our meetings and it is going quite well. So they’ve acquired this business from Merck, they paid a lot of money. So we believe that they're very committed to building this business going forward.
Nimish Mehta
Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Sameer Baisiwala from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Sameer Baisiwala
Thanks. Good evening everyone. Abhijit, can you update us on the progress when with 13 observations, what's the way forward and would it require a second re-inspection?
Abhijit Mukherjee
This would require a secondary inspection, Sameer, so our position to have significant, we responded. But it will require another inspection. We are working towards it and normally one of the growth site is observation profound. There is secondary inspection and we would -- can't say exactly when we would sort of invite FDA back again, but we're working towards it. Yes.
Sameer Baisiwala
Okay. Is it say to say that Copaxone filing is being done from here? And so -- and that's what you have said few times on the call that because some of the injectables will get delayed? And second are you looking to site switch it?
GV Prasad
Copaxone is not from Duvvada, `there are others good at it, which are in the process of site switching. But site switching has some timeline delays. So let's see which comes through earlier and we'll take.
Abhijit Mukherjee
But optimistically, we expect to have FDA coming by the year-end, December.
Sameer Baisiwala
Okay. And just one last question. In the context of complex generics, can you update us the progress with the patches, how many you're working on and what's a sort of filing targets?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Not very significant, Sameer, I mean, there are -- there was one which we are little delayed, there is one still alive which we have settled and maybe Q2 next year, but these wouldn't really move revenues much, I think we are still banking a lot on injectable products filed both from our side and the partner sides.
Sameer Baisiwala
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Saion Mukherjee from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
Saion Mukherjee
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. On this cost cut and restructuring, is it possible to share like which business areas this would really come from and which line items are you talking about R&D employee cost, any color you can give on this?
GV Prasad
It's little too early to share such details but it is, when we will consider global R&D fights, R&D [indiscernible], manufacturing network, portfolio where we don’t have enough margin from rationalization of portfolio, number of different of activities. So at this point it's too preliminary to share so that level of detail.
Saion Mukherjee
But you think it should come through next year or if you’ll take longer for realizing these savings?

GV Prasad
We should start seeing impact from next year onwards and some impact in this year also.
Saion Mukherjee
Okay, okay, thank you. I’ll return back in the queue.
Operator 
Thank you. We’ll take the question from the line of Chirag Talati from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.
Chirag Talati
Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Firstly, is it fair to say that this quarter has not seen any impact from price erosion diffida being [ph] from the new competitor?
GV Prasad
Yes, some, yes.
Chirag Talati
That would be marginal in overall context of things.
GV Prasad
To an extent, yes.
Chirag Talati
Secondly, if you can help us for understand on your some books on product, is there any pending CRL, and if you have there and it there is so what are the timeline of refilling?
GV Prasad
We submitted the response on the complete response later. Now we are awaiting the judgment maybe four to eight weeks as you know it’s in litigation. The outcome is important for this asset. Of course, either way this can be, if the general experience in a way to overcome challenge and vice versa. But that’s the next important milestone. On the development front, I think, we feel very good about it.
Chirag Talati
Second, just kind of fast that the follow up query, was the last response submitted to the FDA?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yes, when? June, I guess, yes, June.
Chirag Talati
Okay, thank you.
Operator Thank you. We’ll take the next question from the line of Girish Bakhru from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Girish Bakhru
Yes, just similar question on NuvaRin, has the CRL been responded on that?
GV Prasad
Yes, around the same time and this is cleaner on the category front. We have had this on board Copaxone and NuvaRin in around on Q4 of the financial year. So we’ll see where it goes.
Girish Bakhru
On the litigation front, there is appeals case going on if I understand, although that’s on the activist in diem [ph] , but you don’t see that shouldn’t be I mean delaying it anyway beyond April 2018, right?
Abhijit Mukherjee
You’re talking of NuvaRin is it?
Girish Bakhru
Yes.
Abhijit Mukherjee
The [indiscernible] expires in April of next year in any case.
Girish Bakhru
Right, Abhijit any color on, I mean how soon you’ll see competition in this product, would it be like three year, no competition?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Those are difficult questions to answer. This was a certainly difficult question to answer. I wouldn’t know there is another asset we heard that it's in development. But these are complex to assess, I mean in terms of development FDA may ask questions and ask us well although, we feel good about our development but we will see. Difficult to say about others.
Girish Bakhru
Okay, idea I know on Copaxone again, when are we ready to re-file 40mg?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Very soon, in couple of weeks. 
Girish Bakhru
And just your follow-up on that if the decision on …
Abhijit Mukherjee
You are talking of the response to the CRL, right? I mean the updation of this thing. Yeah, couple of weeks.
Girish Bakhru
Yes, so if I understand the tat on 20mg is close and if you get positive response, approval on that, would it make you confident on 40mg as well or do you these two are separately linked.
Abhijit Mukherjee
So, firstly we have a tat but these are extremely complex assets. So naturally they would be -- they may not be [indiscernible] but they would be certainly questioned, and could the CRs as well. I don't know, I mean although we have done -- we think we have done a reasonably good job. But so to assume that everything is done is certainly optimistic but let's see. If the questions are not significantly I agree than that gives certainly a directional signal towards the whole asset. Because there's not much in the formulation side, it's actually the DMS which is the same and the view of that is more critical. 

Girish Bakhru
All right, thanks so much. 
Operator
Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Kartik Mehta from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Kartik Mehta
Just if we have to look the gross margin, which is there for the last two-three years, it has come up from about 60% to now around between 50% to 53%. Is that a reason where there is a structural issue, where we believe that since we are using third-parties to manufacture or there is higher competition, is it fair to assume that this now remains here or is there any scope for improvement? I just wanted to your thought on this. 
GV Prasad
Yeah, there's certainly room for improvement. The primary reason it has come down is also because of the price competition. And as we launch newer assets with higher margins the gross margin can go up. Our cost initiative should also help us and if you look at the current quarter there is some one time stuff also happening there. So I think gross margin should go up.
Your question about manufacturing third-party would that erode, I don’t think this is a very significantly factor, while it is a [indiscernible] cost. It's not a cost which can really change the economics of our business model.
Kartik Mehta
Sure, and if we have to look at the cost saving which you spoke about, would that -- and you entering into other markets, would M&A be a part of it because we have pretty low on debt and if we have to make entry an into any of the larger emerging markets with the pipeline that you have, would that be something that you consider?
GV Prasad
Largely we are looking at not inorganic entry because we are looking at institutional sales as the vehicle for entry into emerging markets. We don’t require large sales forces or establishments. So I don’t think we really need to do inorganic growth to expand our footprint in the markets that we are considering today. But if there is a good opportunity we will not be shy of that. 
Kartik Mehta
No, I meant in the markets where you are not there now, maybe some other markets in Europe.
GV Prasad
Well, in Europe we've already entered big five markets. We have two markets where we are selling products for a long time and we have established our presence in three other markets. So we don’t really need to do anything inorganic.
Kartik Mehta
Yeah, and on Doxil, just this one. So how do we record here the revenue and the profit given that we have a partner and so that would just help us in terms of the margins that could flow in the next quarters? Thanks. 
Abhijit Mukherjee
So it is a significant asset, it is certainly without giving a specific number, specifically we can address it and we are the dominant partner in the partnership. So based on that you'll have to sort of work in…
Kartik Mehta
Yeah, so I just actually wanted to know that do we record the revenue upfront and then there is a profit share, or I mean some how is it recorded, I don’t want to --
Abhijit Mukherjee
Full revenue, we book full revenue on…
Kartik Mehta
Okay. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Aditya Khemka from DSP Black Rock. Please go ahead. 
Aditya Khemka 
Yeah, hi thanks for the opportunity. Sir what would be the product concentration now in the U.S. business for us, I mean would the top five products account for 30%, 40%, 50% of our sales, just a ballpark number?
GV Prasad
It has reduced over the years. Right now I think -- if you take comparative figure we are lower than quite a few peers group companies, if you take the first two three year's type of a thing. But the figure which I have is available is top two assets is…
Abhijit Mukherjee
Top five would be around 25%.
GV Prasad
Yeah.
Aditya Khemka
Okay that’s helpful and sir just wanted to verify one number, Saunak mentioned that Q-on-Q because of [indiscernible] and one more asset he mentioned for these two products the price erosion has been about $11 million Q-on-Q?

GV Prasad
I don't know. 
Aditya Khemka
Yes. 
GV Prasad
So between [indiscernible]. 
Aditya Khemka
Okay and that was a sequential number right?
GV Prasad
That was a Q-on-Q.
Aditya Khemka
Okay, yeah, just wanted to check that, thank you. And just one last question on your take on the Bachupally Form 483, have you seen any product approvals since the Form 483 have been issued from Bachupally? And if not then would you -- is it fair to say that it is an OAI status with the FDA?
GV Prasad
The only one which is pending we mentioned I think last time is Atomoxetine and I think immature to conclude anything. I think we have responded adequately and there was just one follow up question out of many observations, which we have also responded. So we’ll see where it goes. 
Aditya Khemka
Sir, timeline discussed with the FDA on Bachupally or is there something that you have to wait for and see what the FDA does?
GV Prasad
Timelines, we have responded. So as I said response was sent, there was one clarification on one specific point. We have responded that as well so….
Aditya Khemka
When was this response sir?
GV Prasad
Last one was about a month back, I guess roughly our take. We’ll come back to you, month back, maybe about 15 days back or something, 15 days or a month back.
Aditya Khemka
Okay, fine. I’ll get back in the queue. Thanks.
Operator 
Thank you. We’ll take the next question from the line of Nitin Agarwal from IDFC Securities. Please go ahead.
Nitin Agarwal
Hi, thanks for taking my question. So you alluded a couple of times about this emerging market strategy. Can you just help us understand a bit in terms of potential of maybe if there are some illustrative examples of what is the kind of potential some of these assets have, relevant U.S. assets have, will you sort of take them on a pan Global footprint of sorts?
GV Prasad
It’s significant, I think I would maintain what I said in the earlier call. I think we are getting on the institutional strategy and leveraging our assets globally. We’re getting to Brazil as we speak into Q2 and we have three approvals, three products also getting launched, Q3 may see a couple of more approvals. 
These are big markets, smaller markets like Colombia and ASEAN markets, biosimilars taking or gaining more momentum. So overall it’s not something which will be quick, one quarter type of thing but we’re doing it systematically, leveraging these assets globally in these markets, putting the footprint just what is needed because it is not -- while it’s B2B but it is needing our contact with the clinics and all that. So we will be deep into these markets understanding how exactly each of these clinics sort of operate on this area. 
And hence it is significant involvement focus which will be a result, I guess in next two to three years.
Nitin Agarwal
Okay, so you think it is going to be tough couple of years before it starts to show meaningfully in numbers?
GV Prasad
Well yeah true but we will start seeing something even this year itself. Meaningful meaning what is meaningful, for us even 5 million to 10 million is meaningful, we can get going. 
Nitin Agarwal
Okay, and secondly on the distribution angle -- distribution consolidation, which is angle, was your experience, I mean sense on that part of the business, obviously the price erosion and the business combination of the asset or erosion because of competition. But if you were to see -- if there’s a way to sort of dissect that, so what is the distribution consolidation driven price erosion which is probably a little more sustainable normal going forward or any assessment?
GV Prasad
Not sure I understood your question. You are aware of the consolidation there are three players, right.
Nitin Agarwal
Right.
GV Prasad
Clarus, Redoc [ph] and [indiscernible] combination. So what's the specific question?

Nitin Agarwal
Sir I'm saying, we have had erosion in the business on account of compression in our key assets as well as pressure which is brought about by the consolidation, the distribution consolidation. So is there a way to sort of segregate the two in terms of the erosion which has been brought about by the consolidation process, or what and how do you see that playing forward?
GV Prasad
It's very difficult to answer your question in terms of numbers, because it's very asset specific. It depends on the number of competitors for the given asset and so on and so forth. But it feels very difficult to give a general answer. But it's a fact that price erosion is higher than what it used to be because of the high yields concentration of market shares among these three players. So somebody -- anybody who has his market shares will hang on to it for a long time and to dislodge that you need a bigger discount and that is where this price erosion is coming from.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Yeah.
Nitin Agarwal
Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Shyam Srinivasan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Shyam Srinivasan
Hi, yeah, thank you for taking my question. The first is on Aloxi, is there any update on the launch of this product?
Abhijit Mukherjee
The 505(b)(2), I think we have challenged the lower court decision. So that's one aspect, but the more happening one today is the [indiscernible] we achieve one which is being fought by one company and few of us -- couple of ourselves watching that closely. There I think the innovators have asked for hearing and the generic company is responding to it. So in summary, I think the verdict on that we would see in give-or-take, eight weeks -- within eight weeks, or around eight weeks from now, positive then it moves ahead negative then goes into a hearing which is a little long term, maybe another seven, eight months.
Shyam Srinivasan
So and your settlement with the innovator lets you launch with the generic company with Teva perhaps, if all goes well?
Abhijit Mukherjee
You make your own -- you are tracking it closely, so I couldn't -- have your guess.
Shyam Srinivasan
Okay. Sure thank you. My second question is on the new FDA commissioner, not new anymore, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's talking about more generics being on the market and priority reviews for the first generic on the market. So there has been a lot of talk but have you seen any walking the talk kind of a thing. So do you foresee more complex generic approvals or limited competition approvals in the next six to 12 months?
Abhijit Mukherjee
Look I think firstly, it's difficult to sort of expect rapid action, we are very excited about his comments and think very, very forward looking in the right direction and I think we will come there a lot. And so he's talking about few really sort of apt and relevant issues and so let see one, the positive change which has come in as in terms of prioritized expedited review. Earlier was just one generic -- it's been increased till three generics are approved. So quite a few SSR coming into expedited which is a good move. And then the rest we'll see as it unfolds actually, but overall comments are in absolutely right direction.
Shyam Srinivasan
Okay. Thank you. And my last question is on your R&D, what levels should we be assuming for the rest of the year, 15% first quarter and where is the incremental kind of R&D going into, is it going into mechanical trails, if you can get any color that will be useful? Thank you.
Saumen Chakraborty
Instead of taking as a percentage because the sales [indiscernible] there is a wide fluctuate in the percentage changes tremendously, I think we should take R&D will be in the vicinity of 500 crores per quarter, take 10, 20 crores plus/minus.

Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from the line Alok Dalal from CLSA. Please go ahead.
Alok Dalal
Hi good evening guys. Just one question. Mr. Prasad, how do you measure R&D productivity in the company, and how has it progressed over the last few years, has it declined, has it gone up? Thank you.
GV Prasad
We look at the NPV of assets. We look at the money we spend and NPV of pipeline that we deliver. There has been some fluctuation in the last two three years. It can’t be a very smooth year-on-year growth, last years has been a good year, we hope to continue that this year too. So the number themselves, number of filings while we are not as high as some of our competitors we believe the kind of assets we have justify the productivity of the assets. 
So we have complex assets and then we have simple assets, we have the blend for - difficult to have a number beyond our NPV number that we calculate internally. 
Alok Dalal
Yes, this is helpful. So when do you expect the R&D to get monetized, because the problem is that the R&D spend is hitting your P&L but the assets have not yet come maybe for multiple reasons. So when do you think whatever you spent on R&D so far is the two three year cycle or is it beyond that. 
GV Prasad
I think in the next two three years we should see significant growth in the company that I am not the R&D investments that we made.
Alok Dalal
So, just going back in time, you had a vision of $3 billion by FY 2013 do you think you will realize that in the next three years. 
GV Prasad
We hope so.
Abhijit Mukherjee
We may even more.
Alok Dalal
Okay, thank you sir.
Operator
Thank you. Due to time constraints, we will take the last question from the line of Anmol Ganjoo from JM Financial. Please go ahead.
Anmol Ganjoo
Hi, thanks for taking my question. my first question is to Mr. Prasad, Mr. Prasad you spoke about this initiatives around costs. I know it's too early to get into details, but as you embark on your initiative to perch costs what are the strategic areas, what are the areas which you think are non-focus non-strategic and what will come under your cross - first as you move to perch costs?
Abhijit Mukherjee
So we are not looking at divesting or cutting any businesses. So the businesses won’t get impacted, that there is significant amount of inefficiencies due to the way this grown over the years and we have never test back and looked at our network where we are spending what we are getting out of them and we didn’t have exercise frequently and we found significant scope for tightening everywhere without impacting outcomes.
And we believe that we can achieve that in next two to three years a very significant saving over our operating base.
Anmol Ganjoo
Okay, thanks, that’s helpful. My second question is that you spoke about whatever approvals you have gotten this quarter, they peak only in subsequent couple of quarters. If you look at this quarter the impact of the scale up of the market shares thus far how far would be with respect to just these three assets from our peaks this quarter contains an impact to what 40% of peak, 50% of peak, if you can just help us understand that that will be helpful.
Abhijit Mukherjee
You are talking about new launches.
Anmol Ganjoo
Yes, yes, so you said --
Abhijit Mukherjee
New launches is small ocean I mean first quarter it doesn’t make very big impact I mean it's not zero but it's not that significant number. 
Anmol Ganjoo
No that’s not what I meant, what I mean was that in terms of the peak sales potential of these three launches, how far we are 40%?
Abhijit Mukherjee
So in Q2 let’s not talk of Q1 Q2 I think these are two major assets I think we would almost get there like what - still those Q3 slightly, still to Q3 but by Q2 these assets will the run rates we should get.

Anmol Ganjoo
Okay. 
GV Prasad
Almost there like - being an traditional assets and sometimes its channel loading so they takes a little bit time but our market share of these asset is very good and so I think it will scale up by certainly by end Q2 to early Q3.
Abhijit Mukherjee
Expected…
Anmol Ganjoo
And my last question is if I may that you sounded optimistic that we will be restocking fairly soon and as far as India is concerned if we look at a full year basis I know it’s early but what’s your assessment that on a full year basis what is the prognosis of Indian market this year, is the lost sales for this quarter going to be compensated in subsequent quarters and to that extent do you think GST is a neutral event from an India grow of trajectory standpoint or what are your thoughts that…
Abhijit Mukherjee
Okay let me try and answer this little early at the moment but right now as we have seen the momentum coming back in July and I think we are reasonably satisfied so given that I'm not sure this would be a very significant behavior I mean in terms of India business let’s see how they come in force and are still possible for growth to be in reasonable range and all, high single-digit, low double-digit that’s to think.
Anmol Ganjoo
Okay thank you. That was my last question thank you.
Operator 
Thank you ladies and gentlemen due to time constraints that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Saunak Savla for closing comments.
Saunak Savla
Thank you all for joining the call and in case if you have any additional clarifications please feel free to get in touch with me in Investor Relations. Thank you.

DR. Reddys Lab (NYSE:RDY)Intraday Stock Chart
Today : Friday 28 July 2017



      Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. (BSE: 500124, NSE: DRREDDY, NYSE: RDY) and 
      CHD Bioscience Inc., a privately-held biopharmaceutical company, today 
      announced a global licensing agreement for the clinical development and 
      commercialization of Dr. Reddy’s Phase III clinical trial candidate, 
      DFA-02. It is intended to be used for the prevention of surgical site 
      infections, following non-emergency, elective colorectal surgery. Phase 
      II studies for DFA-02 have been successfully completed, and the product 
      will be transitioning to pivotal Phase III registration studies.
    

      Under the terms of the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s would receive equity in 
      CHD valued at $30 million upon an IPO of CHD or a minimum of $30 million 
      in cash within 18 months of execution of the agreement. Dr. Reddy’s will 
      also receive additional milestone payments of $40 million upon USFDA 
      approval. In addition, CHD will pay Dr. Reddy’s double-digit royalties 
      on sales and commercial milestones.
    

      Commenting on the signing of the agreement, Anil Namboodiripad, Ph.D., 
      Senior Vice President, Proprietary Products, and President, Promius 
      Pharma, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dr. Reddy’s, said, “We are pleased 
      to announce our partnership with CHD Bioscience. We feel that the needs 
      of patients undergoing surgery will be well served by CHD, given their 
      strong focus on offering targeted solutions for surgical site 
      infections. DFA-02 has demonstrated promising results in clinical 
      studies, and we are excited about the prospect of CHD undertaking 
      further development and commercialization of the asset.”
    

      “This transaction advances our strategy to become a world leader in the 
      targeted prevention and treatment of drug-resistant infections. Building 
      on our development work with VERIOX™ in orthopedics and wound 
      care, DFA-02 potentially extends our ability to help patients in the 
      surgical setting who may be at high risk of infections without exposing 
      the patient to large amounts of systemic antibiotics,” said Michael 
      Handley, director and chief executive officer of CHD Bioscience. “DFA-02 
      fits our strategy of targeting the site of the infection rather than the 
      whole patient, and we are pleased to be continuing the great work that 
      Dr. Reddy’s has started.”
    

About DFA-02


      DFA-02, Gentamicin and Vancomycin Sterile Gel for surgical wound 
      administration, is a novel bioresorbable extended release 
      phospholipid-based gel intended to be applied within the surgical 
      incision at the time of closure to potentially reduce the risk of 
      surgical site infection (SSI). The gentamicin component is intended to 
      provide coverage for Gram-negative organisms and the vancomycin 
      component is intended to provide coverage for Gram-positive organisms. 
      Further, the gel is intended to provide a high concentration of 
      gentamicin and vancomycin locally at the surgical site with limited 
      systemic exposure.
    

      In preclinical studies, DFA-02 has demonstrated promising properties. 
      Pharmacokinetics in these preclinical studies have demonstrated high 
      local tissue concentrations (greater than four times the minimum 
      inhibitory concentration [MIC] for sensitive organisms) and systemic 
      concentrations at or below recommended levels after use during closure 
      of surgical incisions. Preclinical models have also demonstrated 
      efficacy in reducing infection in surgical incisions as measured by 
      bacterial counts. No adverse histopathological findings or evidence of 
      interference in wound healing were observed.
    

      Clinically, two human studies have been completed in abdominal surgery. 
      No safety or tolerability concerns were observed and systemic gentamicin 
      and vancomycin levels were within acceptable limits. Further, on post 
      hoc analysis, DFA-02 demonstrated a statistically (p = 0.05) significant 
      reduction (60%) in surgical site infections in inflammatory bowel 
      disease patients receiving the treatment over patients in the control 
      arm receiving standard of care.

About CHD Bioscience: CHD Bioscience, Inc. is a Colorado and New 
      York-based biopharmaceutical company, creating a new paradigm of 
      antimicrobial therapy. Our approach is to provide localized targeted 
      antimicrobial delivery at higher concentrations than can be achieved 
      with intravenous or oral delivery and thus potentially increase the 
      efficacy of the therapy as well as increasing the safety. . 
      Specifically, we believe intravenous and oral delivery of antimicrobial 
      therapies should be the exception not the rule when treating infections. 
      The majority of infections are localized/confined infections that 
      systemic therapy has difficulty reaching at reasonable concentrations to 
      provide reliable efficacious outcomes. Furthermore, systemic therapy can 
      have undesirable side effects in terms of potentiation of 
      hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and elimination of the beneficial 
      microbiome that provide improved immunity and resistance against 
      opportunistic infections from bad microbes. CHD is developing a pipeline 
      of products that overcome the issues involved with systemic 
      antimicrobial therapy and establishing ourselves as the global leader in 
      this market. Our first products to market will use our patented VERIOX™ 
      chemistry that has demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy profiles 
      in pre-clinical testing. We plan to initially launch product in the 
      orthopedic and wound care markets using products that contain VERIOX™ 
      chemistry. For more information, visit http://www.chdbioscience.com/

Dr.Reddy’s in India

Dr. Reddy’s commenced its generics business in India in 1986 and is today a trusted name in the healthcare industry consistently serving the needs of millions of patients with high quality, affordable and innovative medicines across therapy areas.
Portfolio spanning wide range of therapy and disease areas
Over the years, the company has significantly grown its portfolio of products across mass and specialty therapies. Today, our portfolio has over 200 products covering the whole spectrum of disease areas spanning gastroenterology, oncology, pain management, cardiovascular, dermatology, urology, nephrology, rheumatology and diabetes. Seven of our brands are listed in “Top-300 of the Indian Pharma Market” and many others hold leadership positions in their respective categories.
Ensuring that medicines are available when needed
Dr. Reddy’s has built a robust field force driven by the zeal to make a difference in the lives of patients. The 5000-member strong team network connects with more than three lakh doctors on a regular basis to ensure that quality medicines we make are available for patients across the length and breadth of the country. Their efforts are backed by our unique inventory management system, VIVA (Viable Vision), to ensure that the medicines are available for patients when they need it.
Going beyond the pill to address patient needs
As a company we have progressively transitioned from being a maker of molecules to a provider of medicines. Along the way we developed a deeper empathy for the needs of patients and their caregivers. This has impelled Dr. Reddy’s as an organization to go beyond medicines and leverage our capabilities to meet some of these unmet patient needs. Our Purple Health initiative in India aims at taking patient care beyond the pill focusing our efforts in four areas:

Disease awareness and convenient diagnosis
Access to medicines
Better therapy experience
Adherence to therapy
