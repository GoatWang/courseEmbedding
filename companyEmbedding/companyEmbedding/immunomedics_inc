LeukoScan® (sulesomab) is a murine monoclonal 
                            IgG antibody Fab’ fragment labeled with the 
                            isotope technetium-99m. The fragment targets NCA-90, 
                            found on the cell membrane of granulocytes (a type 
                            of white blood cell). Using a gamma camera, LeukoScan®
                            can be used to detect osteomyelitis (a bone infection). 
                            LeukoScan® is not available in North America, but it 
                            has European-wide registration and it is also approved 
                            in Australia.

ImmuSTRIP® is an ELISA method immunoassay 
                            laboratory test kit used to detect Human Anti-Murine 
                            Antibodies (HAMA). Using this kit, clinicians can 
                            determine if their patients have preexisting HAMA 
                            or have developed HAMA due to recent treatments with 
                            murine monoclonal antibodies. ImmuSTRIP® is a simple 
                            to use test kit that provides results in as little 
                            as one hour and is available for use by reference 
                  laboratories.

Early-Stage Pipeline





Early-Stage Pipeline
We have additional potential products for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases, including veltuzumab, our anti-CD20 antibody, and milatuzumab, our anti-CD74 antibody. The latter has received a Department of Defense grant for a clinical study in patients with lupus. Other programs include IMMU-114, a humanized anti-HLA-DR antibody being investigated as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed NHL and CLL. 



 Veltuzumab
Background
Veltuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 receptors on B lymphocytes currently under development for the treatment of NHL and autoimmune diseases.
In autoimmune diseases, we are studying the subcutaneous formulation of veltuzumab in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), in a Phase 1/2 trial. This trial, designed to evaluate different dosing schedules, has completed patient accrual and patients are being followed for up to 5 years. On July 28, 2015 the Office of Orphan Products Development of FDA granted orphan status for the use of veltuzumab for the treatment of ITP.
In oncology, a NCI-funded Phase 1/2 study in patients with aggressive NHL in combination with 90Y-epratuzumab tetraxetan has completed patient enrollment, with patient follow-up continuing. 
We are currently evaluating various options for further clinical development of veltuzumab in ITP and other autoimmune disease indications, including pemphigus, as well as in oncology, including licensing arrangements and collaborations with outside study groups.
Clinical Studies
ITP
 The Phase I/II trial in adult patients with chronic ITP has completed patient enrollment. For more information on this clinical trial, please go to clinicaltrials.gov.
Aggressive NHL
The National Cancer Institute is funding a Phase I/II study combining veltuzumab with yttrium-90-labeled epratuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory, aggressive NHL.

Milatuzumab
Background
 Milatuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting tumors that express the CD74 antigen, which is present on a variety of hematological tumors and even on some solid cancers, with restricted expression by normal tissues. It has received orphan drug designation from the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma or CLL. Milatuzumab is the first anti-CD74 antibody that has entered into human testing and we have completed initial Phase I studies in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, NHL or CLL. 
The anti-CD74 antibody is also being studied subcutaneously in a Phase 1b study in patients with active SLE. The SLE study is supported by a three-year research grant from the Department of Defense with a potential funding of $1.6 million.
Our interest in pursuing milatuzumab in immune diseases is driven by the observations that implicated CD74 in antigen presentation—particularly by dendritic and other immune cells—and as a survival factor for rapidly proliferating malignant cells. Recent findings have determined that CD74 is a receptor for the pro-inflammatory chemokine, macrophage migration-inhibitory factor, and that binding of the factor to CD74 initiates a signaling cascade resulting in proliferation and survival of normal and malignant B cells, such as in CLL. Migration-inhibitory factor is widely expressed by immune cells, particularly macrophages, and is known to play a role in autoimmune disease. Thus, we believe that milatuzumab, by blocking the function of CD74, could be useful in the management of immune diseases either alone or in combination with other agents—including other B-cell antibodies such as epratuzumab and veltuzumab.

Clinical Studies
Lupus (SLE)
This is a Phase Ib study of milatuzumab administered subcutaneously in patients with active SLE  funded by a grant from the Department of Defense.

IMMU-114
Background
IMMU-114 is a novel humanized antibody directed against an immune response target, HLA-DR, for the treatment of patients with B-cell cancers. HLA-DR is a receptor located on the cell surface whose role is to present foreign objects to the immune system for the purpose of eliciting an immune response. Increased presence of HLA-DR in hematologic cancers has made it a prime target for antibody therapy.
Although other anti-HLA-DR antibodies have been developed, IMMU-114 is distinguished by having a different immunoglobulin class, IgG4, which does not function by the usual effector-cell activities of antibodies, such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). As a result, IMMU-114 does not rely on an intact immune system in the patient to kill tumor cells. Furthermore, because ADCC and CDC are believed to play a major role in causing the side effects of antibody therapy, we expect IMMU-114 to be less toxic to patients.
By targeting HLA-DR, a receptor that is different from the antigen targeted by rituximab or other antibodies in development for NHL and other B-cell malignancies, IMMU-114 may represent a new tool in the arsenal to combat these cancers.

Clinical Studies
NHL/CLL
The anti-HLA-DR antibody is being investigated in a Phase I dose-escalation study as a monotherapy for patients with  NHL or CLL.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
