History[edit]
Background (CEGB before 1990)[edit]
See also: Central Electricity Generating Board § Responsibilities
Before 1990, both the generation and transmission activities in England and Wales were under the responsibility of Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). The present electricity market in the United Kingdom was built upon the breakup of the CEGB into four separate companies in the 1990s.[4]
Its generation (or upstream) activities were transferred to three generating companies—PowerGen, National Power, and Nuclear Electric (later British Energy, eventually EDF Energy)—and its transmission (or downstream) activities to the National Grid Company.[5]
National Grid and acquisitions (1990-1999)[edit]
In 1990, the transmission activities of the CEGB were transferred to the National Grid Company plc, which was owned by the twelve regional electricity companies (RECs) through a holding company, National Grid Group plc. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1995.[6]
Expansion and consolidation (2000-present)[edit]
With the beginning of the new millennium, National Grid pursued some major mergers and acquisitions. In 2000, National Grid Group acquired New England Electric System and Eastern Utilities Associates.[7] In January 2002, National Grid Group acquired Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, a New York State utility.[8]
In October 2002, National Grid Group merged with Lattice Group plc, owner of Transco—the gas distribution business (Lattice demerged from BG Group in 2000).[9] National Grid Group changed its name to National Grid Transco plc.[10] In August 2004, National Grid Transco agreed to sell four of its regional gas distribution networks. The total cash consideration was £5.8 billion. NGT kept ownership of other four distribution networks, which comprise almost half of Great Britain's gas distribution network.[9] In July 2005, National Grid Transco was renamed National Grid plc. On 26 July 2005, National Grid Company was renamed National Grid Electricity Transmission plc, and on 10 October 2005, Transco was renamed National Grid Gas plc.[10]
In February 2006, National Grid announced that it had agreed to buy KeySpan Corporation,[11] a gas distributor and electricity producer in the United States, for $7.3bn (£4.1bn) in cash. Around the same time, National Grid also announced the acquisition of the Southern Union Company subsidiary, New England Gas Company in Rhode Island.[12] The acquisitions of the two natural gas delivery companies materially doubled the size of National Grid's American subsidiary, creating the second largest utility in the United States with more than 8 million customers. The acquisition of KeySpan was completed on 24 August 2007 following government and regulatory approval and endorsement by the shareholders of the two companies.[13]
In May 2007, National Grid formed a joint venture with the Dutch transmission operator TenneT for a 260-kilometre (160 mi) 1,000 MW BritNed DC link between the Isle of Grain in Kent and Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam.[14][15] The installation of the first section of cable link started on 11 September 2009,[16] whilst the entire 260 km (160 mi) cable was completed in October 2010.[17] The interconnection became operational on 1 April 2011,[18][19] and by January 2012, electricity flow had mostly been from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom.[20] The BritNed interconnection would serve as a vital link for the foreseeable European super grid project.[21]
In spring 2011, National Grid sold off its services in New Hampshire, after their request to increase gas and electric rates was denied.[22]
In November 2015, it was announced that Steve Holliday, the CEO for ten years, would leave in March 2016 and that John Pettigrew, its executive director who joined National Grid 25 years ago, would succeed him.[23] In June 2016, the Energy Select Committee argued that the company faced too many conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to its ownership of international interconnectors. The committee proposed that the company should be split up.[24]
In December 2016, National Grid agreed to sell a 61% stake in its gas distribution business, to a consortium of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, Allianz Capital Partners, Hermes Investment Management, CIC Capital Corporation, Qatar Investment Authority, Dalmore Capital and Amber Infrastructure Limited, with a further 14% stake under negotiation. The sale is due to be completed by 31 March 2017, subject to clearance by the European Commission.[25]
Operations[edit]

United Kingdom[edit]

National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (formerly National Grid Company) owns and operates the National Grid high voltage electricity transmission network in England and Wales. Since 1 April 2005, it also operates the electricity transmission network in Scotland (although this is still owned by Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern Energy).[26]

National Grid plc part owns and operates a 2,000 Megawatt HVDC link to France (HVDC Cross-Channel) with RTE.
National Grid plc part owns and operates a 1,000 Megawatt HVDC link to the Netherlands (BritNed) with TenneT.
National Grid Gas plc (formerly Transco) owns and operates the gas transmission network (from terminals to distributors), known as the National Transmission System (NTS), and four distribution networks (from national network to customers): North West of England, East of England (which is split into two areas—East Anglia & East Midlands), West Midlands and London; the distribution networks were former regional divisions of British Gas.
As of 2012, the National Grid Property Portfolio was formed to house all RESP land, offices and depots used for National Grid operations that are now surplus to requirements or let to third parties



United States[edit]

National Grid United States operates over 9,000 miles (14,000 km) of electricity transmission and delivers electricity and natural gas to areas of the Northeast states of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island serving over 3.3 million customers with electrical power and 3.4 million customers with natural gas.[27] The business is currently headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts in a 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2) LEED certified "green" facility.[27] This subsidiary carries out its business through a number of subsidiary companies (all doing business as "National Grid"). The main ones are:[10]

New England Power Company;
Massachusetts Electric Company (in Massachusetts);
Nantucket Electric (in Massachusetts);
The Narragansett Electric Company (in Rhode Island);
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (in New York State);
KeySpan Corporation (parts of New York City);
Boston Gas Company (including the former Essex Gas Company in Massachusetts); and
Colonial Gas Company (in Massachusetts)

History[edit]
Background (CEGB before 1990)[edit]
See also: Central Electricity Generating Board § Responsibilities
Before 1990, both the generation and transmission activities in England and Wales were under the responsibility of Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). The present electricity market in the United Kingdom was built upon the breakup of the CEGB into four separate companies in the 1990s.[4]
Its generation (or upstream) activities were transferred to three generating companies—PowerGen, National Power, and Nuclear Electric (later British Energy, eventually EDF Energy)—and its transmission (or downstream) activities to the National Grid Company.[5]
National Grid and acquisitions (1990-1999)[edit]
In 1990, the transmission activities of the CEGB were transferred to the National Grid Company plc, which was owned by the twelve regional electricity companies (RECs) through a holding company, National Grid Group plc. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1995.[6]
Expansion and consolidation (2000-present)[edit]
With the beginning of the new millennium, National Grid pursued some major mergers and acquisitions. In 2000, National Grid Group acquired New England Electric System and Eastern Utilities Associates.[7] In January 2002, National Grid Group acquired Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, a New York State utility.[8]
In October 2002, National Grid Group merged with Lattice Group plc, owner of Transco—the gas distribution business (Lattice demerged from BG Group in 2000).[9] National Grid Group changed its name to National Grid Transco plc.[10] In August 2004, National Grid Transco agreed to sell four of its regional gas distribution networks. The total cash consideration was £5.8 billion. NGT kept ownership of other four distribution networks, which comprise almost half of Great Britain's gas distribution network.[9] In July 2005, National Grid Transco was renamed National Grid plc. On 26 July 2005, National Grid Company was renamed National Grid Electricity Transmission plc, and on 10 October 2005, Transco was renamed National Grid Gas plc.[10]
In February 2006, National Grid announced that it had agreed to buy KeySpan Corporation,[11] a gas distributor and electricity producer in the United States, for $7.3bn (£4.1bn) in cash. Around the same time, National Grid also announced the acquisition of the Southern Union Company subsidiary, New England Gas Company in Rhode Island.[12] The acquisitions of the two natural gas delivery companies materially doubled the size of National Grid's American subsidiary, creating the second largest utility in the United States with more than 8 million customers. The acquisition of KeySpan was completed on 24 August 2007 following government and regulatory approval and endorsement by the shareholders of the two companies.[13]
In May 2007, National Grid formed a joint venture with the Dutch transmission operator TenneT for a 260-kilometre (160 mi) 1,000 MW BritNed DC link between the Isle of Grain in Kent and Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam.[14][15] The installation of the first section of cable link started on 11 September 2009,[16] whilst the entire 260 km (160 mi) cable was completed in October 2010.[17] The interconnection became operational on 1 April 2011,[18][19] and by January 2012, electricity flow had mostly been from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom.[20] The BritNed interconnection would serve as a vital link for the foreseeable European super grid project.[21]
In spring 2011, National Grid sold off its services in New Hampshire, after their request to increase gas and electric rates was denied.[22]
In November 2015, it was announced that Steve Holliday, the CEO for ten years, would leave in March 2016 and that John Pettigrew, its executive director who joined National Grid 25 years ago, would succeed him.[23] In June 2016, the Energy Select Committee argued that the company faced too many conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to its ownership of international interconnectors. The committee proposed that the company should be split up.[24]
In December 2016, National Grid agreed to sell a 61% stake in its gas distribution business, to a consortium of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, Allianz Capital Partners, Hermes Investment Management, CIC Capital Corporation, Qatar Investment Authority, Dalmore Capital and Amber Infrastructure Limited, with a further 14% stake under negotiation. The sale is due to be completed by 31 March 2017, subject to clearance by the European Commission.[25]

Founded in 1990, National Grid plc and its subsidiaries transmit and distribute electricity and gas in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the UK, they own and operate high voltage electricity transmission networks, the electricity interconnector between England and France, liquefied natural gas storage facilities, and four gas distribution networks.

Its Non-Regulated and Other businesses division's UK operations include metering services, property management, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) importation terminal on the Isle of Grain, and the construction and operation of an electricity interconnector between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

IT operations are run by a Global CIO out of IT headquarters in Warwick, UK. IT's primary focus is on monitoring the distribution and pricing of both electricity and gas. 

Global managers and department heads report to the CIO and are responsible for Global Projects, Risk & Security, Strategy and Architecture, Global IT Corporate Business Relationships, Network Operations, and Network Strategy.

The Solihull office houses telecom management and IT managers focused on developing and implementing project strategies.

This office shares a building and a telephone switchboard with Xoserve, an independent Natural Grid spin-off corporation, which is the supply point administrator of Great Britain's open electricity market. OnStream, a wholly owned metering service subsidiary of National Grid, is also located here.

A large portion of IT management and support is outsourced to Computer Sciences Corporation. CSC works with National Grid's mainframes, applications, desktop, and telecommunication services supporting more than 18,000 National Grid users. National Grid's "internal" IT help desk is also run by CSC.

In April, 2011, National Grid plc signed a seven-year service agreement with HP Enterprise Services UK, in which HP will provide a solution that helps manage National Grid's hybrid technology environment and increase response rates to market changes. 

National Grid's US operations are profiled separately.

History[edit]
Background (CEGB before 1990)[edit]
See also: Central Electricity Generating Board § Responsibilities
Before 1990, both the generation and transmission activities in England and Wales were under the responsibility of Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). The present electricity market in the United Kingdom was built upon the breakup of the CEGB into four separate companies in the 1990s.[4]
Its generation (or upstream) activities were transferred to three generating companies—PowerGen, National Power, and Nuclear Electric (later British Energy, eventually EDF Energy)—and its transmission (or downstream) activities to the National Grid Company.[5]
National Grid and acquisitions (1990-1999)[edit]
In 1990, the transmission activities of the CEGB were transferred to the National Grid Company plc, which was owned by the twelve regional electricity companies (RECs) through a holding company, National Grid Group plc. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1995.[6]
Expansion and consolidation (2000-present)[edit]
With the beginning of the new millennium, National Grid pursued some major mergers and acquisitions. In 2000, National Grid Group acquired New England Electric System and Eastern Utilities Associates.[7] In January 2002, National Grid Group acquired Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, a New York State utility.[8]
In October 2002, National Grid Group merged with Lattice Group plc, owner of Transco—the gas distribution business (Lattice demerged from BG Group in 2000).[9] National Grid Group changed its name to National Grid Transco plc.[10] In August 2004, National Grid Transco agreed to sell four of its regional gas distribution networks. The total cash consideration was £5.8 billion. NGT kept ownership of other four distribution networks, which comprise almost half of Great Britain's gas distribution network.[9] In July 2005, National Grid Transco was renamed National Grid plc. On 26 July 2005, National Grid Company was renamed National Grid Electricity Transmission plc, and on 10 October 2005, Transco was renamed National Grid Gas plc.[10]
In February 2006, National Grid announced that it had agreed to buy KeySpan Corporation,[11] a gas distributor and electricity producer in the United States, for $7.3bn (£4.1bn) in cash. Around the same time, National Grid also announced the acquisition of the Southern Union Company subsidiary, New England Gas Company in Rhode Island.[12] The acquisitions of the two natural gas delivery companies materially doubled the size of National Grid's American subsidiary, creating the second largest utility in the United States with more than 8 million customers. The acquisition of KeySpan was completed on 24 August 2007 following government and regulatory approval and endorsement by the shareholders of the two companies.[13]
In May 2007, National Grid formed a joint venture with the Dutch transmission operator TenneT for a 260-kilometre (160 mi) 1,000 MW BritNed DC link between the Isle of Grain in Kent and Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam.[14][15] The installation of the first section of cable link started on 11 September 2009,[16] whilst the entire 260 km (160 mi) cable was completed in October 2010.[17] The interconnection became operational on 1 April 2011,[18][19] and by January 2012, electricity flow had mostly been from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom.[20] The BritNed interconnection would serve as a vital link for the foreseeable European super grid project.[21]
In spring 2011, National Grid sold off its services in New Hampshire, after their request to increase gas and electric rates was denied.[22]
In November 2015, it was announced that Steve Holliday, the CEO for ten years, would leave in March 2016 and that John Pettigrew, its executive director who joined National Grid 25 years ago, would succeed him.[23] In June 2016, the Energy Select Committee argued that the company faced too many conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to its ownership of international interconnectors. The committee proposed that the company should be split up.[24]
In December 2016, National Grid agreed to sell a 61% stake in its gas distribution business, to a consortium of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, Allianz Capital Partners, Hermes Investment Management, CIC Capital Corporation, Qatar Investment Authority, Dalmore Capital and Amber Infrastructure Limited, with a further 14% stake under negotiation. The sale is due to be completed by 31 March 2017, subject to clearance by the European Commission.[25]
Operations[edit]

United Kingdom[edit]

National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (formerly National Grid Company) owns and operates the National Grid high voltage electricity transmission network in England and Wales. Since 1 April 2005, it also operates the electricity transmission network in Scotland (although this is still owned by Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern Energy).[26]

National Grid plc part owns and operates a 2,000 Megawatt HVDC link to France (HVDC Cross-Channel) with RTE.
National Grid plc part owns and operates a 1,000 Megawatt HVDC link to the Netherlands (BritNed) with TenneT.
National Grid Gas plc (formerly Transco) owns and operates the gas transmission network (from terminals to distributors), known as the National Transmission System (NTS), and four distribution networks (from national network to customers): North West of England, East of England (which is split into two areas—East Anglia & East Midlands), West Midlands and London; the distribution networks were former regional divisions of British Gas.
As of 2012, the National Grid Property Portfolio was formed to house all RESP land, offices and depots used for National Grid operations that are now surplus to requirements or let to third parties



United States[edit]

National Grid United States operates over 9,000 miles (14,000 km) of electricity transmission and delivers electricity and natural gas to areas of the Northeast states of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island serving over 3.3 million customers with electrical power and 3.4 million customers with natural gas.[27] The business is currently headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts in a 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2) LEED certified "green" facility.[27] This subsidiary carries out its business through a number of subsidiary companies (all doing business as "National Grid"). The main ones are:[10]

New England Power Company;
Massachusetts Electric Company (in Massachusetts);
Nantucket Electric (in Massachusetts);
The Narragansett Electric Company (in Rhode Island);
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (in New York State);
KeySpan Corporation (parts of New York City);
Boston Gas Company (including the former Essex Gas Company in Massachusetts); and
Colonial Gas Company (in Massachusetts)

History[edit]
Background (CEGB before 1990)[edit]
See also: Central Electricity Generating Board § Responsibilities
Before 1990, both the generation and transmission activities in England and Wales were under the responsibility of Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). The present electricity market in the United Kingdom was built upon the breakup of the CEGB into four separate companies in the 1990s.[4]
Its generation (or upstream) activities were transferred to three generating companies—PowerGen, National Power, and Nuclear Electric (later British Energy, eventually EDF Energy)—and its transmission (or downstream) activities to the National Grid Company.[5]
National Grid and acquisitions (1990-1999)[edit]
In 1990, the transmission activities of the CEGB were transferred to the National Grid Company plc, which was owned by the twelve regional electricity companies (RECs) through a holding company, National Grid Group plc. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1995.[6]
Expansion and consolidation (2000-present)[edit]
With the beginning of the new millennium, National Grid pursued some major mergers and acquisitions. In 2000, National Grid Group acquired New England Electric System and Eastern Utilities Associates.[7] In January 2002, National Grid Group acquired Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, a New York State utility.[8]
In October 2002, National Grid Group merged with Lattice Group plc, owner of Transco—the gas distribution business (Lattice demerged from BG Group in 2000).[9] National Grid Group changed its name to National Grid Transco plc.[10] In August 2004, National Grid Transco agreed to sell four of its regional gas distribution networks. The total cash consideration was £5.8 billion. NGT kept ownership of other four distribution networks, which comprise almost half of Great Britain's gas distribution network.[9] In July 2005, National Grid Transco was renamed National Grid plc. On 26 July 2005, National Grid Company was renamed National Grid Electricity Transmission plc, and on 10 October 2005, Transco was renamed National Grid Gas plc.[10]
In February 2006, National Grid announced that it had agreed to buy KeySpan Corporation,[11] a gas distributor and electricity producer in the United States, for $7.3bn (£4.1bn) in cash. Around the same time, National Grid also announced the acquisition of the Southern Union Company subsidiary, New England Gas Company in Rhode Island.[12] The acquisitions of the two natural gas delivery companies materially doubled the size of National Grid's American subsidiary, creating the second largest utility in the United States with more than 8 million customers. The acquisition of KeySpan was completed on 24 August 2007 following government and regulatory approval and endorsement by the shareholders of the two companies.[13]
In May 2007, National Grid formed a joint venture with the Dutch transmission operator TenneT for a 260-kilometre (160 mi) 1,000 MW BritNed DC link between the Isle of Grain in Kent and Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam.[14][15] The installation of the first section of cable link started on 11 September 2009,[16] whilst the entire 260 km (160 mi) cable was completed in October 2010.[17] The interconnection became operational on 1 April 2011,[18][19] and by January 2012, electricity flow had mostly been from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom.[20] The BritNed interconnection would serve as a vital link for the foreseeable European super grid project.[21]
In spring 2011, National Grid sold off its services in New Hampshire, after their request to increase gas and electric rates was denied.[22]
In November 2015, it was announced that Steve Holliday, the CEO for ten years, would leave in March 2016 and that John Pettigrew, its executive director who joined National Grid 25 years ago, would succeed him.[23] In June 2016, the Energy Select Committee argued that the company faced too many conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to its ownership of international interconnectors. The committee proposed that the company should be split up.[24]
In December 2016, National Grid agreed to sell a 61% stake in its gas distribution business, to a consortium of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, Allianz Capital Partners, Hermes Investment Management, CIC Capital Corporation, Qatar Investment Authority, Dalmore Capital and Amber Infrastructure Limited, with a further 14% stake under negotiation. The sale is due to be completed by 31 March 2017, subject to clearance by the European Commission.[25]
Operations[edit]

United Kingdom[edit]

National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (formerly National Grid Company) owns and operates the National Grid high voltage electricity transmission network in England and Wales. Since 1 April 2005, it also operates the electricity transmission network in Scotland (although this is still owned by Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern Energy).[26]

National Grid plc part owns and operates a 2,000 Megawatt HVDC link to France (HVDC Cross-Channel) with RTE.
National Grid plc part owns and operates a 1,000 Megawatt HVDC link to the Netherlands (BritNed) with TenneT.
National Grid Gas plc (formerly Transco) owns and operates the gas transmission network (from terminals to distributors), known as the National Transmission System (NTS), and four distribution networks (from national network to customers): North West of England, East of England (which is split into two areas—East Anglia & East Midlands), West Midlands and London; the distribution networks were former regional divisions of British Gas.
As of 2012, the National Grid Property Portfolio was formed to house all RESP land, offices and depots used for National Grid operations that are now surplus to requirements or let to third parties



United States[edit]

National Grid United States operates over 9,000 miles (14,000 km) of electricity transmission and delivers electricity and natural gas to areas of the Northeast states of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island serving over 3.3 million customers with electrical power and 3.4 million customers with natural gas.[27] The business is currently headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts in a 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2) LEED certified "green" facility.[27] This subsidiary carries out its business through a number of subsidiary companies (all doing business as "National Grid"). The main ones are:[10]

New England Power Company;
Massachusetts Electric Company (in Massachusetts);
Nantucket Electric (in Massachusetts);
The Narragansett Electric Company (in Rhode Island);
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (in New York State);
KeySpan Corporation (parts of New York City);

NGT kept ownership of other four distribution networks, which comprise almost half of Great Britain's gas distribution network.[9] In July 2005, National Grid Transco was renamed National Grid plc. On 26 July 2005, National Grid Company was renamed National Grid Electricity Transmission plc, and on 10 October 2005, Transco was renamed National Grid Gas plc.[10]
In February 2006, National Grid announced that it had agreed to buy KeySpan Corporation,[11] a gas distributor and electricity producer in the United States, for $7.3bn (£4.1bn) in cash. Around the same time, National Grid also announced the acquisition of the Southern Union Company subsidiary, New England Gas Company in Rhode Island.[12] The acquisitions of the two natural gas delivery companies materially doubled the size of National Grid's American subsidiary, creating the second largest utility in the United States with more than 8 million customers. The acquisition of KeySpan was completed on 24 August 2007 following government and regulatory approval and endorsement by the shareholders of the two companies.[13]
In May 2007, National Grid formed a joint venture with the Dutch transmission operator TenneT for a 260-kilometre (160 mi) 1,000 MW BritNed DC link between the Isle of Grain in Kent and Maasvlakte, near Rotterdam.[14][15] The installation of the first section of cable link started on 11 September 2009,[16] whilst the entire 260 km (160 mi) cable was completed in October 2010.[17] The interconnection became operational on 1 April 2011,[18][19] and by January 2012, electricity flow had mostly been from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom.[20] The BritNed interconnection would serve as a vital link for the foreseeable European super grid project.[21]
In spring 2011, National Grid sold off its services in New Hampshire, after their request to increase gas and electric rates was denied.[22]
In November 2015, it was announced that Steve Holliday, the CEO for ten years, would leave in March 2016 and that John Pettigrew, its executive director who joined National Grid 25 years ago, would succeed him.[23] In June 2016, the Energy Select Committee argued that the company faced too many conflicts of interest, particularly with regard to its ownership of international interconnectors. The committee proposed that the company should be split up.[24]
In December 2016, National Grid agreed to sell a 61% stake in its gas distribution business, to a consortium of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, Allianz Capital Partners, Hermes Investment Management, CIC Capital Corporation, Qatar Investment Authority, Dalmore Capital and Amber Infrastructure Limited, with a further 14% stake under negotiation. The sale is due to be completed by 31 March 2017, subject to clearance by the European Commission.[25]
Operations[edit]

United Kingdom[edit]

National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (formerly National Grid Company) owns and operates the National Grid high voltage electricity transmission network in England and Wales. Since 1 April 2005, it also operates the electricity transmission network in Scotland (although this is still owned by Scottish Power and Scottish & Southern Energy).[26]

National Grid plc part owns and operates a 2,000 Megawatt HVDC link to France (HVDC Cross-Channel) with RTE.
National Grid plc part owns and operates a 1,000 Megawatt HVDC link to the Netherlands (BritNed) with TenneT.
National Grid Gas plc (formerly Transco) owns and operates the gas transmission network (from terminals to distributors), known as the National Transmission System (NTS), and four distribution networks (from national network to customers): North West of England, East of England (which is split into two areas—East Anglia & East Midlands), West Midlands and London; the distribution networks were former regional divisions of British Gas.
As of 2012, the National Grid Property Portfolio was formed to house all RESP land, offices and depots used for National Grid operations that are now surplus to requirements or let to third parties



United States[edit]

National Grid United States operates over 9,000 miles (14,000 km) of electricity transmission and delivers electricity and natural gas to areas of the Northeast states of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island serving over 3.3 million customers with electrical power and 3.4 million customers with natural gas.[27] The business is currently headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts in a 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2) LEED certified "green" facility.[27] This subsidiary carries out its business through a number of subsidiary companies (all doing business as "National Grid"). The main ones are:[10]

New England Power Company;
Massachusetts Electric Company (in Massachusetts);
Nantucket Electric (in Massachusetts);
The Narragansett Electric Company (in Rhode Island);
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (in New York State);
KeySpan Corporation (parts of New York City);
Boston Gas Company (including the former Essex Gas Company in Massachusetts); and
Colonial Gas Company (in Massachusetts)

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
