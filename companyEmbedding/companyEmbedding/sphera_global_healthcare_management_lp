Our investment philosophy is based on the following criteria:

Our goal is to generate positive long-term returns that outperform the relevant equity benchmarks over time, with significantly lower volatility.



Emphasis on quality of management teams and in-depth research

Our investment strategy is implemented through  strong emphasis on the quality
						    of management teams of our portfolio investments as well as through extensive
						    research process of companies, industries and macro trends.





Strategic focus on risk management

We constantly utilize a variety of tools and techniques to reduce volatility and hedge the portfolio's
 risk exposure. Among the tools employed are shorts, options, futures, convertible debt and high-yield debt.
 We do not employ leverage in our portfolios.
 We dedicate considerable resources to developing close, ongoing dialogue with management teams of existing
 and prospective investments, and consider the quality and credibility of management teams to be a critical factor in our investment considerations and risk management.





Focus on growth and profitability

Sphera’s investment objective is to identify companies with strong fundamentals  that generate sustainable growth and profitability over time.









Sphera Fund

Sphera Fund is a long/short equity fund investing
				primarily in large cap Israeli equities trading in Israel,  US and European markets.
Our investment style is predicated on combining fundamental, bottoms-up research and analysis of portfolio
 companies with a variety of hedging strategies to reduce the fund’s market risk and volatility. The
 long-standing experience of our principals investing in Israeli & International companies provides
 us with a strong edge in identifying and accessing attractive investment opportunities in this particular
 universe of companies.



Sphera Global Healthcare Fund

Sphera Global Healthcare Management (Investment Manager) is a partnership between Mr. Mori Arkin, former vice chairman of Perrigo (Nasdaq ticker:PRGO, a world leader in generic and OTC drugs), and of Sphera Funds Management.







Strategy

Long/short equity fund that is focused on the global pharmaceutical and biotech industries. The Investment Manager’s objective is to generate consistent and attractive long term returns exceeding the industry while maintaining disciplined risk management.
							With a highly experienced and cohesive multidisciplinary team, the Fund’s competitive advantage is evident in three key areas:						
							• Having a rigorous, fundamental, focused and comprehensive approach to healthcare research.
							• Investment committee co- led by an industry veteran with a track record of building a pharmaceutical company.
							• Unique and unbiased investment approach generated in part from access to massive flow of R &D, innovation and top tier human capital in Israel.





Why Healthcare?

The opportunity is supported by three distinct developments that have occurred over the past few years: 
Elimination of patent cliffs  -  driven  by  the  domination  of  biological  drugs,  is  an industry game changer.

							Major R &D achievements - driven by breakthroughs in innovation.

Sphera Global Healthcare Management partner Ori Hershkowitz: The share price does not lie.



        
            "The situation at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) is not good and the share price does not lie," Sphera Global Healthcare Management LP managing partner Ori Hershkowitz told "Globes", the day after Erez Vigodman took up his post as president and CEO of the company. "Teva has a product that accounts for more than half of its profit, Copaxone, which is about to lose its patent, and other products that account for a large percentage of its profit and which will face generic competition by the end of the decade."  Hershkowitz adds, "Teva's working assumption is that 2014 will be a low year in profits, and that they will grow afterwards. The assumption relies on switching 30-50% of patients to three-times-a-week Copaxone. I agree with Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MNTA) (which is developing a generic version of Copaxone) that Teva's forecast for switching patients is too aggressive and overoptimistic." The more patients that Teva is able to switch to three-times-a-week Copaxone, the milder will be the reaction of Teva's share price to the launch of generic Copaxone, says Hershkowitz. "If they succeed in switching 20% of patients, the approval of generic Copaxone will send the share price down by over 10%," he estimates.

Vigodman is right medicine for Teva








Hershkowitz is not enthusiastic about Teva's new therapeutic entities (NTE) plan, either. "I do not think that they will generate enough growth," he says. "I estimate that more than half of the NTEs will never reach market, and of those that do make, only 5-10% will have more than $100 million in sales." The NTEs are part of the strategy introduced by former Teva CEO Jeremy Levin. "Levin is one of the smartest men in the pharmaceuticals industry. I was optimistic when he was appointed, and I was very wrong," says Hershkowitz. "Levin brought in a clique of middle managers who joined the existing middle managers, and introduced a strategy that is divorced from reality and does not meet the logic of the pharmaceutical industry. Did the board of directors force this strategy on him, or did Levin choose it himself? I think that the former possibility is more likely." "Globes": What can Vigodman do? Hershkowitz: "What Levin should have done is no longer possible for Vigodman. The Biotech Index, which tracks the companies that Teva could acquire, is up 100% since the start of the Levin era, and the acquisitions options are very limited. Vigodman can finally implement the promised streamlining plan, but streamlining won't boost the share price; growth engines are needed for that. He can sell non-strategic assets, such as the growing OTC venture for which he can get a good price, and use the proceeds to acquire strategic assets that will contribute to profits." Nevertheless, Teva's share is cheap. Given its risk-reward profile, isn't it worth buying? "It's very cheap, assuming that profits are maintained. But if the company does not carry out some kind of initiative to bring in profit-generating growth engines, and the ones it has lose their patents, there will be no profits and the share price will no longer be cheap. There is uncertainty now, and things will be very bad if 75% of the profits disappear and there is great uncertainty about what is going to replace them."

						    of management teams of our portfolio investments as well as through extensive
						    research process of companies, industries and macro trends.





Strategic focus on risk management

We constantly utilize a variety of tools and techniques to reduce volatility and hedge the portfolio's
 risk exposure. Among the tools employed are shorts, options, futures, convertible debt and high-yield debt.
 We do not employ leverage in our portfolios.
 We dedicate considerable resources to developing close, ongoing dialogue with management teams of existing
 and prospective investments, and consider the quality and credibility of management teams to be a critical factor in our investment considerations and risk management.





Focus on growth and profitability

Sphera’s investment objective is to identify companies with strong fundamentals  that generate sustainable growth and profitability over time.

				primarily in large cap Israeli equities trading in Israel,  US and European markets.

 companies with a variety of hedging strategies to reduce the fund’s market risk and volatility. The
 long-standing experience of our principals investing in Israeli & International companies provides
 us with a strong edge in identifying and accessing attractive investment opportunities in this particular
 universe of companies.

Long/short equity fund that is focused on the global pharmaceutical and biotech industries. The Investment Manager’s objective is to generate consistent and attractive long term returns exceeding the industry while maintaining disciplined risk management.

							• Unique and unbiased investment approach generated in part from access to massive flow of R &D, innovation and top tier human capital in Israel.





Why Healthcare?

Elimination of patent cliffs  -  driven  by  the  domination  of  biological  drugs,  is  an industry game changer.
							Increased demand for drugs – driven by extension of life expectancy  & increased consumption in emerging markets.
							Major R &D achievements - driven by breakthroughs in innovation.
