History[edit]





This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose. You can help by converting this article to prose, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (March 2014)


Perpetual was founded in 1885 by a committee of business and professional people with the purpose of forming a trustee company. The committee included the Honourable Edmund Barton who later became Australia's first Prime Minister.
Perpetual Trustee Company (Limited) was subsequently formed in 1886, originally based at 105 Pitt Street Sydney. James Fairfax (later Sir James Fairfax) was elected the first chairman, John Street was appointed the first managing director and John Pewtress, an accountant, became the first employee.
In 1888, a special act was granted to Perpetual (the power) to act as a corporate executor and trustee by the NSW Legislative Assembly. An increasing number of prominent citizens appointed Perpetual as executor or trustee of their estates – in many cases for generations.
Perpetual continued to develop a strong and secure reputation throughout the First World War and The Great Depression. At that time, Perpetual Trustee Company controlled trust estates to the value of £50,000,000, making it easily Australia’s largest trustee company. In 1935 all staff were required to sign an ‘Obligation of Secrecy’ book, a practice that continued until 1988.
In 1963, The Perpetual Executors & Trustees Association of Australia Ltd (Victoria) and Queensland Trustees Ltd, which had operated in their own states since the 1880s, merged with Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd (NSW).
In 1964 Perpetual listed its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange and this continues today.
During the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s (decade), Perpetual expanded beyond its traditional trustee business into the rapidly developing funds management industry. This included superannuation, financial advice, and corporate trustee and securitisation services.
Philanthropy[edit]
Trustee services were initially provided in the late 19th century when prosperous Australians began creating charitable endowments. Today Perpetual is Australia’s largest manager of philanthropic funds, including acting as trustee for over 450 charitable trusts. Perpetual have helped establish and manage trusts for medical, social, environmental, religious, cultural and educational purposes.
The Perpetual Foundation was established in 1998, to provide a way for the business, their staff and their clients to contribute to improving the lives of others. The Foundation is structured in a way that enables specific endowments to be established in their own name. Research and advice is provided to ensure funds are strategically invested and distributed to maximise their positive impact and that they are used as intended.
The Perpetual Foundation supports a range of charities and causes, a key objective is to direct funds towards charitable projects that focus on preventative measures and education, and projects that address the root cause of problems, rather than providing short-term remedies.
Ultimately, the Foundation aims to increase the capacity of communities and individuals to strengthen themselves and become more self-reliant.

Perpetual take advantage of victims that are vulnerable



 



1 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Jul 27, 2017    


My daughter was in an accident, her solicitors directed us to perpetual with not giving us the choices and advice what we can do. We directed to perpetual to manage her funds where she is given no choices and excess, now we are trying to get rid of them, and they are using all the tricks. Victims of accident are the one who lose the people that gain is these people taking advantage of victims money. We need people to come out In the public and raise awareness of how perpetual take control of vulnerable people'money to benefit them.

Super Scammers

        reviewed on Jul 26, 2017    



I've been trying to get my super transferred from Perpetual for years. On my first attempt, Perpetual informed me they did not do online transfers and I'd need to send a written request, fill out approx 6 forms, and have them all certified by a JP - by the time I got all this together, they'd cancelled my request due to inactivity. My second attempt resulted in several letters where they got my name wrong, so I couldn't transfer. By the time I had a legal letter responding to this, they'd cancelled my transfer due to inaction.

er again - this time they demanded I send my original birth certificate to them, and again by the time I had my lawyer write up a letter and a JP sign it to outline why this was not necessary, they'd cancelled my request due to inactivity. 
Last year, the Government changed the process for requesting rollovers and making it mandatory that ALL super funds submit to online transfer requests via the MyGov website. I made this request on OCTOBER 2016. Do I have my super transferred yet? Of course I don't. DO NOT use Perpetual Investments for anything if you ever want to see your money again.

Don't expect them to distribute your super if you pass away



 



1 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Oct 07, 2016    


My mother passed away almost 3 years ago.  The only thing that hasn't been distributed from her estate is her superannuation from Perpetual.  They have used every trick in the book to not pay out her super.  We want to close the last bit of my mothers estate off so we can move on with our lives.  It isn't even that much money as it wasn't her main superannuation account.  
I wouldn't trust this company with my super now that I know that they will do everything and nothing to look after my family if I were to pass away.

Perpetual Trustee - why you can't trust them



 



1 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Feb 05, 2014    



After more than 2 years this company is still mis-handling my mothers estate.
They have failed to collect expenses from rental properties.
Been fined for not paying taxes.
Been fined by ASIC for not paying bills.
They have been fined for not paying fines. 
Left an overdrawn account open and attracting fees and compound interest. (Knowing about it for 2 years)
Failed to end paid subscriptions, not closed bank accounts.
They have not even collected bank statements so are are unable to calculate and pay tax.  (Good luck getting away with th

at one yourself. )

The REAL "Bee in my bonnet" is this - After more than 2 years they have NO idea when they will distribute the estate and want to charge me big money for the privilege of their neglect. 

Do yourself a favour - do not use the Perpetual Trustee for your deceased estate!

It is hard for me to find words to describe this company.

                Slow, un-caring, uncooperative, poor financial management

History[edit]





This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose. You can help by converting this article to prose, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (March 2014)


Perpetual was founded in 1885 by a committee of business and professional people with the purpose of forming a trustee company. The committee included the Honourable Edmund Barton who later became Australia's first Prime Minister.
Perpetual Trustee Company (Limited) was subsequently formed in 1886, originally based at 105 Pitt Street Sydney. James Fairfax (later Sir James Fairfax) was elected the first chairman, John Street was appointed the first managing director and John Pewtress, an accountant, became the first employee.
In 1888, a special act was granted to Perpetual (the power) to act as a corporate executor and trustee by the NSW Legislative Assembly. An increasing number of prominent citizens appointed Perpetual as executor or trustee of their estates – in many cases for generations.
Perpetual continued to develop a strong and secure reputation throughout the First World War and The Great Depression. At that time, Perpetual Trustee Company controlled trust estates to the value of £50,000,000, making it easily Australia’s largest trustee company. In 1935 all staff were required to sign an ‘Obligation of Secrecy’ book, a practice that continued until 1988.
In 1963, The Perpetual Executors & Trustees Association of Australia Ltd (Victoria) and Queensland Trustees Ltd, which had operated in their own states since the 1880s, merged with Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd (NSW).
In 1964 Perpetual listed its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange and this continues today.
During the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s (decade), Perpetual expanded beyond its traditional trustee business into the rapidly developing funds management industry. This included superannuation, financial advice, and corporate trustee and securitisation services.
Philanthropy[edit]
Trustee services were initially provided in the late 19th century when prosperous Australians began creating charitable endowments. Today Perpetual is Australia’s largest manager of philanthropic funds, including acting as trustee for over 450 charitable trusts. Perpetual have helped establish and manage trusts for medical, social, environmental, religious, cultural and educational purposes.
The Perpetual Foundation was established in 1998, to provide a way for the business, their staff and their clients to contribute to improving the lives of others. The Foundation is structured in a way that enables specific endowments to be established in their own name. Research and advice is provided to ensure funds are strategically invested and distributed to maximise their positive impact and that they are used as intended.
The Perpetual Foundation supports a range of charities and causes, a key objective is to direct funds towards charitable projects that focus on preventative measures and education, and projects that address the root cause of problems, rather than providing short-term remedies.
Ultimately, the Foundation aims to increase the capacity of communities and individuals to strengthen themselves and become more self-reliant.
