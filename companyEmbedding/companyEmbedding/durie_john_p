Another Houston-based bank's CFO is stepping down.
Green Bancorp Inc. (Nasdaq: GNBC), the holding company of Green Bank N.A., announced Aug. 30 that CFO John Durie will step down on Oct. 31 to become CEO of Redstone Group Ltd. Redstone affiliates are significant customers of the bank and shareholders of the holding company, according to the press release.

Durie currently serves as executive vice president and CFO of the holding company and senior executive vice president and CFO of the bank. The company has begun a search for his successor, and Elizabeth Vandervoort, the bank’s executive vice president and chief accounting officer, will be interim CFO.




Durie joined Green Bank as part of the company’s 2006 acquisition of Houston-based Redstone Bank, which was formed by The Redstone Cos. He will become a member of the bank’s board of directors on Nov. 1.
“It has been a truly rewarding experience to participate in building Green Bank from a small de novo bank to close to $4 billion in assets in a relatively short period of time,” Durie said in Green Bank’s Aug. 30 press release. “I look forward to continuing my work with the bank in my new role as a member of the bank’s board of directors.”
Green Bancorp has continued to make acquisitions in recent years. The company bought Houston-based Patriot Bancshares Inc. for approximately $139 million last year and acquired of SP Bancorp Inc. (Nasdaq: SPBC), the parent holding company of Dallas-based SharePlus Bank, for $46.2 million in 2014. Green Bancorp also went public in the summer of 2014.




 


Durie's announcement comes less than a week after Houston-based Allegiance Bancshares Inc. (Nasdaq: ABTX), the holding company of Allegiance Bank Texas, announced that Laurence Lehman III resigned from the bank, effective immediately.
