Pine Hill Associates LLC | Certified Business Coaching























































The Six Impacts of High Impact Organizations












Habit 1: Set Direction
It’s one thing to have your organization’s value, vision or mission statement.  It’s another to use these to set and guide direction.   Words support actions, decisions, and priorities.  What to work on, what to leave undone.  People in high impact organizations know they will be supported when making a less popular choice, because it is right.  In a lower impact organization, words inconsistent with actions fool no one, regardless of a few leaders’ wishes, marketing, slogans or other attempts.







Habit 2: What is at Stake?
Determine how life will be better, or how you will suffer if you don’t get there.  Belief that the journey will make you better.

Our brain tricks us into feeling like we’ve accomplished something just because we’ve planned it.  Planning is critical.  Commitment to accomplish the plan is more important.  Even before solving all the inevitable obstacles in the way of achieving something important, a high impact organization has clarified what’s at stake.







Habit 3: What contribution are we each making?
Research tells us that we are far less able to predict the outcome of our initial plans than we think.   We have many hundreds of examples of failed ideas of bright and capable people and teams.  High impact organizations follow a concerted process for trying things.   Creating and sustaining the high impact organization is everyone’s job.  Success is best, failure is an option, in which case quick failure is preferred.  Important lessons are then applied.







Habit 4: To what degree are we willing to try different things?
People are a product of their habits.  Attitudes are simply habits of thought.  Every organization is perfectly designed to get the results it gets.  Some of our longest standing habits no longer serve us or our market well.  Our heart may even know, yet we are locked in, like Groundhog Day.  You need knowledge and skill to do your job well, yet most failures are caused by attitude and habit.  High impact organizations look first to habit change before they look to new gizmos, new tools, new shiney things.  Automating bad habits results in efficient, bad habits.  It’s harder to change ourselves..







Habit 5: How will we know when we get there?
A great novel holds your attention for the way the characters move forward.  People in these stories are interesting for all their traits.  Flaws and all, characters become ours only through movement and interaction.  High impact organizations write their own story by tracking movement.   They measure judiciously to develop knowledge and reduce variation.  People come to know where they are headed, where they are today, and when they’ve arrived.  The old saying goes, you get what you measure.  High impact organizations celebrate their successes!







Habit 6: To what degree is improvement an ongoing process?
Interpersonal issues in organizations are generally caused by three potential misalignments:  Goals, Roles and Processes.  People may start off in the right role with one agenda.  Over time, things inevitably change.  Roles may assume agendas separate from the team, or expectations become misaligned with the job-holder’s greatest strengths.

Bad process kills good people.  High impact organizations continually improve their processes to support best value to loyal customers time and time again.














We coach businesses in Greater Hartford area.
What really drives performance in your small to medium sized business?
We have found six habits that, when present, generally result in a high impact organization. People in these organizations continually achieve their predetermined goals. They believe in themselves and maintain balance in their individual lives. These necessary habits are different from those required in a large corporate environment.
We work to instill these habits through process and structure, personal development, goal achievement, planning and business improvement.



Positive, Lasting Change
We offer developmental processes in which an organization is set up to succeed within an ever-changing, customer-focused environment. These processes are designed to help people view themselves in terms of their potential, develop effective interpersonal skills which nurture their organization’s strategic mission, and learn how to effectively set and achieve personal and professional goals.
