Dr. Rebecca Thompson – Infection, Immunity, Transplantation

Dr. Rebecca Thompson
Infection, Immunity, Transplantation
















Rebecca Thompson, Ph.D., is the Senior Director of Quality at Cell Culture Company (formerly Biovest International) in Minneapolis, MN. Cell Culture Company provides custom manufacturing solutions for biologics. Services include custom cell culture, purification and analytical testing for RUO, IVD, GMP, QSR and FDA-approved products. Specifically Rebecca oversees technology transfer, environmental monitoring, and release testing.
Previously, Dr. Thompson was a Quality Control Senior Scientist at Biovest International, a personalized medicine company specializing in Dasiprotimut-T, an autologous therapeutic cancer vaccine to fight non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. She developed and validated bioanalytical assays for different stages of the vaccine process. Her direct responsibility involved the completion of eight ELISAs on the Tecan robotics system. This phase III clinical trial drug product was filed with the EMA for marketing approval in the European Union.
Prior to working for Cell Culture Company, Dr. Thompson was the Technical Supervisor of Cellular Immunology at Pharmasan Labs, a state of the art CLIA reference laboratory in northern Wisconsin. In this role her responsibilities included analyzing assay data, verifying patient test results and monitoring technical performance for five immunological assays. These assays included lymphocyte subset analysis, metal allergy testing, NK cell activity, Lyme disease testing and cytokine testing. These assays utilized flow cytometry, B-cell proliferation, chromium release, T-cell ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) and cytokine multiplex methods. Rebecca was recruited to the company due to her expertise in working with human PBMCs, B cells and ELISA assay development.
Dr. Thompson’s education includes a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences specializing in infection, immunity and transplantation and a B.S. in pharmaceutical sciences majoring in pharmacology and toxicology with a minor in biochemistry. Her doctoral work at the University of Toledo Health Science Campus explored the B-cell immune response following vaccination with the purified pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, Pneumovax® in groups at high risk for infection. These clinical studies identified the immune dysfunction in HIV-positive and elderly individuals in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Her thesis project involved PCR amplification of VH/VL regions of pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific B-cells, transformation of regions into a bacterial vector, gene analysis, cloning into a mammalian expression vector, transfection of vector into mammalian cells and testing its avidity to pneumococcal polysaccharides. Additionally she developed fluorescently labeled pneumococcal polysaccharides to allow for the identification and phenotype analysis of pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific B cells using flow cytometry. Her areas of expertise include antibody avidity and carbohydrate chemistry. Dr. Thompson has presented her work internationally.

 "You don’t have to answer me, but I’m happy to listen if you’d like to share." Teaching your kids the art of self-reflection


We’ve been talking about staying connected with our kids as they grow in my parenting support classes for parents of teens and tweens. Parents want to support their growing kids to become interdependent adults who are aware of themselves and their needs and are aware of others around them. 
You know, we want to raise the kid who notices when your hands are full and it might be helpful for him to hold the door open for you or to grab a bag to help? Or the ones who can take respons

 The Dance of Independence with Our Kids; Tween and Teen Support Classes Information


We all want our kids to grow up to be as independent as possible, right? As the mother of two boys, who are now somehow almost 18 and just turned 13, I know it is on my mind quite a lot. Did you know that the independence our kids show as older kids and teens starts when they're babies? Even in the womb? And the foundation of independence is actually dependence and interdependence? Let me explain.

 "Christmas Vacation" meets "It's a Wonderful Life" or How Christmas Didn't Crash and Burn


Happy New Year! What's on your heart and mind as the new year begins?
Were your holidays peaceful and loving? Or a chaotic? Or full of family drama? I'd love to hear!
Did you ever see the movie Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase? There are several scenes where Chevy is very frustrated and upset. He kicks and beats up plastic reindeer from his front yard. He cuts down a tree from his front yard with a chain saw to replace the one burned down by his elderly relative.

 "I'm here to bring hope," said my 10 year-old


I spent the weekend thinking deeply about my life’s purpose, immersed in Oprah’s Live the Life You Want weekend in Miami. I came home and was sharing some of my experiences with a friend on the phone when I noticed my son was listening intently. He’ll be 11 next month and has always been a deep and sensitive soul, especially with me.  
I was sharing that Oprah began with the words, “Why are you here? What are you here to do in this life?”
My son looked into my eyes and said, “I

 Feeling isolated? We can help!


“I’m the only one I know who is parenting this way,” she said on the phone from Boston. “Parents are really conservative here and it is hard to find any alternative community.”

The same day, a mom in Perth, Western Australia said, “I feel really isolated here. We don’t know many other families and those we do know don’t really understand what we’re doing and why.”

It happened again the following day talking to a mom in rural Georgia. And then a mom in Ken

 A Gift for YOU as Consciously Parenting Celebrates 7 Years


The Consciously Parenting Project began 7 years ago today. 
Consciously Parenting was founded in loving memory of my son, Jacob, who came into the world at 10am on this date 12 years ago and passed away at noon the same day, leaving my world forever changed. Jacob was born with a birth defect incompatible with life. He was born at home by choice and spent his entire life held by those who loved him.
The struggle that followed his death far exceeded my ability to cope, though I really

 Creating a Family Life that Works for YOU!


Last week, I was kind of stressed out. OK, I was more than a little stressed. Our family wasn't working well- not the way I wanted it to, anyway. My work time was getting squished, bedtimes were getting later and later, I wasn't getting enough sleep... (maybe you've had a similar experience??) I wasn't happy. I was getting short with my kids because I was frustrated. My to-do list was long, but so was the time it was taking to get out the door to school in the morning. My nights and my work

 Healing on Mother's Day


Mother’s Day 2014
There is so much of each person’s story that comes up on Mother’s Day. As I scrolled through my Facebook feed today, I was really struck by the glimpses of my friends’ stories about their mothers and mother figures in their lives. From the charming pictures of my friends with their own children to the heartbreak of my friend whose mother is under hospice care and hasn’t woken up today (but has been very peacefully sleeping with loved ones nearby), it is clear that mothers

 New Beginnings


Welcome to my blog! I've been writing here intermittently for the past several years since the IT guy I consulted (who I happened to have nannied when he was small- ugh!) suggested that blogging was just like journaling in public. I like to write, so it seemed like a good fit. He held my hand and told me how to get it all set up (thanks, Matt!) and my blog was born.

I've had some good runs with my blog and I've been able to write about many topics that are near and dear to my heart.

 When the Unexpected Happens


Life often throws unexpected things into our path and we get to decide how we handle them. We don't always get to choose what we will face, but we do have a choice about what we do next.

This past year has been really rough for me in many ways. Though I separated from my husband and we have both moved on with our own lives, and even though things have been quite unexpectedly adversarial between us, I still care about him and want the best for him. Even though some of his choices hav

 Struggling with Tantrums and Emotional Upsets?


It seems like we're all there at one point or another. I've noticed that it is more likely to occur when I'm least able to handle it.

One of my clients described his daughter falling apart and laying in the middle of the sidewalk like a starfish, sobbing and screaming.

Other clients relay situations where it is a fight to get out the door every morning. Or every time they need to get buckled up. At bath time. Or when their child needs to get dressed. Or when it is time

 Rebecca's No Good, Very Bad Day Turn Around


I woke up one morning last week and before I had even rolled out of bed, I realized that my day was going to be completely different than the one I envisioned before I went to sleep last night.  A series of text messages greeted me with things I needed to take care of that I just hadn't anticipated. That followed by several emails I wasn't expecting with more things I needed to do.

My head began to spin. I wanted to just go back to bed.

 When you give your best and it's not enough


One of my clients recently was talking about the anguish she felt as her marriage was ending. She was working hard to speak kindly about her soon to be ex-husband in front of their children, remembering that this was a person in pain. But something she said really struck me. She said, "It is so hard when you give your best and it's not enough."

 Finding YOUR own True North


I was talking to a friend about my first radio show topic, Finding Your Own True North. "How did you find your true north?" I asked. He said, "That's easy. Something tragic happens, you emerge from the fog, eventually, and suddenly everything is more clear and you know what's important and what's not." He had lost his wife suddenly a couple of years before. That kind of loss, I've seen from my clients, brings clarity when someone finds their way through to living life again.

Rebecca Thompson





















Rebecca Thompson
Internal Sales Executive


Over 10 years of being in an Engineering/ Project Coordinating role has really helped me diversify into the Exhibition and Retail World.
I have been working for Unibox for nearly 2 years now. I love the fast pace and wide range of projects that come our way.
Dealing with both Retail and Exhibition clients, a lot of projects come to me as a basic concept idea. It’s great to see this through the development stage and deliver an end product which meets their needs.
About me; I love adventure sports, visiting new places and meeting new people. I'm always happy to help!
