Fabric is sold by the yard. A yard is measured as 36 inches in length by the standard width of the roll. For example, if you purchase 1 yard of a fabric with a width of 54-inches, you will receive a piece of fabric which is 36 inches long by 54 inches wide.

All stock fabrics ship within 48 hours.  We will confirm availability upon receipt of your order.   If you prefer to check stock prior to placing an order, please email us the manufacturer, the pattern name or number, the color and the quantity.  We will get back to you immediately with stock information.
 



Limit 20 swatches per order. US addresses only.
Our fabric swatch is a memo sample ranging from 4 " x 6" to 12" x 18" in size.  The sizes are cut randomly.  We are unable to order specific sizes.  If you need a large sample, we recommend ordering one whole yard.


Samples are not guaranteed for dye lot.  If you need to match a specific dye lot, please request a cut for approval with your fabric order.
All swatches are shipped by first class mail.  Please allow 7-10 days for transit time.  Swatches normally ship within 48-72 hours upon receipt of your order.  Occasionally, we might have back-orders, in which case we will advise you of the estimated ship time.


If you no longer need the sample, a return envelope is provided for your convenience.   This eliminates waste and saves the environment.  You are not obligated to return the sample.

Where?My current locationSearchHomeSalinas, CAMartinSalinas, CA MartinAbout Search ResultsAbout Search ResultsYP - The Real Yellow PagesSM - helps you find the right local businesses to meet your specific needs. Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Martin Colijn CPA1514 Moffett St Ste BSalinas, CA 93905(831) 424-3800Accountants-Certified PublicBookkeepingAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection2. Martin Bill & Son59 Corral De Tierra RdSalinas, CA 93908(831) 484-9268Excavation ContractorsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection3. Martin Jefferson & Sons299 Neponset RdSalinas, CA 93908(831) 384-1300Fruit & Vegetable Growers & ShippersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection4. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Academy925 N Sanborn RdSalinas, CA 93905(831) 796-3916Preschools & KindergartenWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Guzman Martin210 Capitol St Ste 1Salinas, CA 93901(831) 676-3255Employee Benefits & Worker...WebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection6. Martin Steve59 Corral De Tierra RdSalinas, CA 93908(831) 484-9268Construction ConsultantsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Colijn, Martin, CPA18921 Portola Dr Ste ESalinas, CA 93908(831) 424-3800Accountants-Certified PublicBookkeepingAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection8. Martins Al - CLOSED601 El Camino Real NSalinas, CA 93907(831) 449-2178Outboard MotorsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection9. Martin Luther King1713 Broadway AveSeaside, CA 93955(831) 392-3970Preschools & KindergartenWebsiteFrom Business: Martin Luther King Junior K-8 School serves students in kindergarten through grade five.

Cushions
In today’s home the humble cushion is as common place as the chair or sofa it sits upon. Quite simply the easiest and most accessible way to style any living space, cushions are one of the most popular home accessories available. With over 1000 styles to choose from online at Amara, from scatter cushions to floor cushions, the variation in style is overwhelming in itself let alone material, filling and design. We take you through everything you need to know about finding the perfect cushions for your space...
History
Cushions and pillows are now a clearly divided range of home accessories, but in the beginning they were really the same thing. In ancient times Egyptians would use stone or marble blocks with a half moon shape cut to lay their head on. It is believed rather than for comfort these types of early pillows/cushions were used more to keep bugs from crawling into ears. There is also evidence to suggest that the Romans were using cushions too, of the softer variety, and the Zafu meditation cushion has its roots in ancient Chinese and Japanese history.
It is also said that in Europe during the Middle Ages, when cushions & pillows were a status symbol, King Henry VIII banned the use except for himself and pregnant women.  The industrial revolution finally saw the widespread use of both cushions & pillows in the UK when they became mass-produced by companies in the United States, making them more affordable.
Coming along way from then, luxury cushions are now used in everyday society, and are as much a style addition as they are a comfort creator. Used on sofas, chairs, beds, daybeds and floor spaces they can transform a room’s look as well as help create a relaxing living area.

Floor Cushions and Bean Bags
Floor cushion is a term used for luxury bean bags and poufs, essentially any type of cushion that lives on the floor. Bean bags are often used as an extra chair and poufs can be used for both sitting on and resting your feet. Ideal for adding an accent of colour or pattern to your room, when choosing the right one it is important to consider your current interior. Unlike the standard scatter cushion, floor cushions are usually bought singularly so are unlikely to transform a room’s decor and therefore they need to be incorporated into the existing style.
Scatter Cushions
Scatter cushions are incredibly versatile and can be used to accentuate existing themes in your decor or they can be used to create a new style completely. Available in many different sizes, the most regular being 40x40cm or 50x50cm, they tend to be square in shape or rectangular. Different shapes work really well together, adding depth to a sofa or bed, when complementing style and colour palettes are used.
Cushions Pads
Cushions are either sold with a pad or without one; at Amara if the cushion comes without a pad it will always be called a cushion cover. Many brands tend to produce the vast majority of their cushions with a pad, e.g. Designers Guild, or without e.g. Lexington. Cushion covers are a great idea if you like to keep up to date with the latest trends and seasonal looks. Invest in a high quality pad and then simply change the cover as you wish, without having to buy the entire cushion each time.
The pad is almost as important as the style; a beautiful design is no good if the cushion is lumpy or uncomfortable. The most luxurious, and most commonly used at Amara, is the duck feather filled cushion pad. Soft and long lasting, most duck feather filled pads are dry clean only, and for best results need regular airing and plumping.
Design & Style
The fun part is choosing the right design and this is all about personal preference, purpose and style. Designer cushions are just like designer clothes in that they can completely transform a look, but in this instance it is the interior not the wardrobe. Colour palette is a great place to start, always pick out key shades that are already used in your decor and match with coordinating tones in the cushion designs. If the room you are adding cushions to has plain walls, say white or cream, or just a block colour then you can add patterned designs to create interest. Another important factor is texture, first think about the texture of the sofa or bed linen that the cushion will be layered on and make sure it will work with the cushion’s texture.
Material
The material of the cushion cover can vary wildly from most typically cotton, to velvet or silk. Choosing the right material is really down to where you want to place your cushion and what you want to use it for. For a cushion intended to be placed on the sofa, that will be used every day for comfort as well as style, cotton is the best option. Durable, usually machine washable and still soft cotton is also probably the most widely used fabric for cushion covers.
Wool or wool felt is also another popular choice that features a beautiful texture, but will need to be dry cleaned. Silk is one of the most luxurious materials that a cushion can be made from, with its smooth texture and high quality feel it is best reserved for cushions that are going to be placed on a bed or an occasional chair. Cushion covers that require more care are more ideal for decorative use over comfort, not to say that they shouldn’t still be comfortable.
Transform your Living Space
Use bold & lively patterned cushions to brighten up a plain decor, vibrant styles are also great for giving an old sofa or chair an instant makeover. Remember to mix size as well as style, a great format for cushions on a bed is two 60x60cm sized cushions mixed with two smaller styles, say 30x30cm, with plain reverses and patterned fronts. This is ideal for adding comfort, style & depth all in one, the cushions can also be reversed for an instant change.  Rectangular shape cushions work well with arm chairs and can also be used to layer with other sized scatter cushions.  Don’t forget that there are now also many outdoor suitable scatter cushions & floor cushions available, so you can style your garden furniture, poolside or yacht in the same way as you living space.
Be adventurous with your choices, cushions aren’t a permanent fixture in your home or outdoor space so it’s safe to experiment. Mixing zigzags or stripes with florals is a great way to break up the designs, but always use similar colours to avoid over clashing. For the less adventurous, try a patterned cushion mixed with several plains, pick a colour from the patterned piece and choose plains in this colour to accentuate the pattern without being overbearing.
Lastly, think about cushions as a personalised touch to an overall decor theme. They can bring all the elements of your interior together by simply fusing colours and patterns found around the room. A great style counts on the details, and this is extremely true in cushions. Details such as appliqué, embroidery, fringing and tassels can be the perfect finishing touch to your cushion arrangement and in turn your room’s overall style.
