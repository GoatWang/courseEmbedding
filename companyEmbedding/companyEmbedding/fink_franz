I would now like to turn the call over to Franz.
Franz Fink
Welcome and thank you for joining us this afternoon. On today's call we will review our first quarter 2017 financial performance and business outlook, recent significant announcements and progress with our strategy.
Starting with a brief comment on financials, we came in favorably on all fronts versus our previous guidance coming in at the top end of the range for revenue and gross margin and to bottom end of the range on operating expense. Dave will provide additional color on the financials later in the call, however I want to emphasize that we are on track to achieve our Q4 2017 financial goals of near 30% gross margins and breakeven adjusted EBITDA.

Let me now provide you an update on progress with our strategy. Last quarter we laid out the three strategic imperatives that our team has been diligently working to put in place. To recap, these include, first, to maintain our leadership position and expand market share with our high-voltage product line which provides foundational cash flow and the opportunity for steady long-term growth.
Second, to narrow our ultracapacitor market focus and optimize our portfolio investments to drive diversification, achieve scale and transition the business to higher growth opportunities with the Nesscap acquisition as a key ingredient of this strategy. And third, to leverage our revolutionary dry battery electrode technology by establishing partnerships with industry leaders in automotive and energy storage to unlock new applications Maxwell which could generate significant future revenues in a massive multibillion dollar market.
The latest significant step we have taken which we announced last month was a strategic investment of approximately $47 million in Maxwell from China's SDIC Fund Management Company which we expect to close in Q3 2017 after CFIUS review and other customary closing conditions are met. With significant investments in two leading Chinese battery companies, SDIC is expected to enhance our access to China's largest automotive battery companies which makes our strategic partnership important to Maxwell's hybrid capacitor and dry battery electric proliferation strategy.
This SDIC relationship is also anticipated to deepen our existing China localization strategy in one of the largest and fastest growing energy storage markets for transportation and grid. We anticipate that investment from SDIC will significantly strengthen our balance sheet and provide the capital necessary to make investments in our strategic technology development programs and demonstrate long term sustainability to our customers and large dry battery electrode partners.
I will discuss this important accomplishment in greater detail later in the call. Now I will update you on our progress with each imperative. Starting with our high voltage product line, our strategy is to intersect the paradigm shift happening now in the global high voltage market, particularly in the United States, China and India with the goal to grow revenue and foundational cash flow over the next five years. As discussed last quarter, we introduced several new products last year which are now showing increasing demand. Among them are a customized capacitor to support transient events exceeding norms in complex electrical substations, which is an innovative design that improves robustness in the high-altitude capacitor for applications higher than 3000 meters which permits the electrical grid to cross higher mountains.
Until now capacity constants have limited our revenue potential for high-voltage products to about $50 million annually. To eliminate this constraint, this year we embarked on a factory expansion which will enable by 2021 about $70 million in revenue annually in the $150 million addressable market. We are on track to complete the factory expansion and be ready for production by the beginning of 2018. Our second imperative is to drive diversification, achieve scale and transition our business to higher growth opportunities with our ultra-capacitor products. Acquiring the operating business of Nesscap has been a critical strategic milestone to this imperative.
I am happy to report that we closed this transaction on April 28 as planned. The strength of our now combined product portfolio will significantly increase our global market presence and opportunity pipeline, particularly in Europe and Asia. The Nesscap best in class small cell product portfolio combined with Maxwell's leadership in large cell solutions, will meet the short and long term needs of the automotive, grid, wind and industrial markets. With an increase in R&D capability and operational efficiency, we hope to better enable our customers in these markets with the most competitive value which we expect will enable their next generation differentiating solutions.

Our top priorities for integration are to further build out our near and long-term pipeline enabled by a comprehensive optimized product portfolio, to capture operational and technological synergies, and to improve manufacturing efficiency and time to market of our new innovative products. We have also made great progress with restructuring we announced in Q1 and combined with Nesscap synergies, we are no track to achieving the savings we projected.
Now that the acquisition has closed, we are charging forward on integration with our larger team including specifically the strengthening of our manufacturing footprint by increasing scale through our new operational capabilities in Korea. Turning to our current business. I would like to provide a short update on each of our markets including bus, auto, grid, rail and wind.
I will start with bus where we are on track with our partner in China, CRRCSRI, to localize manufacturing of our ultracapacitor base modules and expect to be ready for production in the fourth quarter. As discussed last quarter, we are conservative in our revenue assumptions for 2017 with minimal revenue contribution from China bus and an expectation that meaningful growth would resume in 2018. We do think there is an increasing possibility for upside in Q4 of this year as we are seeing new demand in China bus as we can meet very aggressive short term pricing and volume requirements that could lower our overall gross margins but still would improve EBITDA. We are working with multiple customers and should be able to provide more definitive information in our next earnings call.
Moving next to auto. Our pipeline of opportunities continues to be driven by applications in start-stop, e-active suspension, electric turbo and backup solutions for a number of functions. We continue to work with our customers and partners on an increasing number of opportunities with a total of 14 confirmed design-ins at various stages of progress and in several different application. Our team continues to make tremendous headway and continues to engage deeply with both existing and new automotive customers further validating our premise that increasing demands of vehicle electrification drives an increased need for capacitive energy storage products as evidenced by our growing opportunity pipeline.
I want to reiterate our belief that inflection point in this market will occur in late 2018. Next, I would like to discuss grid and rail. In grid, we continue to gain momentum with several pilot projects including one we have discussed in the past with a lead global OEM on a system design where we are making very strong progress on the pilot program that we expect to result in a long-term commercial agreement and first system deployment in 2018.
Driven by our portfolio of differentiating new products, we are seeing increasing interest from new potential customers in our solution. We are working on an increasing number of opportunities in our growing pipeline of design opportunities is setting the foundation for revenue rent in late 2018, early 2019 timeframe, in rail, our lithium capacitor or LCAP partnership with CRRCSRI is progressing nicely with initial pilot scale volume shipments continuing to gradually ramp throughout this year.
We are collaborating with our partner to establish high volume manufacturing capability as well as working on second generation product and will provide an update on the progress later this year. Lastly, let me update you on wind where we saw Q1 tracking slightly higher than anticipated. We expect a typical Q2 with seasonal growth and demand driven by China wind and we expect this strength to carry into Q3 as China's wind market continues to solidify and slightly grow.
Ongoing curtailment of electricity generation remains a challenge for wind power projects. However, the China government has indicated that they are working to resolve transmission and associated infrastructure bottlenecks. Likewise, we anticipate slow and steady project development growth in Europe and emerging regions for the remainder of the year as the price of wind energy decreases and becomes more cost competitive for both offshore and onshore installations.

Moving to the third strategic imperative which focuses on our dry battery electric technology, I would like to discuss more about our new and exciting partnership with SDIC. First, this alliance enables leverage in regards to our ability to control our IP in the future. We now have a partner who believes so much in our team and in our technology that they are willing to invest $47 million in the company. The capital from the financing is expected to enable us to make future investments in technology and assets with a reliance solely on funding from partners and to put us in a better position as we move down the path to commercialization of our dry battery electrode technology.
Second, based on SDIC's relationships on the ground in the industry in China, this partnership will likely open up opportunities for strategic collaboration as SDIC has significant investments in China's energy storage industry including two of the top battery companies and several major system integrators in the new energy market as well as leading OEMs in the China auto and grid industries. This substantial presence in China should also help deepen our China localization strategy. China continues to be very important to Maxwell, thus having a partner with an extensive network in the region is a very valuable asset.
Further to that point, one of the global automotive companies currently working with us on our dry battery electrode technology proof of concept was very positive about SDIC's relationships with high volume battery manufacturing. From a technology advancement perspective, our team is steadily making progress with our partners on our dry battery electrode joint development project.
This quarter we achieved several critical performance criteria. Capacitance, resistance, efficiency, [porosity] [ph] with our dry battery electrode technology and demonstrated our ability to process meters and meters of electrode on rolls of both the battery anode and cathode using our existing pile of scale infrastructure, meeting yet another significant milestone towards high volume commercialization. This independent accomplishments confirms that high volume production is feasible and that our technology is scalable. Our team is now preparing to produce larger rolls with our partners to build higher capacitor cells for electric vehicle platform validation.
As we near completion of the proof of concept and consider future joint developments and commercialization efforts, we are seeing continued interest from three additional parties as well as increasing interest from others, all of which are large brand name global players in the energy storage and automotive industries. Given our recent successes with the proof of concept and the growing interest from several global leaders, we expect to make more progress both independently as well as through broader collaboration and commercialization agreements towards the end of 2017 and into 2018.
Before I hand the call over to Dave, I want to say that I am very proud of our team's accomplishments of the past three years since I started at Maxwell. We began by shifting our very broad market focus to a more targeted investment approach. We restructured the organization to reduce operating expense by about 25%. Consolidated our ultracapacitor factories into your state of the art facility in Peoria, Arizona to help protect gross margins. Sold our non-strategic, micro-electronics product line for about $21 million to bolster the balance sheet and enable us to bridge to our 2018 inflection point.
We refreshed our high voltage product portfolio and we are in the process of increasing the capacity in our high voltage factory this year to enable Maxwell to capitalize on our leadership position in a market paradigm shift impend it facilitate revenue growth and solidify foundational cash flow. For ultracapacitor, we prioritized our investments, created critical development partnerships including signing our China business localization partnership with CRRCSRI. We realigned our cost to match the current forecasted business and with the closing of the Nesscap acquisition, solidified our ultracapacitor portfolio to achieve scale and enhance mid to long term growth.

As it has become a priority for our organization, we remain determined to leverage and to gradually shift key investments into our breakthrough dry batter electrode technology to capitalize on the significant upside opportunity in the long-term. To that end, we signed a joint development agreement with the leading global automotive OEM and tier one supplier on the proof of concept to validate pilot volume dry battery electrode performance targeting a specific electric vehicle platform in 2021-22. Most recently, we initiated a highly strategic partnership with SDIC in China which is expected to enable better access to key China battery companies. With these strategic imperatives behind us or in process, we believe that we now have the necessary pieces of the strategy in place and our focus is on executing next strategy to ultimately drive long-term profitable growth and shareholder value.
I would now like to turn the call over to Dave to discuss our financial results.
David Lyle
Thanks, Franz. Today I will discuss our Q1 results, our outlook for Q2 with a little commentary about 2017 as a whole, as well as 2018 and recent announcements.
Starting with Q1, our first quarter revenue was $26.7 million, at the top end of our guidance range of $25 million to $27 million, driven by higher sequential ultracapacitor revenue mainly in the wind market, somewhat offset by lower high voltage revenue. Ultracapacitor revenue was $14.2 million and high voltage capacitor revenue was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 23.9%, at the high end of our guidance range of 20% to 24%, driven by a favorable product mix and slightly improved factory utilization.
Q1 non-GAAP gross margin excludes $193,000 of stock based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating expense for Q1 was $12.4 million at the lower end of our guidance range. Q1 non-GAAP operating expense excludes $1.3 million of stock based compensation expense, $997,000 in restructuring costs, $275,000 in transaction cost associated with the Nesscap acquisition and $180,000 in costs related to certain legal matters.
Q1 non-GAAP net loss was $7.4 million, resulting in a net loss per share of $0.23. GAAP net loss was $10.4 million for the quarter, GAAP net loss per share was $0.32 based on a basic share count of about 32.2 million shares. Q1 adjusted EBITDA was negative $3.9 million and unadjusted EBITDA was negative $7 million. Q1 tax expense was approximately $1.2 million. Our Q1 cash balance was about $20.9 million, slightly above our guidance target of $20 million. DSOs for the first quarter were approximately 74 days and inventory turns were 2.7 times.
Now I would like to talk more about Nesscap and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We closed the acquisition of Nesscap's operating business on April 28, as planned. Our team is now executing on our integration strategy. There is a lot of work to be done but we feel confident that we have solid plans in place to achieve the anticipated synergies that we identified in diligence which include margin expansion through economies of scale and material cost savings, improved revenue growth and diversification through an expanded product portfolio and [indiscernible] expansion, as well as backend operational cost savings.
In Q2 we expect net cash revenue contribution to be about $4 million, reflecting contribution from two-thirds of the quarter with non-GAAP gross margin from this revenue to be in the range of 20% to 23%. We expect Nesscap to add an additional $700,000 to $900,000 in non-GAAP operating expense in Q2 but expect to offset this operating expense with benefits generated from our restructuring efforts executed last quarter.
As a result, we expect Nesscap to be accretive in Q2. Please note that as a base line for revenue modeling going forward, if we close the transaction on April 1 and received a full quarter benefit from Nesscap, we would have expected to see contribution of $5 million to $6 million in revenue in Q2. We have plans to fully integrate Nesscap into our ultracapacitor business and as such we will not present operating metrics specific to Nesscap in our earnings releases going forward. Thus for Q2 results and Q3 guidance, Nesscap revenue will be included in overall ultracapacitor revenue and gross margin and operating expense will be included in overall Maxwell numbers that we report.

Moving to overall Q2 guidance. We expect Maxwell's top line revenue to grow by 33% at the midpoint of the guidance range of $34 million to $37 million, driven by significantly stronger organic ultracapacitor revenue, primarily in the China wind market and that includes about $4 million partial quarter revenue from Nesscap. I Q2 we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be slightly down sequentially at 23%, plus or minus 200 basis points. We believe that we are able to maintain gross margins around 23% because higher utilization in our Peoria factory is offsetting pressure from higher ultracapacitor revenue.
Despite that pressure, we believe we are on track to meet our goal of raising corporate gross margins back to historical levels nearing 30% in Q4 of this year. We anticipate excluding about $300,000 in inventory step-up due to the acquisition of Nesscap and $200,000 in stock based compensation expense from Q2 non-GAAP gross margin. We expect Q2 non-GAAP operating expense including Nesscap, to be in the range of $12.6 million to $13 million, slightly higher than Q1, which reflects the addition of the Nesscap business offset by savings we achieved from our restructuring in Q1. We estimate our Q2 non-GAAP operating expense will exclude approximately $1.9 million in stock based compensation expense, $1.6 million of transaction related cost associated with the Nesscap acquisition, and approximately $500,000 associated with SDIC, SEC and investor related legal matters.
We expect our tax expense in Q2 to about $1.2 million, mostly associated with taxes on income of our Swiss subsidiary. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect Q2 non-GAAP net loss per share to be $0.17 and GAAP net loss per share to be $0.29 based on a basic share count of about 35.5 million shares, which includes the weighted average impact of 4.1 million shares issued in the acquisition of the Nesscap business. At the midpoint of guidance, Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be about negative $2.1 million and unadjusted EBITDA is expected to be negative $6.6 million.
In regards to cash, we expect our cash balance at the end of Q2 to be in the $15 million to $18 million range depending on working capital changes and collection from a large customer. This guidance includes $3.3 million in expected Nesscap acquisition, cash transaction related costs, which offset expected favorable working capital changes. Now turning to the reminder of 2017 and beyond. We are on track with our China bus localization partner, CRRCSRI in building out their factory in China, obtaining the applicable localization certification and readying our products for production in the fourth quarter.
As Franz mentioned earlier, we have conservatively forecasted minimal revenue from China bus in 2017. However, we are working on an upside opportunity that has the potential for increased Q4 revenue and corporate gross profit but that could negatively impact gross margins due to aggressive pricing requirements. We hope to be able to provide more clarity next quarter as we move further along with our customers. For 2018 in China bus we still expect to see revenue growth that should ramp as the year progresses. In 2017, we expect that auto will continue to remain on a solid revenue run rate with growth still expected in the latter half of 2018 at our anticipated inflection point.
Keeping with our prior guidance, we also expect nominal growth in 2017 from both grid and rail with the inflection point in those markets to commence in late 2018 going into 2019. Also, please note that we expect to see additional revenue from the Nesscap acquisition in the auto, wind and industrial markets for our ultracapacitor products. For Maxwell as a whole I would like to reiterate that we are on track to meeting our prior guidance and nearing 30% gross margins, breakeven adjusted EBITDA in Q4 of this year.

Lastly, I would like to provide additional color on our recent announcement of our collaboration with SDIC Fund Management Company. We signed a stock purchase agreement whereby SDIC is anticipated to purchase approximately 7.4 million common shares for $6.32 per share which equates to an investment of about $47 million before transaction cost and subject to closing conditions including CFIUS revenue and necessary approvals from the relevant Chinese governmental authority. We expect this transaction to close in Q3 and following the closing, SDIC is expected to own roughly 16.6% of Maxwell's total issued and outstanding shares of common stock and will have the right to appoint representative to the Maxwell's board of directors. Additionally, SDIC will be subject to an 18 month lockup period in which they will be unable to sell the stock and a 36 month standstill period in which they will be limited in purchasing additional ownership of Maxwell without our approval. We intend to use the proceeds from the investments for normal operating activities. For the agreement, the funds are to be used for strategic development as well as working capital and general corporate purposes.
With this strengthening of our balance sheet, we plan to make incremental investments in select technology development programs including our dry battery electrode technology development program where we see substantial future opportunities. Now I will turn the call back to Franz for closing comments.
Franz Fink
Thanks, Dave. Over the last three years, the team at Maxwell has been working hard to assemble the pieces of a strategy with a fundamental goal to create profitable long-term growth, diversify the business, and ultimately generate value for our shareholders. I feel that the main components of the strategy for high voltage ultracapacitors and dry battery electrode are in place and now we are focused on executing that strategy.
Make no mistake, we still have work to do but I feel confident that Maxwell is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead of us. I am looking forward to updating you in future quarters on the progress we will have made. Operator, we are now ready to open the call up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jeff Osborne from Cowen.
Jeff Osborne
Congratulations on the strong results and outlook. Just a couple of questions on my end. I wanted to better understand the dynamics that play with the fourth quarter potential, kind of mini surge it sounds like, of bus. Is the gating factor the factory that CRRC is building or qualification with customers, product from that plant. I just want to understand what the dynamics are to see that potential happen.
Franz Fink
Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Let me start a little bit more broadly just to re-emphasize that what we are seeing here is that the localization strategy and agreement we have been putting in place is working. As of this, while we are in the midst like Dave pointed out, bringing up the factory, getting through certification, bus customers have been coming back to us and asking our help in helping them developing optimized solutions. In the short term that certainly would be with the existing products, in the midterm what they have been telling us, that as subsidies go away in 2019, we believe that the ideal solution is plug-in hybrids with ultracapacitors or even electric vehicles protected by ultracapacitors.
Now again, that requires more in the mid to long term optimized solutions. Now as far as your fourth quarter question is concerned, certainly there is demand with respect to building buses. There is quite some pressure, system cost and system cost pressure with respect to that, that on the one hand looking at solutions leveraging more costly power batteries versus on the other hand combining cheaper energy batteries with ultracapacitors. And in that context of course we are looking into what can we do to help them on the one hand from optimizing the system from an overall cost ultracapacitor system cost standpoint and then of course, yes, to your point, bringing up the factory and getting the certification of course needs to be happening in a timely fashion too.

And that’s why as of today, while this is all happening and we are seeing here some encouraging signals, we have some work to do. And of course we also are very carefully looking into what conditions should we take on that short-term business that is based on existing products to get back into those systems to set up really a more healthy and a bigger business in the mid to long term. And again, at this point in time, we remain on the conservative side like we have done in the last quarter but wanted to let you all out there know that there is really encouraging signs that there might be a short-term upside opportunity but particularly in working in the mid to long-term opportunity as well.
Jeff Osborne
That’s helpful. And just to, I guess to make sure I understood what I think you are trying to emphasize on the prepared remarks that the upside in revenue, while it may be dilutive to gross margins but still target the breakeven EBITDA so there wouldn’t be any risk to that, if this were to happen, but essentially the 30% target for gross margins will be the issue.
Franz Fink
Yes. Right. We would be prepared to go as aggressive in view of the mid to long term very healthy business to some of the gross margin but not breakeven EBITDA levels, yes.
Jeff Osborne
Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And then just as we think about '18, I know you are not giving formal guidance but with those dynamics at play for buses ahead of the subsidy expiration in '19, I would imagine that would be quite strong. I guess just how would you encourage the investors to think about the margin profile of that business with the CRRC plant up and running in '18? Is there going to be like a second generation of products that might be more cost optimized for China which then would improve the margins or would the bus make still be a drag on gross margins but obviously a big boom to top line and EBITDA.
Franz Fink
I would look at this [administer] [ph] conservatively only from a standpoint, we obviously involve developing with our partners next generation products. We are trying to get them out as early as possible. However, you know on how those things could go. Not necessarily, even on our side, new buses with optimized systems need to be developed. If they would come into play by end of '18 would be great but if they move into 2019, that certainly could have meant to. In that context, I would look as an investor that we would be prepared to take on here business again in the context that it might be impacting gross margins but clearly contributing to cash flow and EBITDA as we go through 2018.
As far as the significance of said revenue is concerned. Again, we pointed out earlier in the call, we have more to share in the next earnings call but as just initial fuel, we would like to look at this more on the conservative side and not get too excited yet at this point in time.
Jeff Osborne
That makes sense. Maybe just a couple of modeling questions. Assuming the SDIC deal goes through, are the mechanics of that, that total $47 million of cash roughly would show up at the end of Q3 and then we should think about a Q4 share count, kind of in the $43 million to $45 million range. I am just trying to understand what the dynamics are as we model that out.
David Lyle
Yes, depending on -- this is Dave, Jeff. Depending on when we close will determine the weighted average share count. But you are right, I think by the time we enter Q4, if we close this in Q3, we will be in the $44 million share range. In terms of the cash inflow of $47 million, it's gross and it also could be subject to some small adjustments depending on where the share price is at that time. But generally speaking, $47 million is what we are shooting for and then there is some transaction cost we will have to pay out of that.

Jeff Osborne
And then shall we assume -- assuming the Swiss subsidiary runs at this level throughout the year or maybe moderate growth at the tax rate, or the tax expense, sorry, of $1.2 million a quarter. Should that be consistent throughout the year every quarter or is there any ups and downs on that.
David Lyle
I think it depends on the quarterly revenue but I think generally speaking in the million dollar range per quarter is kind of a good model.
Jeff Osborne
Got you. And then is there any way Franz that you can talk about roughly outside the stop start, how many vehicles you expect to exit '17 on the road, and the '18 on the road. I fully recognize the 14 design wins or revenue opportunity late in '18 and any more in the '19 but is there any, just based on your understanding, how many vehicles you will exit this calendar year that have launched and exiting '18 that have launched.
Franz Fink
Yes, I think just at a high level, out of course the platforms we have been mentioning, there is a few of them in '17. There is clearly, I would say, the remainder of those few going towards half of the 14 towards end of '18. Maybe a little bit more and then the other one into early '19 and in '19. That’s how I would look at that at a high level.
Jeff Osborne
Okay. That’s helpful. And then I assume there is no update on this, that’s my last question, but you haven't mentioned on the past couple of calls, Corning, and the development work there. Is there any update there, assuming no since you didn’t mention it, but when should investors expect some type of update or commercialization of a potential product or testing that you could share.
Franz Fink
Yes. Very good question, Jeff. We are still making good progress there on the technology front and on that front generally. So a higher capacitance and a higher temperature is likely, as pointed out in the past, in development. And we will have updates there in the not too distant future. It might not be next quarter but it's progressing nicely and it's still very critical technology for, particularly for automotive but not solely for automotive.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.
Franz Fink
All right. Well, again, thank you all for joining today. Dave and I are looking forward talking to all of you here over the next hours and days to come. And again, we are going to attend the Cowen conference at 31st of May in New York. So there is opportunities to meet with many of you hopefully there. Thanks for joining and your interest in Maxwell. Thank you very much.

I would now like to turn the call over to Franz.
Franz Fink
Welcome and thank you for joining us this afternoon. On today's call, we will review our third quarter 2016 financial performance and discuss our business outlook. Starting with our third quarter results, we achieved revenue of $25.5 million with non-GAAP growth margin of 30.5%. The timely completion of all aspects of the worldwide organizational restructuring we announced last year, along with our continued focus on increasing operational efficiencies allowed us to make another large improvement in our operating expenses to $12.5 million.
Also, we met our financial objectives for the quarter. Revenue and profitability remain a challenge during the transition of our business in the near term, is continued on certainty remained in both the China bus and wind markets.
On our last earnings call, we shared with you a number of critical strategic initiatives we prioritized to help us navigate through these near-term challenges and to transition our business to a very large long-term higher growth market opportunity.
We have identified manufacturing and supply connections that will further streamline our business and improve our cost structure in the future. We are diversifying our bus and wind product lines into other markets and we are working to establish a strategic partnership with a large brand name market leader to better position us in China.
We are also expanding our portfolio's strategic development partnerships to ensure we sufficiently invest in our innovation engine to expand our technology platform, to build and expand in sales pipeline and ultimately drive accelerated business growth.

We also shared more information about our new dry battery electrode technology that we believe has ability to drive further business diversification and if successful, has the potential to analog new applications, address a significant market opportunity and change the technological landscape for new target markets as we move rapidly forward into a more electrified world.
We achieved our financial objectives in the third quarter and I'm very pleased with the great progress we are making with our strategic initiatives to solidify and diversify our business with progress in both design and activity as well as our partnership strategy. Our confidence is growing that we have significant future growth opportunities here at Maxwell.
To that end, let me now update you on the progress we are making on our key strategic initiatives in our key addressable markets. I will discuss the following seven markets in order: China bus, auto truck, grid energy, rail, wind and high voltage. I'll start first with the China bus market.
The Chinese government has still not formally announced additional changes to its subsidy program for buses. However, on the positive front we have recently received demand inquiries from several of our China bus customers for both our 48-volt as well as our new 54-volt bus modules based on our new 3-volt technology. As we are not highly confident that these will ultimately translate into deliveries in Q4, you will see that we have not reflected this revenue in our Q4 revenue guidance.
We previously disclosed that we had signed an MOI or Memorandum of Intent with a large Chinese partner to enable us to address potential China government localization requirement and to further strengthen our position into China new energy power a storage market. We have made significant progress in solidifying that partnership agreement and believe we will sign a definitive agreement by early next year.
We expect this to reignite our China bus market revenue in 2017 and allow us to generate revenue into seasonally strong second half of the year. We are optimistic than an extended partnership combined with our technology leadership and new 3-volt phase modules positions us very well to capitalize on the growing Chinese energy storage market for bus, great rail and other applications.
Moving to the auto market. We still believe this market holds the greatest long-term growth opportunity for our ultracapacitors and we remain confident that the market inflection point is in the 2018 time frame. The electrification of functions and internal combustion engine cars such as powering electric turbo chargers, eActive suspension and start stop which includes emergency backup systems has increasing power demands, many of which we believe cannot be supported reliably by batteries alone.
Our work with OEMs and Q1 suppliers in developing solutions for multiple platforms is beginning to show promising results. We have a total of 11 car model designs at various stages of progress and for various applications. Several of those have already launched and others are at a stage where ultracapacitor technology has been proven and platform development is under way. We now have four auto design wind shifting in volume and seven additional auto designed winds that are targeting launches between now and 2019.
We believe that by 2020 we will have at least 10 to 15 car model design winds generating meaningful revenue from Maxwell. Let's review these designs and applications in more detail. First is the start stop application. We have design winds with PSA, Cadillac ATS, Cadillac CTS and Cadillac CT6. Those are going well and provide a steady revenue base. Second, we are seeing very good traction with Maxwell ultracapacitors and eActive suspension applications for new car model designs. As a reminder the eActive suspension application using Maxwell ultracapacitors is mainly targeted at Active Roll Control or ARC which delivers automatic individual wheel control over bumpy surfaces for riding comfort, improve body control and improve chassis response making handling easier on any road condition.

We are very excited about our existing design winds for eActive suspension as well as recent design activities underway. Each of these designs begins in the lower volume 48-volt system luxury auto segment of the market. We previously announced that we had a design wind launch this year as a standard option in a very small volume high end luxury SUV. More recently our partners have seen design wind activities which are giving us increasing confidence in the proliferation of the eActive suspension application using Maxwell ultracapacitors.
We have recently won two additional car model designs in low volume 2017 model year luxury sedans as an upgrade option. One began shipping last month and one will begin shipping next year. In addition to the confirmed design winds I just mentioned, we now have strong indications that two additional car models are planned to include this feature as an upgrade option for launch in late 2017 or 2018. Furthermore, there are three additional design evaluations under way for lower priced higher volume 2019 or 2020 models with the possibility to be a standard feature in one or more of those models.
As with eActive suspension we are also seeing continued momentum with our designing activities for power-challenging application that I have shared with you on previous calls – electric turbos or e-turbo solutions. As the global auto OEMs are facing significant challenges to meet very stringent future mission regulations, they are accelerating their development efforts to increase electrification across their fleets.
We are very excited about the traction we have with several customer projects aimed at downsizing the internal combustion engine and complementing it with an electrified turbo charger in order to maintain the engine performance while significantly lowering fuel consumption and emissions. We have been working very closely with our OEM and tier-1 partners to develop a cost-efficient energy and power delivery solution for this very power demanding application and I am cautiously optimistic that we should be able to share more about the progress we are making with this application as we move to the evaluation and validation phases.
This broad-based progress and design activity highlights our increasing confidence that Maxwell has a strong value proposition for the automotive market and we continue to expect this will drive additional growth beginning late 2018 or early 2019 and in a much larger way by 2020.
Turning to truck. With Kenworth, Peterbilt and the third major OEM as our engine start module partners, we are seeing a modest uptake in revenue. However, due to the fragmented and diverse truck market, we continue to believe that the revenue contribution from truck will be small until a significant number of fleets have gone through the independent qualifications and the aftermarket is sufficiently penetrated.
Now turning to grid. Maxwell's pilot projects continue to make progress in demonstrating the power capability and long-term reliability of ultracapacitors as a great energy storage solution either alone or as part of a system along this battery-based energy storage. In Q4, we anticipate the commissioning of an additional pilot system to form solar output on a commercial micro grid in conjunction with Bosh and the California energy commission.
More importantly we are excited to now see the launch of our first large scale development effort with a major global OEM to address transmission level power quality issues and anticipate a growing pipeline of project as a results of the success in the coming years. Given the typical long deployment cycles we believe 2018 will be the revenue inflection point for this opportunity in multiple project and we expect that a number of commercial projects will gradually increase in 2019 and beyond.

As our opportunity pipeline grows, we are making excellent progress and bringing the technical and financial benefits of ultracapacitor energy storage to commercial reality and believe that our great product lines has the potential to become a significant contributor in the three to five-year horizon.
Turning to our rail markets. Last month we announced that Maxwell ultracapacitors are being used for regenerative breaking energy storage in the Beijing subway system. The first commercial subway wayside project for CRRC-SRI and Mexico and China. Additionally, our partnership with CRRC-SRI to co-develop solutions uniquely designed to address a rapidly growing Chinese rail market continues to progress in other areas as well.
Earlier today we announced that with our partners CRRC-SRI, we have developed the next generation cost-efficient energy storage solution with the power characteristic of an ultracapacitor combined with enhanced energy storage capacity called an L-Cap or lithium capacitor. CRRC-SRI has won an L-Cap design for trolleys with one of the world's largest make of train solutions for an on-board energy storage product.
The first demonstration trolleys have successfully completed initial test for the Changsha subway in Changsha Hunan and volume shipments are expected to ramp next year. Although this is not a large volume opportunity by itself, it is validation of our product and we expect to proliferate into further commercial opportunities beginning in 2018. We are excited about this new technology as it further broadens our technology platform and we see additional long term growth opportunities in industrial automation.
Moving to the wind market. Although we have seen near-term challenges from our largest revenue market in China due to recent government intervention, a number of new designs utilizing ultracapacitors have come to markets and we are seeing an increasing trend for large offshore and remote wind turbines that require extended life and reduced maintenance. The Chinese government's recent initiatives will put pressure on our wind revenue continuing into Q4 and possibly 2017 due to grid capacity constraints and to meet for improved infrastructure to support and deliver power when needed.
However, we continue to expect the wind market to remain one of our most material revenue contributors in 2016 and we are actively pursuing new opportunities and designs with global leaders outside of China to diversify our wind business and to drive additional growth in 2017 and beyond.
Lastly, our high voltage revenue has picked up momentum and we saw strong sales throughout the quarter, largely driven by the increased infrastructure investment by the Chinese government that was announced as part of its new five-year plan back in March. We expect revenue from our high voltage capacitor products to continue to be a material revenue and cash flow contributor to our business.
Shifting to progress on our dry battery electrode technology development that we shared in our last call, we are gaining confidence that this technology can provide a foundation to open up a new market and drive long term growth. We are adapting our proprietary dry electrode technology primarily to focus on next generation batteries for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
By applying our fundamental dry electrode manufacturing technology to lithium ion batteries, we can create significant performance and cost benefits for the market. With the automotive industry on the verge of a paradigm shift towards electrification, global players and automotive and battery industry are seeking differentiators to set them apart as leaders in this new frontier. We now have agreements with two major auto market players and several parties continue to evaluate our technology. Previously, we announced that we signed the 12 months joint development agreement with one of the world's leading automotive OEMs to develop a proof-of-concept that if successful, could lead to the world's first electric drive train based on our technology targeting 2021 automotive platform launch.

We are working in this jointly-funded program with our partner to complete proof-of-concept around electric vehicle design and expect to enter into a broader collaboration and commercialization agreement if the concept is proven in 2017. The program is progressing well and together with our partner, we reach an important first milestone in accordance with the plan. Furthermore, we are excited to announce that we are expanding to two-party agreement to include an third-party a leading global Tier 1 auto supplier who will join us on this strategic profile. This further validates the technology as a potential game changer in the industry. And the address is a significant new market opportunities, as automotive industry most rapidly forward into a more electrified growth. 
Before I turn the call over to Dave, let me reiterate that are focused efforts to advance our business diversification strategy, in the transition to higher growth opportunities is progressing well. Even as we sustain to income revenue challenges. We have made significant progress in solidifying key partnerships. Some of which we expect to be formally announced early next year. Which we expect will position us for resumed revenue growth in the second half of 2017 and beyond. 
We believe we have some right new products, innovations and partnerships that will deliver significant value for our customers and our shareholders, in the years ahead. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Dave to discuss our financial results. Dave?
David Lyle
Thanks, Frank. Third quarter revenue was $25.5 million within our guidance range of $24 million to $27 million. And down sequentially by $8.6 million. As the Chinese government slowdown in wind turbine installations impact in the quarter. Ultracapacitor revenue was $14 million and high voltage capacitor revenue was $11.5 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 30.5% within our guidance range at 29% to 32% and about flat with Q2. Q3 non-GAAP gross margin excludes $150,000 stock based compensation expense. Non-GAAP operating expense for Q3 was $12.5 million a $900,000 sequential decrease. And within our guidance range of $12.5 million to $12.9 million. 
Approximately half of the improvement in operating expenses was due to the absence in Q3 of operating expenses associated with our microelectronics product line. Which was sold in Q2. And about half was due to continue belt tightening measures internally and R&D funding for dry battery electrode partners. 
Q3 non-GAAP operating expense excludes $950,000 of stock based compensation expense. And approximately $110,000 in legal fees associated with the ongoing SEC-SCPA investigations. Other expenses about $90,000 for the quarter. And Q3 adjusted EBITD was $2.3 million negative. And unadjusted EBITDA was $3.5 million negative. 
Q3 tax expense was $820,000. Q3 non-GAAP net loss was $5.6 million resulting in a net loss per share of $0.18 based on a basic share count of approximately 32 million shares. GAAP net loss was $6.9 million for the quarter, GAAP net loss per share was $0.21.
Our Q3 cash balance was about $28 million. And we expect the cash balance to be back in the $30 million range in Q4 as working capital changes normalize. CSOs for the third quarter were 67 days an inventory terms were 2 times. 
Now I'd like to provide guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016. Q4 we expect Maxwell's top line revenue to again be in the range of $24 million to $27 million. This guidance range assumes no revenue contribution from China bus in Q4 as our customers are still waiting to receive formal guidance from the Chinese government. 
In the case where a positive statement is issued in Q4. We could see up to a $5 million upside to our guidance range from China bus revenue. However, we are taking a conservative stance and have not included any China bus revenue in the guidance range. 

We expect our high voltage revenue to increase by approximately $2 million sequentially into offset sequential declines from old capacitors and the China when market as we enter a seasonally soft quarter. 
We expect non-GAAP gross margin for Q4 be down slightly versus Q3 in the range of 27% to 30%. As we expect sequentially lower utilization in our ultracapacitor factory to be somewhat offset in a more favorable next shift toward our high voltage product line. 
We anticipate excluding from Q4 non-GAAP gross margin $150,000 in stock based compensation expense. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expense to be in the range of $12.3 million to $12.7 million. We estimate our Q4 non-GAAP operating expense would exclude approximately $1.3 million in stock based compensation expense. And $200,000 of legal costs associated with the SEC and SCPA matters. 
We expect our tax expense in Q4 to be about $900,000 mostly associated with taxes on income from our Swiss subsidiary. At the midpoint of guidance, Q4 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be about $2.7 million negative. And unadjusted EBITDA expected to be $4.3 million negative. 
At the midpoint of guidance, we expect a cue for non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.19 based on a basic share count of about 32 million shares. GAAP net loss per share at the midpoint of guidance is expected to be $0.24. With regard to our cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter, we expect cash to be up from Q3 at about $30 million depending on working capital changes. 
Taking a high level look at 2017. We believe that we will continue to feel pressure through the first half of 2017. Mainly because a typical seasonal softness in both the China bus and win market. We expect that our agreement with a large local partner coupled with customer adoption of our new products, We'll drive revenue growth in the China bus market in the second half of 2017. 
Wind market revenue should seasonally resume in the second quarter of 2017. However we expect that annual revenue maybe down overall. Additionally, Auto will continue to remain a solid and meaningful revenue contributor as we prepare for additional growth in 2018 and beyond. 
We expect grid and rails to both grow nominally in 2017. And begin an inflection point in 2018. In summary, we continue to work through near term challenges in China, but believe we are successfully executing on our strategy to navigate those challenges. While maintaining the long-term prospects for the company. 
Now turn the call back to Frank, for closing comments. 
Franz Fink 
Thanks Dave. The Maxwell team did a tremendous job in the third quarter executing on our mission critical initiatives that will build long-term value for our shareholders. We are excited with the progress we made in our China localization effort, when announcement is expected soon. 
Our automotive design and activities across various applications, which are gaining momentum. The first commercial development is a great market moving towards commercial ramp in 2018. The expansion of our technology platform was our first commercial real deployment, using jointly developed ultra-products with our strategic partner CRRC-SRI. And our dry battery through technology development, with a global Tier 1 joining a proof of concept agreement in further validating the game changing performance potential of our technology. 
We have a focused and motivated team in place here at Maxwell. And I remain very excited about the opportunities ahead. I look forward to working with the team as we execute our strategy. With the ultimate goal of maximizing value for our shareholders. 
Operator we are now ready to open the call up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead your line is open. 

Noah Kaye
Thank you, and good afternoon. Just wanted to just want to make sure to sort of that we understood the implications of your comments on the revenues cadence. So are you basically seeing under this first half of 2017 really a drop of revenue in the business? Should we start to see revenue growth in adjusted -- into '18? And how confident are you that some of these auto designs programs are going to be the key driver there, or are you assuming a significant recovery -- interesting then demand for China bus as we look into 2018?
Franz Fink 
Yes, I know I thanks for the question, let me clarify and start with 2017, all what we are saying is said as you know seasonally in first quarter with this Chinese New Year, and even in second quarter a China bus is always very low ended seasonally strong and in third and fourth quarter, and we need is obviously seasonally soft in fourth quarter and first quarter, and stops to ramp into second quarter and third quarter. So, that's all what we try to say with our comment that obviously we'd be moving in first and second quarter into those quarters with some of our key businesses are seasonally softer, the other businesses, of course automotive like Dave pointed out rail and grit remain very solid throughout, and now coming to 2017, sorry 2018. Like I pointed out in the call today there is multiple things that are coming into play certainly excellent traction we have in automotive market, so first large scale development project is a global industrial yam [ph]. 
On a grit firming capability that combines batteries with ultracapacitors, that will start to roll out in 2017 and going to its first commercial deployment, these obviously several opportunities in 2018 and then gradually, so opportunities will in increase from there. Similarly with our programs you're making in rail, we will see here an initial ramp with our new technology in 2017, and that will gradually continue to increase in 2018. As far as to wind market is concerned, I would like to emphasize said we have been focusing outside of China, we have been here securing design wins in U.S. as well as in Europe which key players, not just for new wind terms turbines, but we also stopping to see some interesting momentum this retrofits, we operators in order to lower and maintenance costs are stopping to look into replacing batteries, with ultracapacitor solutions, and this obviously provide an additional growth opportunity for us.
As far as China bus is concerned, just to also compliment here the markets. We are moving ahead with the localization, despite the fact that the Chinese government has not announced a new subsidy, this is going extremely well, again as you pointed out we expect to hear an announcement early next year, and in parallel we have started with our partners to put everything in place from the new products we have developed qualifying those new products, establishing infrastructure from manufacturing to customer facing activities, subset as subsidies communicated, we are prepared with or without localization requirements to rolled out our new products in 2017, to make sure that as the market obviously stops to grow into seasonally strong quarters Q3 and Q4, we are designed in with our products and to most of our bus customers we had designed in, a today are we going to past. 
Noah Kaye 
Okay, thank you very much that color. Next, may be a question on the announcement that you made today, looking that in tandem with your previous announcement about the JDA, with the other partner. Can you help with understand to what extent you are retaining of protecting your IP as we now look at taking the proprietary dry electrode from process into a new application involved, neither looking my on electrode portion in there or some combination, there're kind of traditional architecture. How are you protecting -- and are you comfortable that you can position the platform to protect that? Thank you. 

Franz Fink 
Yes, very good, an important question a lot, so let me just maybe first just a little bit draw for summarize on how those partners come here into play, I have shared on previous calls, that key OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers and even self-suppliers look at the electric drive train including energy storage solution as core of as a future electric vehicle just looked like an internal combustion engine into power train, in the car is today. In that context, our globally impact now brings all a system knowledge, including obviously building electric vehicle, here had to the party, helping us like pointed out to validate our technology in the context of an electric drive train system, that's where it's a global Tier 1 comes in, that has been obviously looking at developing electrical motors, electrical drive trains, and combining it with energy storage capability to really have differentiated capability for electric wheel vehicles and plug in hybrid electric vehicles forcing years 2020, 2021 and beyond. 
We are in that project here with our technology and we have structured that where Maxwell is set pretty much focused on underlying technology, the underlying materials and a dry battery electrode technology. As well as volume manufacturing aspect of it, and in the context of we have made sure that some agreement is structured such said that PIP, also underlying dry electrode battery a technology and manufacturing capability, and associated IP remains with Maxwell. 
David Lyle
Yes, I like just add to that and now we have [terms] of IP protection, we have over 50 patent applications worldwide on the dry electric process itself, we feel like we're well protected there, and before we announced we and started talk public more publicly about dry electrode more specifically we spent 2015 making sure that we shore up our patent portfolio as well as tested, so we feel pretty good that were protected here.
Noah Kaye 
Great, thank you I will jump back in queue.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Irwin with Roth Capital Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Craig Irwin 
Good evening and thank you for taking my questions. First of all, thank you very much for the broaden discussion of this success with [indiscernible] and a little bit more visibility on the programs that are you working on for the next few years and where you feel you're ready had the wins, so congratulations on Porsche even though I know you won't say that name. I'm and some of the other very high profile programs that are coming down the pipe. Doctor Fink, my question is about lithium ultracapacitors. My understanding is that the announcement you made today is not the only active program where you are testing product in the field, I understand there could be a couple or few, so I was hoping that you might be able to give us a little bit of color on that. 
And then, one of the things that I've been discussing with my clients, is how lithium ultracapacitors already use materials that are commoditized very similar to what's out -- what's been commoditizing that battery industry, so we won't have the same issues of very expensive carbon on the frontend and like we did a number of years ago on the introduction of ultracapacitors. Can you maybe talk through the cost structure of lithium ultracapacitors and what that means for potential market adoption rates. As we are as we look at this product potentially being commercially launch in the next couple quarters. 
Franz Fink
Yes, thanks for the question, Craig. With respect to the lithium capacitors in general in your market questions and additional projects. I will say in this call that much, as we already referred to in our call, it's clearly with our partner has one aspect of being uniquely designed and optimized for on border electrocution to hire energies efficiently enough Powered by Light weight, obviously is important but certainly that's not the only application that we are looking at. So, in that context you could guess that we are involved in various stages with the technology without the applications. I referred to some in industrial automation you also could think about a backup power capability. But at this point in time I would not like to go a year in more details.

Now, as far as cost structure is concerned. In synergy with ultracapacitor is when with battery dry electrode program that we are embarked on with our JDA [ph] partners. You can look at lithium capacitor technology as follows. As you look at one extreme its ultracapacitor was higher -- highest power but you know energy overtly density is limited. Our lithium capacitor technology basically doubles or triples the energy in the capacitor with pretty much keeping the power, not at the same level but it significant levels, more than half of the power. 
Now, as you look at particularly here the inner side of things. And what you could do to make sure that you don't have just like in like in lithium ion batteries, not the first a cycle of energy, and looking to a litigation -- pre-litigation capability and I don't want to going to more details for obvious reasons not to give a too much of a with the right process you can imagine that could be fairly easily established as we do that, we believe because we can take the lithium capacitor, and ultracapacitor capability into what you would call it generally a hybrid capacitor, that could hopefully over time as we continue to advance and innovate. Keeps the power as close to an ultracapacitor but takes the energy in such a capacitor four to five times further up on what our lithium capacitor has today. 
If you would succeed to do so. We believe that would be a capacitor that would be in the sweet spot powering 80% of applications we see in any market you could look at. And as you know cost is obviously important so we are coming there from a dry process and the cost structure, that we from a building a capacitor, or building a cell if you will from an ultracapacitor manufacturing standpoint. But as energy goes up, you need less cells for the whole energy storage solution and in doing so obviously, you could significantly lower the system cost for any of source energy storage. Systems of for any applications you target. Does that kind of answers your question?
Craig Irwin 
Yes, that does, that's very good. So then as a follow-up; many investors would love to see Maxwell profitable and making money. But your advanced technology programs like this are obviously a medium term and longer term investment. Can you maybe share with us the $20 million plus in R&D that you're spending this fiscal year, can you share with us approximately what portion of that is going to support existing ultracapacitor products, and the engineering and development of new generation on existing products. Versus some of the more advanced technology, advanced applications where we haven't sold the products in volume yet. 
Franz Fink
Craig, for obvious reasons I hope everyone on the call understands I don't want to go into too much details. But let me offer up the following. Our R&D investment is structured such if we have a very significant portion, on of course our next generation ultracapacitor technology. Like the 3-volt I can mention here's a Corning [ph] program helping us of with some of the next generation material science higher performance, lower -- higher capacitance a lower cost, high a temperature, very important for automotive programs with more to come like I shared in the last call of the next 12, 15 months. We are looking into leveraging ultracapacitor and for this matter hybrid composite of technology for all the great programs, developing here complementary energy storage capability to complement batteries just like the large scale program with a big globally as I mentioned today. 
And of course the lithium capacitor and advancement of this with our partner we're working on with our Chinese partner to further advance this. And then of course to mention and not to forget but to mention the battery dry electrodes program. So I think that what I would say is that lots of our investment is still to a significant extent on advancing ultracapacitor technology as we have significant traction here automotive wind and grit. On the other hand, we also are making sure that we with battery dry electrodes the lithium capacitor and advancement of the Hybrid capability, we are spending sufficiently enough with the help of partners but keeping the key IP at Maxwell to advance SAD1 [ph].

So, if your question then really is how much are we spending on just maintaining normal type of product. Yes as always of course some %age but I would say, we have been shifting with the focus we have put the last two years of investment on developing, so now what you started to see come out this year with this we won't know with the lithium capacitor and more to come in 2017 but really focus on so now and the future with lots of different innovative capability coming out over the next 12 to 18 month. 
Craig Irwin
Thank you for that. And then last question along this line; Maxwell has some recent experience and commissioning new manufacturing, your Arizona facility was obviously a very successful launch. And a nice impact on the company's operating cost structure, as far as being able to produce high volumes, at the right price. can you discuss whether or not they would be similar or different timelines for Maxwell to start putting production online of lithium capacitors, not just low rate production but medium or high volume production, and whether or not there are any complexities around the capital needs of the capital requirements to launch full scale production versus your experience in the Arizona facility. 
Franz Fink
Yes, Craig. We have gone into too much detail of the partnership that we announced here. And basically a year ago. We are working here with a partner that helps us to optimize the technology particularly in this case for on border real applications. And in that partnership, we are also making sure that we in line with affordability will bring up the first volume production line. And as we expand into new and additional markets beyond real, and this initial lines is basically fully utilized. We would look into in building lines that are maybe you know solely owned ultimately further down the road by Maxwell. So again, we're taking here an approach with the help of a partner have the volume capability, the right cost available can leverage that manufacturing capability and would expand beyond this as we are going into for the market beyond real. 
Craig Irwin
Great, thanks again for taking my question.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll go on and take our next question from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Jeff Osborne
Just a couple of quick ones for me. One on the dry electrode process that you're working out with the auto OEM, is that exclusive to the OEM or if you choose to proceed is there an opportunity to sell that to others. 
Franz Fink 
At this point of time, the agreement is structured offset that there is no exclusivity and the IP as I pointed out stays with Maxwell, and in that context we can pursue other opportunities. 
Jeff Osborne 
Got it. And then, you mentioned that I think that the NRU [ph] funding helped the expenses this quarter you have -- how do we think about what the funding cadences for 2017 and is there a significant amount of OpEx that's being defrayed by this that we should be thinking about as we model you gave some Context about how we should think about the cadence of the revenue ramp through the year, but any commentary on OpEx if you think this kind of you know loader to mid twelves ranges, sustainable or as revenue picks up, what the pace of OpEx increase would be helpful also. 
Franz Fink
Yes. So maybe Jeff, I make a broader -- I give a broader runs on OpEx in the context said first of all, I command team for the job they have done to get us to the level they're this today. As we are moving in to 2017 we are always continuously looking into what else we can optimize. Having this said we are looking at the right partnerships, that help us invest in our innovative products and solutions. And in doing so even though let's say more work would need to be done, we would basically keep operating expenses at let's say pretty much at current levels. What I don't want you to read into it yet again is that with the help of some of that funding, that it's just going to go right significantly down because with some of those programs additional work will come. Having this said we are very much focused to make sure our operating expenses are in the remaining control, and will do so as we're moving forward.

In context with those partnerships just an additional comment, we are very much focused here to invest in innovation engine and protective value of our products of our technology platform and to value for our shareholders. 
Jeff Osborne 
Very good, that makes a lot of sense, and the last question I have is just around the new partnership and localization in China. So just hypothetically speaking at the bus market were to come back, how do we think about the margin profile of that business with your new strategy relative to past cycles in the China bus market?
Franz Fink 
I think you should look at that such said, you should see somehow in at improved marching profile, just from a standpoint that as you take an approach where you have less one in between product being manufactured, and then ultimately bought back and resold was margins on top, to have a competitive product you could easily see, and how that puts us somehow higher margin pressure, we think we will see what the new strategies some relief, offset additional marching's stacking an ends [ph], we saying it will see somehow improved margins.
Jeff Osborne 
Make sense and maybe just one point clarification on that, what I may have missed -- there's a tremendous amount of detail on this call, but what exactly is being localized in China, I assume you're still making electrode yourself in Arizona, and then package shipped within just a final assembly that's in China?
Franz Fink 
At this point in time, what's localized is a Bus module manufacturing that at this point in time, electrode remains in Peoria Arizona, cell manufacturing is under Maxwell, was a partner in the Maxwell leadership, bus module manufacturing, we are localizing here in initial step with a partner, working very closely with them, again more to be disclosed as we would obviously share so definitive agreement, that we believe of we will be able to sign early next year.
Jeff Osborne 
And it's just so clear, Lucshane [ph] I think was your partner in the past for cells, who was making that the module in the past?
Franz Fink 
Well, we have -- we really haven't on the various partners, but system module NHLAP cells [ph] where with our partner about in china. 
Jeff Osborne 
Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll go ahead and take our next question from John [ph] question Cannacord. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, good evening, thanks for taking my question, first on the ultracapacitor revenue I guess declines on the winter by market in China, that whatever was 7 million year-on-year change or, excuse me for a quarter-on-quarter change, Q2, Q3, can you size the amount of the market that you feel is being delayed for you is that 7 million run rate per quarter, how do we think about the amount of business potentially delayed in China with us?
Franz Fink
No. John, again thanks for the question, no you cannot quite look at this because remember, we had a very -- electrode ever quarter in China wind, in that the second quarter because with that FIC a plan back in March, they announced significant additional funding and gigawatt hours coming on over the next five years in the five year plan, pins our customers were stopping to accelerate building wind turbines, just that figuring out in the middle of the second quarter that they didn't have the infrastructure to bring them all online, and of course then so co -- also had some impact additionally to slow that down in some of solution.
So in that context, our revenue was significantly higher by millions and millions in second quarter versus a normal even stronger seasonally -- seasonal strong a second quarter, so you need to really look at this said releases delta from a normalized second quarter into a third quarter, the decline is actually significantly less than that $7 million, in fact it it's actually below $5 million, I don't want to go into more detail, but that could still your flavor that it's over compounded by the fact that happens here was to flush announcement in March, overbuilding and then basically slowing it down. 

Unidentified Analyst
Okay, thank you, that's helpful. And then moving to my follow-up question; in terms of the R&D spend, I think someone touched on earlier this $5 million run rate if you will, is that static we're going to be around $5 million across the different applications you have or how should we think about this moving forward? Is this a leverage potently safe if need be in 2017, thank you. 
Franz Fink 
Yes, again thought I hoped that I can see here some conviction that team has shown that we have a focus on trading expense, and we do what needs to be done to protect the evaluation and value for shareholders. In that context I think at this point in time, yes, that how you should look at it, we will make sure that we put the company in a stronger context of partnerships like we have done, we are making progress the same; we will continue to focus on it. Now again having this said, in case we would have to look at this as we are moving forward, we certainly would look at this, and look at alternatives to make sure to protect the value of our technology platform and of our business and in that context the value of our shareholders.
Operator
Thank you. And that does conclude today's program. We'd like to thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day. You may disconnect at any time.
Franz Fink
Okay again, thanks for joining today. Looking forward to talking to all of you here in hours and days to come. Thanks for joining today, bye.
