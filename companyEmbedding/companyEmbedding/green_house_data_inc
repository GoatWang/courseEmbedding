Data Center Security

In keeping with best practices for physical security, Green House Data's data center facilities employ a four-layer approach to protect your critical infrastructure: perimeter security, facility controls, white space access, and cabinet access.
Paired with 24/7/365 visual monitoring, facilities are additionally secured by: 

Mechanical, electronic, and procedural access controls
Intrusion detection systems
Biometric scanning devices
Personnel identification procedures for all employees and visitors, and escorts for all visitors
CCTV security cameras inside and outside buildings
Double man-trap entry to data center white space
Individual locks for all colocation cages, pods, and cabinets
Fencing around data center complexes and campuses
Bulletproof glass, reinforced walls, and concrete bollards


In addition, client systems are protected by pre-action fire detection and suppression systems that include early warning air sampling, photoelectric smoke detection, and clean agent gaseous suppression. Clean agent systems are much more environmentally friendly than other suppression materials like inert gas and are just as effective.

Disaster Recovery Data Center

Low Natural Disaster Risk





Disaster Recovery Data Center — Low Risk of Natural Disasters
Hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes—how can you be sure your servers and other critical infrastructure will escape nature's wrath? With data centers located in some of the safest areas of the nation, placing your critical data a Cheyenne data center has never looked better. 
Though the average cost of an outage varies widely by your industry, in 2017, the analyst firm IDC reported that 50 percent of businesses never recover after an outage and 90 percent go out of business within two years.
Many data centers—and cloud deployments—are located in heavily populated, disaster-prone locations, like coastal regions. The maps below detail the risk of natural disasters in major metropolitan areas, including earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes. Even if one of these disasters doesn't damage the data center, it can cut power for days at a time. Be prepared. Keep your infrastructure intact.
Wyoming is one of the most reliable power grids in the country, as ranked by Eaton in their annual Blackout Tracker (PDF) report. The state reported only 16 outages in 2016, averaging just 29 minutes.

About Green House Data





Home
About





A different breed of data center.
Experience reliable IT service from a provider focused on support, community, and sustainability.
Green House Data was founded in 2007 with a simple mission: provide the high-availability and raw power needed for critical business infrastructure while remaining a transparent, responsibly run company.

Across eight data center locations spanning the country and our Cheyenne, Wyoming headquarters, Green House Data imbues our trademark data center services with exceptional support, while powering it all with renewable energy.
The day-to-day business at Green House Data is focused on three commitments:

 

Commitment to Customers
When we say “Built right. Just for you,” we’re talking about more than just custom infrastructure. This mantra drives every action across every department. If it doesn’t benefit the customer, forget it. And, we created a 15-Minute Hear from a Human SLA, so if there ever is a problem, our customers are not left waiting.
Commitment to Uptime
Whether it is IaaS, traditional colocation, or a hybrid solution, the root of our business is IT infrastructure. We’re proud to have some of the best data center designers, network architects, and system administrators around, all focused on keeping your IT running smoothly. We take our 100% uptime SLA seriously, and constantly monitor all of our sites.
Commitment to Responsible Business
We've always offered 5% of our compute space and employee time to non-profits, and in 2014, Green House Data became a B-Corp so we could even better hold ourselves accountable to the environment, our staff, our shareholders, and the community around us.
Every employee knows the financial status and growth strategy of the company. Everyone, from top executive to brand-new employee, is encouraged to volunteer and provide services to non-profits. And of course there’s our dedication to energy-efficiency and green power, too.

Best Practices for Data Center Migration
4 Steps to Budget Your Planning
FROM THE GREEN HOUSE DATA KNOWLEDGE CENTER
























We did consider Amazon and Azure, but it was the personal touch in working with Green House Data that was the biggest driver.
AssociationVoice








We get big-time infrastructure benefits for a fraction of the cost. Plus, Green House Data’s core competency is data center management. We need our data centers to be up 100 percent of the time, and colocation provides that.
Black Hills Energy








Green House Data supports us in our mission to operate in a socially responsible and sustainable way by providing high quality environmental services and employing common-sense sustainable business practices.
Trihydro








The high touch has worked really well for us. This and the overall value of the company and service offer a cost-benefit that makes a lot of sense.
