 Letter to Investors to Accompany Investor Choice Tender Notice 
� Dear Investors,

Last quarter, we shared with you our intention to develop a plan to allow you to choose among several options involving your investment in The Endowment Fund.
Over the last several months, we have worked with intermediaries, liquidity providers, and regulatory authorities to deliver on that plan. We are happy to announce that this letter accompanies a tender offer form that will allow you to choose the
option that is right for you and your investment portfolio.
 In accordance with the plan we have developed, you have a choice among three options. You may
also select a mix of these options, allocating portions of your investment across the different strategies.
 Option 1: Remain
invested in The Endowment Fund, an actively managed core alternatives vehicle with a focus on difficult-to-access and niche alternative strategies with low correlation to equities. This is the default option � if you do not make an election,
you will stay invested in the actively managed fund.  Option 2: Enter into a liquidating fund (referred to as the Passively Managed
Fund, or PMF) that will distribute cash as the underlying assets of the current portfolio are liquidated. We expect that process to take up to ten years. If you choose this option, you would tender your interest in The Endowment Fund in exchange for
shares in the PMF. We refer to this process as the TEF tender offer. Investors who wish to participate in Option 2 must qualify as an Accredited Investor as defined in the tender offer materials.

Option 3: Sell your PMF investment for cash at a discount to NAV. The PMF Fund will offer to repurchase your shares at a discount
reflecting an agreement by the PMF Fund to sell its investment to a third-party buyer that was selected through a formal competitive bidding process. An institutional broker, Park Hill Group, LLC, was engaged to run an auction, in which thirteen
prospective buyers worked alone or together to produce seven unique bids. Under Option 3, you would first participate in the TEF tender process described in Option 2 above, and then choose to participate in PMF�s repurchase offer. PMF will
repurchase your shares based on selling its investment at a corresponding discount to the winning bidder, HarbourVest � Origami Structured Solutions L.P., at the tender offer price outlined below and in the enclosed tender offer solicitation.
We currently expect investors who elect Option 3 to receive cash payment of the net proceeds of the sale in mid-May, 2014, subject to possible extension for completion of the sale as described below. We refer to this process as the PMF early
liquidity offer.  Please be aware that events outside of the Fund�s control may impact the timing of these tender offers. The underlying general
partners (the managers of the portfolio funds in which The Endowment Fund invests) must approve the split of those investments between The Endowment Fund and the Passively Managed Fund. It is possible that a sufficient amount of the underlying
general partners may decline or defer until June�30, 2014, which would delay the transaction until that date. Additionally, there is a minimum take up condition in the PMF early liquidity offer which stipulates that in the event participation

� 1




in Option 3 is less than 20%, the transaction may not occur. In that case, investors who select Option 3 will remain invested in the Passively Managed Fund. Please review the tender offer
materials carefully, as they contain important disclosures in this regard.  Please pay particular attention to the response deadlines contained in
the accompanying tender offer materials. If you do not make an election, the default will be remaining in The Endowment Fund under Option 1.

 Option 1: The Endowment Fund (Actively Managed) 
We are excited about the opportunities ahead for the actively managed Endowment Fund. We have confidence that a core alternatives strategy focused on niche
private investment funds and difficult-to-access hedge fund strategies with low correlation to equities can serve an important diversifying role in the typical investor�s public equity-oriented portfolio. We believe that the private portion of
the Fund holds a mature and varied portfolio of investments, diversified by industry, region, vintage and investment stage that could not be built or bought elsewhere. The Endowment Fund is currently positioned as follows:

Liquidity will be provided via periodic tender offer process as approved quarterly by the Board. The first tender offer is expected to take place no earlier than 4Q2014. Future tender offers may be as frequent as
quarterly or as infrequent as annually. 


2�
Investors who elect Option 3 may expect to receive 87% of their NAV as calculated on 9/30/2013, subject to certain adjustments as described in the tender offer materials. These adjustments are currently estimated to
have a -2.3% to -3.7% impact on the price received, but may differ based on factors described in the tender offer materials. 
� 2



Beyond the current positions, we are excited about the future of the strategy as well. The actively managed
Endowment Fund will continue to seek new investment opportunities across the core alternatives spectrum. In practice, we expect the Fund to be tilted toward a mid-market approach to private markets, where we believe smaller investors are challenged
to build sufficiently diversified portfolios. The Fund is also positioned to access seeding opportunities and early-stage investments that allow Endowment Fund investors to capture more economics and reduce overall fees. Additionally, the Adviser
has made steady progress on identifying managers in the hedge fund space who can potentially deliver returns in a lower, more fee-efficient manner.
 As
part of our commitment to and enthusiasm about the portfolio, we are also pleased to inform you that the Adviser has redeemed the interest formerly held by Morgan Creek Capital Management. The Adviser is now wholly-owned by Salient, and the Salient
team (as associated persons of the Adviser) has sole management of the portfolio.
 The investment team is experienced and benefits from a variety of
backgrounds. Chief Investment Officer, Lee Partridge, served in an executive role for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, one of the largest public pension plans in the country. Chief Risk Officer, Ben Hunt, was formerly an equity long/short
portfolio manager. Portfolio Manager, Bill Enszer, has run multi-manager portfolios for Salient for several years, and did so previously at Redstone Asset Management, as well. Deputy Chief Investment Officer, Rusty Guinn, was the Director of Texas
Teachers� $12 billion Strategic Partnerships program, a multi-asset portfolio spanning a similar range of public and private investments. Director of Investments, Todd Centurino, was the Portfolio Manager for Texas Teachers� multi-billion
dollar equity market neutral and long/short equity portfolios. These professionals are supported by a team of ten investment and due diligence professionals in the management of The Endowment Fund and the other more than $2 billion in alternative
investments overseen by Salient and its affiliates.  In summary, we believe that the actively managed Endowment Fund, focused on difficult-to-access and
niche alternative strategies with low correlation to equities, led by a team of experienced investment professionals, continues to serve as a viable core alternative allocation in investors� portfolios. 
You should read carefully the updated Private Placement Memorandum of The Endowment Fund included in your tender offer materials prior to making a decision
as to whether to remain invested in The Endowment Fund. If you take no action, you will remain invested in The Endowment Fund by default. Your investment will not be discounted in any way. 
Option 2: The Passively Managed Fund (Long Term Wind-Down) 
Investors who elect the Passively Managed Fund will receive an approximately pro rata portion of the portfolio they own through their investment in The
Endowment Fund as of the closing date. Unlike Option 1, however, the Passively Managed Fund will include no new investments and will emphasize providing investor liquidity over time. Investors in the PMF should expect the following:

�


�
�
�
As soon as practicable after the acceptance of interests for purchase in the tender offer, the Adviser will seek to redeem all underlying funds for which it is possible to do so. For underlying funds with lock-up
periods, redemptions will be submitted as soon as it is possible. We expect that this will accelerate liquidity of a significant portion of the hedge fund portfolio in 2014. 
� 3





�
�
�
Any distributions of capital or redemptions from underlying managers will be distributed to investors on a quarterly basis, subject to the Fund holding up to 5% in cash to back future capital commitments, a minimum
quarterly distribution of $10 million, and payment of fees and expenses associated with the Fund. We expect that complete liquidation of the PMF will take up to 10 years. 
�


�
�
�
The Fund must continue to honor commitments of capital to private markets funds; other than funding these investments and cash management, no new investments will be made. 
Option 3: Early Liquidity Offer (Cash at Closing)  As
noted above, we developed an option for shareholders to fully and quickly liquidate their investment as part of a tender offer. Investors who choose to participate in Option 3 would be able to fully liquidate their TEF holdings in the coming months.
 The process would include (1)�participating in the TEF tender offer that exchanges TEF interests for PMF interests, and (2)�participating in
the PMF early liquidity offer, in which PMF will purchase those PMF shares for cash. Please see the enclosed tender solicitation materials for a complete description of that offer and the related process. 
�


�
�
�
As noted in the enclosure, the cash price to be paid in the PMF early liquidity offer will be calculated on the basis of TEF�s September�30, 2013 net asset value. The reason for the September�30 NAV
�as of� date is that the competitive bidding process required significant lead time for due diligence, bidding, regulatory matters, and contract negotiation. 
�


�
�
�
This purchase price will be subject to adjustments based on cash flows out of The Endowment Fund between September�30, 2013 and the closing date of the transaction and certain expenses of the transaction. Please
carefully review the tender offer materials to understand each of these adjustments and our estimates of their potential impact on proceeds.  �


�
�
�
Third party purchasers are in a position to purchase interests in the Passively Managed Fund equivalent to as many interests as investors wish to sell to PMF in the PMF early liquidity offer. If you wish to tender your
entire interest (or a portion thereof) at the PMF early liquidity, you may do so.  �


�
�
�
The cash proceeds from this option are expected to be paid out in mid-May, 2014, subject to possible extension for completion of the sale. 
As you consider each of these options, we urge you to thoroughly review the tender offer materials, including supplemental disclosures of portfolio
positions, to make your decision among these options. Consider in particular certain potential tax implications. Selling your interest at a discount in accordance with Option 3 does not necessarily mean that it will be treated as a capital loss,
since your account may still have accrued unrealized gains over the full investment period. For those who elect Option 3, you should expect a tax estimate in April, subject to possible extension for completion of the sale, and final�K-1s in
2015.  Investors are advised to read the Fund�s tender offer statement when it is available because it contains important information.
Investors are further advised that they can obtain the tender offer statement and other filed documents free of charge at the Securities and Exchange Commission�s web site (www.sec.gov). In addition, the Fund will send investors copies of the
tender offer statement and related documentation free of charge.

��Rule 17j-1 Code of Ethics of Endowment Advisers, L.P.��

Endowment Advisers, L.P. 
Code of Ethics  �


1.1
Introduction   This Code of Ethics (the �Code�) has been formally
adopted by the COC of Endowment Advisers, L.P. (�the Adviser� or the �Firm�), and shall be effective on October�1, 2011. The Code shall serve as the Code of Ethics required by Rule 204A-1 (promulgated under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940) and Rule 17j-1 (promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and is applicable to all �supervised persons� (as defined in Exhibit A) of the Firm. The CCO of the Firm, (except as specifically
noted herein) shall be responsible for maintaining and enforcing this Code.
 In our efforts to ensure that the Adviser maintains and
enhances its reputation for integrity and high ethical standards, it is essential not only that the Firm and its supervised persons comply with all relevant federal and state securities laws, but also that we maintain high standards of personal and
professional conduct. This Code is designed to help ensure that we conduct our business consistent with these high standards, and incorporates the primary principles of fiduciary duty, integrity and professionalism that are the guiding principles of
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.
 �


1.2
Standards of Business Conduct  As a registered investment adviser, the Firm and
its supervised persons owe a fiduciary duty to our clients that require each of us to place the interests of our clients ahead of our own interests. A critical component of our fiduciary duty is to avoid and/or disclose potential conflicts of
interest. Accordingly, all supervised persons must avoid activities, interests, and relationships that might interfere or appear to interfere with making decisions in the best interests of our advisory clients. Please bear in mind that a conflict of
interest can arise even if there is no financial loss to our clients and regardless of the supervised person�s motivation.  The Code
is designed to address and avoid potential conflicts of interest relating to personal trading and related activities and is based on three underlying principles:
 �


A.
We must at all times place the interests of our advisory clients first. In other words, as a fiduciary you must scrupulously avoid serving your own personal interests ahead of the interests of the Firm�s
advisory clients.  �


B.
We must make sure that all personal securities transactions are conducted consistent with this Code and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest or any abuse of an individual�s
position of trust and responsibility.  �


C.
Investment advisory personnel should not take inappropriate advantage of their positions. The receipt of investment opportunities, perquisites, or gifts greater in value than $100, from persons seeking to do
business with the Adviser, could call into question the exercise of your independent judgment and are not allowed.  The Code
contains a number of �requirements� and procedures relating to personal trading by the Adviser�s access persons and their families. It is your responsibility to become familiar with the Code and abide by the Code. Violations of the
Code will be 
�









�

�
Exhibit B



taken seriously and could result in sanctions against the violator, which sanctions can include termination of employment. Further, violations of the Code may constitute violations of federal
and/or state laws and may require reporting to the proper authorities upon discovery.
 The Code specifically prohibits the following:

�


�
�
�
Guarantees Against Loss  No supervised person may guarantee a client or investor against
losses with respect to any securities transactions or investment strategies.
 �


�
�
�
Guarantees or Representations as to Performance  No guarantee may be made that a
specific level of performance will be achieved or exceeded on or by a future date. Any mention of an investment�s past performance or value must include a statement that it does not necessarily indicate or imply a guarantee of future
performance or value.  �


�
�
�
Sharing in Profits or Losses  No supervised person may share in the profits or losses of
a client�s account except with the prior written approval of and under such conditions or restrictions as may be required by the CCO.  �


�
�
�
Borrowing From or Lending to a Client  No supervised person may borrow funds or
securities from, or lend funds or securities to, any client of the Firm without written approval of the CCO.
 �


�
�
�
Acting as Custodian or Trustee for Client or Investor  No supervised person may act as
custodian of securities, money or other funds or property of a client (or investor) or act or serve as a trustee of any client. [Any exceptions must be approved by the CCO.]

Whether or not a specific provision of the Code addresses a particular situation, you must conduct your personal trading activities in
accordance with the general principles contained in the Code and in a manner that is designed to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest.

Because governmental regulations and industry standards relating to personal trading and potential conflicts of interest can change over time,
the Adviser reserves the right to modify any or all of the policies and procedures set forth in this Code. Any material change to this Code must first be approved by the COC of the Firm.

Should the Adviser revise the Code, you will receive written notification and a copy of such amendment(s) from the CCO. It is your
responsibility to familiarize yourself with any modifications to the Code.
 By accepting and/or continuing your employment with the Firm,
you have agreed to be bound by this Code. If you have any questions about any aspect of the Code, or if you have questions regarding application of the Code to a particular situation, contact the CCO.

�


1.3
Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations  All supervised persons are required
to follow the federal securities laws (as defined in Exhibit A), state securities laws, rules, regulations and internal policies governing the Firm�s operations and advisory business. The Adviser insists on strict compliance with

�









�
2
�
Exhibit B



the spirit and the letter of these laws and regulations. Because the Adviser�s reputation is an important asset and because the Firm is judged by the conduct of its supervised persons,
supervised persons must avoid not only actual impropriety but also the appearance of impropriety.  Supervised persons should seek guidance
from the CCO whenever they are in doubt as to the applicability of any law, rule or regulation regarding any contemplated course of action. The Firm holds information and training sessions to promote compliance with federal and state securities
laws, rules and regulations. Supervised persons should consult the various guidelines and policies which the Firm has prepared in accordance with specific laws and regulations. A good guideline, if in doubt on a course of action, is �Ask first,
act later�. If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek guidance from the Chief Compliance Officer before you act.  �


1.4
Securities Holdings and Transaction Reports  All �access
persons� (as defined in Exhibit A) must submit to the Compliance Officer or his designee their personal securities holdings and transaction reports for any �reportable security� (as defined in Exhibit A) in which
the access person had, or acquires, any direct or indirect �beneficial ownership� (as defined in Exhibit A). An access person is presumed to be a beneficial owner of securities that are held by any immediate family members
sharing the access person�s household. The CCO shall maintain, and attach to the Code, a current list identifying all access persons of the Firm. [Please see Exhibit B(1)] 
�


A.
Securities Holdings Reports:  In order to address potential conflicts of interest that can
arise when an access person disposes of a reportable security acquired prior to his or her association with the Adviser and to help ensure compliance with the Code, all access persons must submit to the CCO or his designee a list of all securities
holdings (the �Holdings Report�) (other than interests in Exempted Transactions discussed below) and a list of all brokers, dealers and/or banks where they maintain a securities account. This Holdings Report must be submitted within ten
(10)�days of commencing employment (or otherwise becoming an access person) and updated annually thereafter. Endowment Advisers is
sensitive to access persons� privacy concerns and will endeavor not to unnecessarily disclose the contents of an access person�s Holdings Report.  �


B.
Quarterly Securities Transaction Reports:  Under Rule 204A-1 (with certain exceptions discussed
below) all access persons must submit a Quarterly Securities Transaction Report covering all reportable securities with the Firm within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, listing securities transactions and any new securities accounts
established at a broker-dealer or bank during the quarter, unless they are able to provide duplicate brokerage confirmations and/or statements, as described below.

�









�
3
�
Exhibit B




C.
Required Report Information:  The following information must be included in the quarterly
transaction reports described above or in the brokerage account confirmations and/or statements alternative described below:
 �


�
i.
The date of the transaction, the title and, as applicable, the exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number, interest rate and maturity date, number of shares, and principal amount of each reportable security involved;
 �


�
ii.
The nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or disposition);  �


�
iii.
The price of the security at which the transaction was effected;  �


�
iv.
The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the transaction was effected; and  �


�
v.
The date the access person submits the report.  �


Note:
If all the required information is not disclosed, then any missing information must be provided in the Quarterly Securities Transaction Report. 
�


D.
Exemptions to Reporting Requirements:  The following transactions are exempt from the quarterly
transaction reporting requirements described above. As a result, access persons are not required to submit:
 �


�
i.
Any report with respect to securities held in accounts over which the access person had no direct or indirect influence or control;  �


�
ii.
A transaction report with respect to transactions effected pursuant to an �automatic investment plan� (as defined in Exhibit�A); 
�


�
iii.
A transaction report if the report would duplicate information contained in broker trade confirmations or account statements provided to the Firm so long as the confirmations or statements are received no later than 30
days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter. [See Duplicate Brokerage Confirmations below.]  �


E.
Duplicate Brokerage Confirmations/Statements and Approved Brokerage Firms:  It is Endowment
Advisers� policy to require all access persons to provide all reportable securities transaction confirmations and statements generated by any broker-dealer(s) or bank(s) for all accounts in which any access person had or acquires any direct or
indirect beneficial ownership. It is the responsibility of each access person to ensure brokerage confirmations and statements are received by the Firm for all applicable accounts in which the access person had or acquires any direct or indirect
beneficial ownership. Endowment Advisers� internal policy also requires all access persons to hold any personal securities trading accounts with an approved broker-dealer or Salient Trust Co., our affiliates (unless a specific exception to
maintain an outside securities account has been approved by the COC and/or the CCO and documented). As noted above, an access person is presumed to be a beneficial owner of reportable securities that are held by immediate family members sharing
the access person�s household.   In the event the Firm does not receive the required brokerage confirmations and/or statements
within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter in which such transaction(s) occurred, each affected access person shall be required to complete a Quarterly Securities Transactions Report for that quarter.

Exhibit B

Exhibit B




1.6
Reporting Code Violations  As stated above, the Adviser views violations of the
Code to be a serious breach of the Firm�s rules. To ensure the Firm is made aware of any potential violations of the Code, all supervised persons are required to promptly report any existing or potential violation(s) of the Code to the CCO, or
to the COC in the event the CCO is potentially implicated in the Code violation. Failure to do so is itself a violation of the Code and subjects the offender to Code sanctions. 
The Firm will not permit retaliation of any kind by or on behalf of the Firm or its Officers against good faith reports or complaints of
violations of this Code or other illegal or unethical conduct. Any such retaliation would, in itself, be considered a violation of the Code and subject the perpetrator to Code sanctions.

The Firm encourages all supervised persons to talk to the CCO, Compliance Department Personnel and/or COC of the Firm about any observed
violations of the Code, or when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation. If the individual�s concerns require confidentiality, then this confidentiality will be protected, subject to applicable law, regulation or
legal proceedings.  The Firm maintains a toll-free Ethics Information Hotline and website, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. Supervised persons may report suspected misconduct, raise concerns about ethics or compliance matters and ask questions. Supervised persons may remain anonymous, if they wish, but should provide detailed facts about their concerns so that the
Firm can properly investigate the issue.
 Calls to the Hotline and website reports are handled by an outside company not affiliated with
the Firm to ensure objectivity, and confidentiality, to the extent possible. Details are forwarded to the Compliance and Human Resources Departments for appropriate handling. Reports to the Hotline are investigated promptly and corrective action is
taken as necessary.
 Supervised persons are expected to fully cooperate with any internal investigations regarding allegations of
misconduct and be truthful at all times. Disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, may occur for supervised persons who do not follow the Code or knowingly give a false report.

Supervised persons may contact the Ethics Information Hotline at 866.842.2171 and the website at http://salientpartners.ethicspoint.com.

�


1.7
Acknowledgement of Receipt and Certification of Compliance  The CCO or his
designee will provide every supervised person with a copy of (or access to) this Code, and any amendments made thereto, within the later of ten days of the adoption of the Code (or any amendments thereto) or within ten days of such person becoming a
supervised person of the Firm, and then annually thereafter. Each supervised person will be required to acknowledge that he or she has received, read, understands and has complied with (or in the case of a new supervised person, will comply with)
the Code and any subsequent amendments. This acknowledgement and certification of Compliance is required upon commencement of employment and annually thereafter.
