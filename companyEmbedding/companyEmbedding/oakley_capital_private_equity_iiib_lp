Peter Dubens | David Till | Oakley Capital Private Equity


























Managing Partner

Oakley Capital was founded in 2002 by Peter Dubens and David Till to make private equity investments in mid-market companies, located predominantly in Western Europe. 










Peter Dubens is the founder of Oakley and focuses on deal origination, portfolio management and Oakley Capital Private Equity’s fundraising and investor relations.

 

 
Peter is an entrepreneur. Over the last 30 years he has acquired, restructured and consolidated public and private companies, including the formation of two public companies, namely 365 Media Group plc and Pipex Communications plc. The 365 Media platform consolidated twelve businesses within the online sports information and gambling industry and the Pipex platform consolidated fourteen businesses within the telecoms and internet industries. 365 Media was sold for over £102 million to BSkyB and the main operating divisions of Pipex were sold for approximately £370 million.
In 2007, the first fund was raised and Peter launched Oakley Capital Private Equity with David Till, to be an entrepreneurially-driven UK investment house, encouraging and backing entrepreneurship. To that end, Oakley Capital Private Equity, invests in and supports the continued growth and development of some of Europe’s leading companies, including the global multimedia platform Time Out; the iconic sailing brand, North Sails; Facile, Italy’s leading price comparison website; and Parship Elite Group, a leading online dating company.

An affiliate of Bermuda private equity firm Oakley Capital Investments has agreed to acquire a majority stake in TechInsights, an Ottawa-based provider of intellectual property consulting, patent brokerage, and technical reverse engineering. Oakley said it expects to invest US$49.9 million in the business. The seller is AXIO Group Management Ltd, a portfolio company of Electra Private Equity, a U.K. private equity firm. Oakley will partner in the deal with AXIO CEO Henry Elkington, who will become TechInsights’ chairman with the acquisition’s close. Oakley said it will support the growth of TechInsights’ subscription and syndicated data product offering.
PRESS RELEASE
Oakley Capital Investments Limited: Acquisition of TechInsights
15/05/2017
Oakley Capital Investments Limited1 (AIM:OCL, the “Company”) is pleased to announce that Oakley Capital Private Equity III2 (“Fund III”) has reached an agreement to acquire a majority stake in TechInsights. Fund III is expected to invest US$49.9 million in the business and will invest alongside Henry Elkington, the CEO of the current parent company (AXIO), who brings extensive experience in the industry and will become Chairman of TechInsights at completion. The Company’s indirect contribution through its interest in Fund III is expected to be approximately £18.2 million (GBP/USD = 1.29). 





TechInsights is a global leader in the intellectual property and technology services market. The company has unparalleled capabilities in semiconductor reverse engineering, which is used to prove patent infringement and understand the technology behind everyday consumer electronics. Its customers, including the top ten semiconductor companies globally, rely on TechInsights’ highly skilled engineers and technical abilities, as well as its proprietary database of technical intelligence. TechInsights’ specialised workforce, proprietary equipment and extensive technical library create significant barriers to entry and reinforce its position as the specialist of choice to provide evidence of intellectual property use and competitive technical intelligence.
The investment thesis includes leveraging TechInsights’ extensive, proprietary technology database to accelerate growth in its subscription business, whilst maintaining its market leading position in project-based patent licensing work. TechInsights will be supported in further developing its subscription and syndicated data products by leveraging Oakley Capital’s experience in helping businesses develop their recurring revenue streams.
Following the merger with its main competitor (ChipWorks) in June 2016 TechInsights generated revenues of c. US$45 million and EBITDA of US$12.6 million in 2016, on a pro-forma basis.
Peter Dubens, Director of OCL, commented:
“We are delighted to have reached agreement for an investment in a business of TechInsights’ quality and global reputation. We look forward to supporting Henry Elkington and the experienced management team in developing the business further, particularly by leveraging TechInsights unmatched know-how to grow the subscription and syndicated data product offering.”
