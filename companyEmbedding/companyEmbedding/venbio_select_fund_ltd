About Us – Venture Capital
 Home About Us – Venture Capital 




Our Firm – Venture Capital







  
  
  






We take a unique approach to investments, and it has to do with the people in, behind, and associated with our firm. We make all investments as a team; every member of our firm is involved in every investment that we make. We seek the advice of a wide range of expert advisors. Our Limited Partners include both strategic partners (several large biotech and pharma companies) and qualified financial investors. We listen to our LPs and include their expertise in our diligence. We believe we make better decisions this way.







Additional Information



 
Our Philosophy – Venture Capital
 


venBio invests in promising companies at various stages: from early to late stage, and from academic startups to spinouts. We tend to lead most of our investments, and we enjoy building syndicates and teams.
We are mindful of potential acquisition partners from the outset, and we ensure that our companies are best positioned to meet their requirements. This includes IP, CMC, and the details of clinical trials, including indication, trial design, endpoints, powering, and regulatory considerations. Our team’s expertise and involvement helps companies make a bigger impact, and this leads to impactful and lasting relationships with the leaders that we work with.





 
Our Venture Funds
 


Founded in 2011, venBio’s venture funds comprise approximately $520M of committed capital. We are currently investing out of our second fund of $340M committed capital. Our team combines scientific, clinical and operating experience in our investment decisions. Paul Brooke, a former Managing Partner, retired in 2016.






Our Mission

  We seek out teams who are developing treatments that will have a meaningful impact on patient care. Our mission is to put our companies in the best possible position to succeed, by helping teams think through the best development plan to bring these therapies to patients.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Feb. 18, 2014 /CNW/ - On February 14, 2014, venBio
 Select Fund, L.P. ("venBio") acquired 5,457,522 common shares (the "Shares") of Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the "Company") representing approximately 17.44% of the issued and outstanding
 Shares on a non-diluted basis. The common shares were purchased
 pursuant to a private placement of units (the "Units"), which were issued on February 14, 2014 at a price of US$2.7485 per
 Unit. Each Unit consists of one common share and one-quarter (0.25) of
 a common share purchase warrant (a "Warrant"), exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance.
 Each Warrant entitles venBio to purchase one additional common share of
 the Company at a price of US$3.2204 per share.


In addition, in the event that the Company does not reduce the size of
 its board of directors to seven directors within 90 days following
 closing, an additional 0.1 Warrant will be issued for each Unit
 purchased by venBio for every additional 90 day period delay, up to a
 maximum of 0.35 Warrant per Unit. If the Company does not obtain
 approval to list its common shares on NASDAQ within 12 months following
 the closing, the Company has agreed to issue an additional 0.1 Warrant
 for each Unit purchased by venBio for every 90 day period delay, up to
 a maximum of 0.35 Warrant per Unit. All securities issued in connection
 with the Offering will be subject to a four month hold period from the
 date of issuance in accordance with applicable securities law, which
 expires on June 15, 2014 for the securities issued at closing.


venBio acquired the Units for investment purposes and may, depending on
 the evolution of the Company's business, financial condition, the
 market for the Company's securities, general economic conditions and
 other factors, increase or decrease its beneficial ownership control or
 direction over the Shares of the Company.


The Shares and the Warrants were issued to venBio in reliance on the
 prospectus exemption set out in section 2.10 of National Instrument
 45-106 - Prospectus and Registration Exemptions.
