Young & Rubicam Brands, Inc.


                  We believe the most powerful way to do that is to find the balance between our left- and right-brain thinking. We set that tone of duality and fusion at the top, with David Sable as CEO and Tony Granger as Global Chief Creative Officer.
People have always talked about how smart Y&R is. We earned that rep by building the world’s largest (and most envied) brand database and management tool, BrandAsset® Valuator, with some of the brightest and brainiest people interpreting that data.
Today, with Tony Granger as our global creative leader, people are talking about our creative work just as much. We’ve infused the network with new talent. Integrated digital fully. Found the right way to have the left- and right- brains work together and inspire each other.
