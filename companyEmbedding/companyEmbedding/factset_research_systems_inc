Corporate History
FactSet was founded in 1978 and has been publicly held since 1996. The Company is dual listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “FDS.” Fiscal 2016 marked the Company’s 38th year of operation, its 36th consecutive year of revenue growth and its 20th consecutive year of earnings growth as a public company.
As of August 31, 2016, FactSet has a market capitalization of $7.12 billion, which is up 9.5% over last year. The Company currently has 46 office locations in 21 countries employing more than 8,500 individuals. In March 2016, FactSet was ranked #89 on Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For”, marking the Company’s eighth appearance on the list in the last nine years. FactSet was also recognized as one of the UK’s “Best Workplaces” by the Great Place to Work® Institute UK for the eighth consecutive year, and included in the “2016 Best Places to Work in France” list for the fifth consecutive year. In addition, the Company was awarded the Best Research and Analytics tool at the 2016 Systems in the City Awards, and the Best Overall Provider, Best Research Provider, and Best Analytics Provider at the 2016 Inside Market Data Awards.
Since becoming a public company in 1996, FactSet has evolved from a US-centric software firm into a global company generating approximately a third of its revenues from clients outside the US. Through technological proficiency, a dedicated workforce, and an unwavering commitment to client service, the Company has driven revenue and earnings per share to new heights, as well as increased its international presence, and ultimately, its competitive edge.
2016 Financial Highlights
Fiscal 2016 was another successful year for FactSet as it attained record levels of revenues, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share.
ASV was $1.15 billion at August 31, 2016, up 8.8% organically from the prior year.
Revenue reached $1.13 billion, an increase of 9.9% over the prior year.
As of August 31, 2016, the Company has 3,092 clients and 65,655 users.
Diluted EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of the Market Metrics business, rose to $6.18.
Free cash flow totaled $283.4 million, up $2.6 million from last year.
FactSet returned $431.0 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33.5% over the prior year.
The Company completed the strategic acquisition of Portware in October 2015.
FactSet sold its Market Metrics business in July 2016 and recognized an after-tax gain of $81.7 million.
2016 Product and Content Innovation
Our robust analytics solutions have been the cornerstone of our growth in the middle office. Over the last year we have expanded our offering of analytics, models, stress testing, and client reporting.
Our commitment to technology, high-quality fixed income, and risk analytics presents a compelling solution to clients, providing continuity and unique features in the market. In addition, we continue to diversify and innovate with more enterprise analytical solutions across our clients’ workflows.
The acquisition of Portware was a critical component of our strategy to better serve traders and the front office by more fully supporting the buy-side workflow.
With the onset of more complex regulations globally, clients are looking for help. FactSet is prepared with a thoughtful, comprehensive regulatory-compliant solution for their research needs thanks to our investment in expanding our Research Management Solutions with the acquisition of Code Red in fiscal 2015 and the fruition of our integration.
We completed the integration of the ETF.com asset purchase, which provides our clients with a rich database of US ETF fund flows, reference data, and analytics. There are now 29 ETFs in the marketplace based upon FactSet content; over 40 benchmarks and the first FactSet-branded ETF, the SPDR FactSet Innovative Technology ETF, launched in January.

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform.[7]
In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online.[8]
In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database.[9]
In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products.[10]
Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January,[11] the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April,[12] and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.[13]
In June 2012, FactSet acquired StreetAccount, which provides real-time company updates, portfolio and sector filtering, email alerts, and market summaries for investment professionals.[14]
In 2013, FactSet acquired Revere Data, a provider of a line-of-business industry taxonomy, now branded FactSet Revere.[15]
On February 9th 2015, FactSet acquired Code Red Inc, a leading provider of Research Management technology to the financial community. [16]
On October 16th 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC, a leading multi-asset execution management system (EMS) provider. According to FactSet press releases, the $265 million acquisition--FactSet's largest to date--aims to "provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader." [17] [18]

Financial data[edit]
In 2003, FactSet Research Systems Inc. changed the presentation of its revenues in order to report on a net rather than gross basis. As a result, all financial information for periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were restated.[23]
For 2014, FactSet's 36th year of operation, the company recorded its 34th consecutive year of revenue growth.[24]
For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, FactSet revenues increased to $920 million, growing 7% year on year. Operating income rose 12% to $302 million. Net income advanced to $212 million as compared to $199 million in 2013, a 6% increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 11% to $4.92.[24]

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform.[7]
In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online.[8]
In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database.[9]
In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products.[10]
Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January,[11] the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April,[12] and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.[13]
In June 2012, FactSet acquired StreetAccount, which provides real-time company updates, portfolio and sector filtering, email alerts, and market summaries for investment professionals.[14]
In 2013, FactSet acquired Revere Data, a provider of a line-of-business industry taxonomy, now branded FactSet Revere.[15]
On February 9th 2015, FactSet acquired Code Red Inc, a leading provider of Research Management technology to the financial community. [16]
On October 16th 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC, a leading multi-asset execution management system (EMS) provider. According to FactSet press releases, the $265 million acquisition--FactSet's largest to date--aims to "provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader." [17] [18]

Financial data[edit]

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly.

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform.[7]
In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online.[8]
In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database.[9]
In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products.[10]
Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January,[11] the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April,[12] and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.[13]
In June 2012, FactSet acquired StreetAccount, which provides real-time company updates, portfolio and sector filtering, email alerts, and market summaries for investment professionals.[14]
In 2013, FactSet acquired Revere Data, a provider of a line-of-business industry taxonomy, now branded FactSet Revere.[15]
On February 9th 2015, FactSet acquired Code Red Inc, a leading provider of Research Management technology to the financial community. [16]
On October 16th 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC, a leading multi-asset execution management system (EMS) provider. According to FactSet press releases, the $265 million acquisition--FactSet's largest to date--aims to "provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader." [17] [18]

Financial data[edit]
In 2003, FactSet Research Systems Inc. changed the presentation of its revenues in order to report on a net rather than gross basis. As a result, all financial information for periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were restated.[23]
For 2014, FactSet's 36th year of operation, the company recorded its 34th consecutive year of revenue growth.[24]
For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, FactSet revenues increased to $920 million, growing 7% year on year. Operating income rose 12% to $302 million. Net income advanced to $212 million as compared to $199 million in 2013, a 6% increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 11% to $4.92.[24]

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics.

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform.[7]
In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online.[8]
In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database.[9]
In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products.[10]
Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January,[11] the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April,[12] and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.[13]
In June 2012, FactSet acquired StreetAccount, which provides real-time company updates, portfolio and sector filtering, email alerts, and market summaries for investment professionals.[14]
In 2013, FactSet acquired Revere Data, a provider of a line-of-business industry taxonomy, now branded FactSet Revere.[15]
On February 9th 2015, FactSet acquired Code Red Inc, a leading provider of Research Management technology to the financial community. [16]
On October 16th 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC, a leading multi-asset execution management system (EMS) provider. According to FactSet press releases, the $265 million acquisition--FactSet's largest to date--aims to "provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader." [17] [18]

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform.[7]
In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online.[8]
In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database.[9]
In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products.[10]
Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January,[11] the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April,[12] and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.[13]
In June 2012, FactSet acquired StreetAccount, which provides real-time company updates, portfolio and sector filtering, email alerts, and market summaries for investment professionals.[14]
In 2013, FactSet acquired Revere Data, a provider of a line-of-business industry taxonomy, now branded FactSet Revere.[15]
On February 9th 2015, FactSet acquired Code Red Inc, a leading provider of Research Management technology to the financial community. [16]
On October 16th 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC, a leading multi-asset execution management system (EMS) provider. According to FactSet press releases, the $265 million acquisition--FactSet's largest to date--aims to "provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader." [17] [18]
Products and services[edit]

FactSet's software platform, also called FactSet, includes real-time news and quotes, company and portfolio analysis, multi-company comparisons, industry analysis, company screening, portfolio optimization and simulation, predictive risk measurements, alphatesting and tools to value and analyze fixed income securities and portfolios.[19]

Financial data[edit]
In 2003, FactSet Research Systems Inc. changed the presentation of its revenues in order to report on a net rather than gross basis. As a result, all financial information for periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were restated.[23]
For 2014, FactSet's 36th year of operation, the company recorded its 34th consecutive year of revenue growth.[24]
For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, FactSet revenues increased to $920 million, growing 7% year on year. Operating income rose 12% to $302 million. Net income advanced to $212 million as compared to $199 million in 2013, a 6% increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 11% to $4.92.[24]
For the quarter ended February 28, 2015 (Second Quarter Of Fiscal 2015), revenues advanced to $247.8 million, up 9.2% over the prior year. Annual Subscription Value ("ASV") was $1.005 billion at February 28, 2015, up 8.5% organically over the prior year.[25]

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform.[7]
In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online.[8]
In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database.[9]
In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products.[10]
Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January,[11] the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April,[12] and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.[13]
In June 2012, FactSet acquired StreetAccount, which provides real-time company updates, portfolio and sector filtering, email alerts, and market summaries for investment professionals.[14]
In 2013, FactSet acquired Revere Data, a provider of a line-of-business industry taxonomy, now branded FactSet Revere.[15]
On February 9th 2015, FactSet acquired Code Red Inc, a leading provider of Research Management technology to the financial community. [16]
On October 16th 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC, a leading multi-asset execution management system (EMS) provider. According to FactSet press releases, the $265 million acquisition--FactSet's largest to date--aims to "provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader." [17] [18]

Financial data[edit]
In 2003, FactSet Research Systems Inc. changed the presentation of its revenues in order to report on a net rather than gross basis. As a result, all financial information for periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were restated.[23]
For 2014, FactSet's 36th year of operation, the company recorded its 34th consecutive year of revenue growth.[24]

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

History[edit]
1977–1980[edit]
FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chunk Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan.[4]
As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client.
Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called "Company FactSet," which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet’s private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices.
1981–1989[edit]
In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker.
In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis.[4]
Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985.
1990–2000[edit]
FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT.
A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995.
By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS.[5]
In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications.
The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999.
Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman.
2000–2009[edit]
New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis.[4] In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released.
Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008.
In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals.
2009–present[edit]
In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet.[6] The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform.[7]
In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online.[8]
In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database.[9]
In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products.[10]
Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January,[11] the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April,[12] and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.[13]
In June 2012, FactSet acquired StreetAccount, which provides real-time company updates, portfolio and sector filtering, email alerts, and market summaries for investment professionals.[14]
In 2013, FactSet acquired Revere Data, a provider of a line-of-business industry taxonomy, now branded FactSet Revere.[15]
On February 9th 2015, FactSet acquired Code Red Inc, a leading provider of Research Management technology to the financial community. [16]
On October 16th 2015, FactSet completed its acquisition of Portware, LLC, a leading multi-asset execution management system (EMS) provider. According to FactSet press releases, the $265 million acquisition--FactSet's largest to date--aims to "provide the investment community with state-of-the-art analytic and execution applications across more of the portfolio lifecycle, from analyst to portfolio manager to trader."

Financial data[edit]
In 2003, FactSet Research Systems Inc. changed the presentation of its revenues in order to report on a net rather than gross basis. As a result, all financial information for periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were restated.[23]
For 2014, FactSet's 36th year of operation, the company recorded its 34th consecutive year of revenue growth.[24]
For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014, FactSet revenues increased to $920 million, growing 7% year on year. Operating income rose 12% to $302 million. Net income advanced to $212 million as compared to $199 million in 2013, a 6% increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 11% to $4.92.[24]
For the quarter ended February 28, 2015 (Second Quarter Of Fiscal 2015), revenues advanced to $247.8 million, up 9.2% over the prior year. Annual Subscription Value ("ASV") was $1.005 billion at February 28, 2015, up 8.5% organically over the prior year.[25]

Investor concerns[edit]
The company receives data from providers such as Barra, Dow Jones, Russell, and Lipper. Since contractual relationships with third-party vendors can be terminated with one year’s notice, the company tries to maintain relationships with at least two vendors for each type of data. [26] Recently the company has attempted to maintain or increase its available content by building its own databases or by acquiring content providers. Since 2000, FactSet has made 10 acquisitions, seven of which have been content providers.[27] In 2008, FactSet bought a copy of Thomson's fundamentals database,[28] securing permanent access to global financial data going back to 1980.[29]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
