Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Wyoming:













Does Shaver, Charles W carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Wyoming are registered at the city and county level. The state does not register contractors in Wyoming











How important is contractor licensing in Wyoming?



Contractors may be required to take the International Code Council National Exam before registering at the local level. The state does not require an exam to become a contractor.











Your liability risk when hiring Shaver, Charles W



Contractors in Wyoming are not required by the state to carry general liability or workers compensation insurance.Local regulation may differ, it is always a good idea to only hire contractors with proof of active insurance.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Wyoming, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.

Bennett (Chuck), chairman of Randolph Products, Inc. and vice chairman of Dixie Chemical Company, will serve as ACA vice chairman and treasurer.
 
Shaver has spent more than 35 years in the global petrochemical, oil, and gas industry. From 2004 to 2011, prior to leading Axalta, he was CEO and president of the TPC Group. Shaver also served as VP and GM for General Chemical, from 2001 through 2004 and as a VP and GM for Arch Chemicals from 1999 through 2001. He began his career with the Dow Chemical Company serving in a series of operational, engineering and business positions from 1980 through 1996.
 
Similarly, Bennett has had a career devoted to the industry, beginning in 1979 with a position at Guardsman Products. He held various positions at Guardsman, and was CEO and president upon his departure in 1996, when the company was sold to Lily Industries. At that time, he founded Polymer Products, Inc., a company that manufactured coatings resins. Two years later, he sold the company and served as Cook Composites and Polymers’ CEO until 2008. He was Dixie Chemicals’ CEO from 2009 to 2015. He has been an equity partner involved in various management roles at Randolph Products since 2001.
 
“We’re delighted to have Charlie and Chuck as our new officers,” said ACA president Andy Doyle. “Both gentlemen are extraordinary and experienced leaders committed to the growth and well-being of the paint and coatings industry.”
 
Both Shaver and Bennett will serve two-year terms on ACA’s Board, ending in April 2018.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
