Bhote Product excellence is no longer enough to sustain market dominance. Manufacturers in every industry have long known that there is simply no competitive advantage in mediocre offerings, so these days every assembly line is a model of consistency and a guarantor of well crafted products. But what happens after your product goes out the door? Does its quality last? Is reliability built in, and can the product withstand years of use, misuse, abuse, and torturous conditions? World Class Reliability gives you a proven methodology for replicating a lifetime of wear and tear in a tiny fraction of the time, under completely controlled conditions. This authoritative guide to best reliability practices shows you how to upgrade or replace your current reliability program with a comprehensive testing program known as Multiple Environment Overstress Testing, or MEOST. Link to Purchase:http://equipment-reliability.comRandom Vibration & Shock TestingWayne Tustin This minimal-mathematics minimal-theory text emphasizes test and measurement hardware and practice. Based in part upon Tustin’s lecture notes, it includes new material on digital techniques for spectrum analysis and for digital control of shakers for random, sine and shock testing. The principle focus is on random vibration and MIL-STD-810F. The author shows the need for measurements and describes the most-used instruments for quantizing displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. He discusses instrument selection, usage and calibration. Most effective readouts, including spectrum analysis, are considered. He clarifies such electronic terminology as decibels and spectral density. To provide perspective, he briefly discusses relatively obsolete sinusoidal measurements and testing, also such peripheral subjects as torsional vibration, seismic simulation, acoustic (intense noise) as well as shock measurement and testing.Partners We have strategic partners all around the world.Westpak, Inc.http://www.westpak.comQualmarkhttp://www.qualmark.comHALT & HASS Consultinghttp://www.halthass.co.nzContact Us Thank you for visiting our website.

As much as 50% of reliability testing is elective – companies new to HALT and HASS must be assured of results to justify making the investment in reliability assessment. Reliant Labs is dedicated to quickly and effectively determining your products’ operating margins and to develop and implement solutions that provide measurable results.We give you what you need, and only what you need: Reliant Labs engineers will visit your facility and review your products and manufacturing processes during the design phase in order to devise test parameters. We perform only tests that are necessary and can often narrow down the tests required – keeping costs in check – based on our extensive database of test results and analyses. We will never recommend or over sell you tests you don’t need. Our testing methods quickly expose latent defects during both the design and manufacturing processes. What Makes Us Stand Out?Reliant Labs is the biggest HALT lab in the world.Superior technical skills and guidance. Our customers are secure in the knowledge that tests are set up and executed properly whether attended or run independently.Unmatched flexibility. We can start and move quickly at your schedule.Contacts and resources available – power supply consultant and mechanical engineers for product fixturing on site with fast turnaround time.Timeliness. Quotes are returned in 36 hours or less; tests scheduled within a week and test results typically delivered in 3 days.Reliant Labs will conduct a thorough test and will not take shortcuts or cut corners.Responsiveness. Last minute requests, nights and weekends are taken in stride.Preparation. In addition to extensive laboratory testing equipment, Reliant Labs has also made significant investment in peripheral equipment. We make every attempt to prevent test delays because of a missing connector, cable or screw. Our ValuesKnowledge, experience, commitment and trust – reflect the energy, integrity, personal work ethic and dedication to excellence and advancement of knowledge in our field that ultimately provides the foundation for guaranteeing the service our customers require and deserve.Reliant Labs’ Commitment to You Customer service is the key to success – yours and ours. Reliant Labs is owner operated which allows us to commit an unmatched level of responsiveness, flexibility and added value to every test we perform. Operating among larger more diversified competitors, Reliant Labs’ niche is to leverage our investment in technology and reliability expertise with the attention to detail and customer support that a smaller, nimbler company can deliver. World Class Test ReportsReliant Labs’ reputation for accuracy, integrity and thoroughness in executing and delivering test results is unparalleled. Reliant Labs’ well organized and comprehensive test reports, often running to 30 pages, have set the standard in the industry.  We are committed to intellectual and scientific integrity…test results are repeatable.Most Comprehensive Test Reports Reliant Labs provides high quality environmental testing and reliability services; a true alternative to traditional design qualification.

Bhote Product excellence is no longer enough to sustain market dominance. Manufacturers in every industry have long known that there is simply no competitive advantage in mediocre offerings, so these days every assembly line is a model of consistency and a guarantor of well crafted products. But what happens after your product goes out the door? Does its quality last? Is reliability built in, and can the product withstand years of use, misuse, abuse, and torturous conditions? World Class Reliability gives you a proven methodology for replicating a lifetime of wear and tear in a tiny fraction of the time, under completely controlled conditions. This authoritative guide to best reliability practices shows you how to upgrade or replace your current reliability program with a comprehensive testing program known as Multiple Environment Overstress Testing, or MEOST.

Based in part upon Tustin’s lecture notes, it includes new material on digital techniques for spectrum analysis and for digital control of shakers for random, sine and shock testing. The principle focus is on random vibration and MIL-STD-810F. The author shows the need for measurements and describes the most-used instruments for quantizing displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. He discusses instrument selection, usage and calibration. Most effective readouts, including spectrum analysis, are considered. He clarifies such electronic terminology as decibels and spectral density. To provide perspective, he briefly discusses relatively obsolete sinusoidal measurements and testing, also such peripheral subjects as torsional vibration, seismic simulation, acoustic (intense noise) as well as shock measurement and testing.Partners We have strategic partners all around the world.Westpak, Inc.http://www.westpak.comQualmarkhttp://www.qualmark.comHALT & HASS Consultinghttp://www.halthass.co.nzContact Us Thank you for visiting our website.

Product Services 


Today’s economic environment has many companies reevaluating their value chains (or more accurately value grids) as they shift from linear to three dimensional thinking around business cross linkages and relationships.  While some manufacturers seem resigned to just push for price concessions from suppliers and perhaps ignore the true landed cost of goods, market leaders are forming stronger, broader relationships with key suppliers with aligned values and capabilities. 

	The industry's leading supply chains have evolved from a linear, potentially adversarial procurement model and created avenues to create long-term sustainable value.  These businesses work with their strategic suppliers to refine their relationships and implement business sustainability concepts into every transaction.  Creating a healthy supplier base by assisting each other to drive costs out of the supply chain creates truly sustainable partnerships.

Leading companies emphasizing business sustainability are implementing:


		Supply alliances: shifting to longer-term relationships with sustainable business partners

		 Integrated supply: a sustainable integrated flow and view of materials

		Sustainable product quality standards: business sustainability standards prevalent in material selection, manufacturing process and product packaging 

		Supplier commitments: suppliers aligned with client business metrics

		Supplier compliance: companies work with business partners to meet specific sustainability targets and thus drive improvements together


	Reliant Worldwide Plastics provides holistic value, actively drives costs out of not just the individual component but the entire supply chain.  Piece price is just one facet of the equation.  A true partner looks at the cost of raw materials, shipping, labor costs, warehousing, inventory costs and order fulfillment and attacks each of these providing real solutions to help a client maintain a competitive edge. 

	Our offerings allow you to reduce inventory and labor costs associated with the handling of component parts and sub assembly manufacturing.  Consolidation of assembly and light manufacturing drives our shipping and handling costs while delivering our products to you just in time.  Combine this with our extensive experience in plastic injection molding as well as low cost of operations and we will drive value not just for today but for the life of your product.

(1) Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering.
    The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity.


We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small
independent companies like our self that may result in price reductions and
decreased demand for our file cabinet distribution services. We will be at a
competitive disadvantage in obtaining the facilities, employees, financing and
other resources required to provide file cabinet distribution services by
prospective customers. Our opportunity to obtain customers may be limited by our
financial resources and other assets. We expect to be less able than our larger
competitors to cope with generally increasing costs and expenses of doing
business.


Company Description
We intend to be in the business of providing file cabinet distribution services.
As with any distribution company, we will have a set rate of charges we will
charge per each sold item and this will all be displayed on our website once it
is developed. We will also offer a webpage for a customer to


 request a quote if
they will not like to do it by phone. As we will be new in the business we will
require full payments from our customers before product delivery. Our potential
customers will have two options to pay: They will have the option to pay online
by credit card when they will be given a quote or by check/money order/bank wire
upon arrival of our invoice and before we deliver product. 

Because we are in our initial stage and our website is not yet functional, Mr.
Augustin, president of the company, found our first client by searching the
internet, called him up, told the client about our company and its products,
offered the client good price on file cabinet sets and the client decided to buy
from our company. The requested merchandise was ordered from one of our
suppliers and delivered the order to the client. Our website needs more money to
be invested in it, as soon as we raise money from our offering or make more
money from sales, we will initiate the steps to activate our website. 

We have signed agreements with multiple suppliers, to make sure we have
consistent sources of our merchandise. All agreements have been filed as
exhibits to this registration statement and the details are set out in each
agreement. There are no additional terms not included in the agreement. 

We will continue to offer our products by calling up our customers and potential
customers, contacting them by email, and in the future, by visiting salesmen at
customers' places of business.When we raise enough money through the offering,
we will develop our website and start optimizing it, so then it will show up
near the top when people search for file cabinet products online. We will also
hire salespeople when our resources permit us to do so. 

We order our file cabinets products from the Chinese manufacturer. The customer
pays for the product and we in turn pay the supplier.The order is picked up from
the supplier's location in the United States and delivered to the client's
office, or is picked up at the supplier by our client.Sometimes we cover the
delivery cost, other times our client covers it. We do not import goods to Czech
Republic yet and we do not believe we will be able to expand operations in the
Czech Republic for 3-5 years.
