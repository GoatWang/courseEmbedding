Ultimus Closes Acquisition of Huntington Bancshares’ Fund Servicing 
      Business




Acquisition Increases Ultimus’ Fund Administration Footprint






January 20, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ultimus 
      Fund Solutions®, LLC (Ultimus®), a leading 
      provider of services to mutual funds and investment advisors, today 
      announced the close of the acquisition of Huntington Asset Services, Inc 
      (HASI) and Unified Financial Securities, Inc. (Unified) from Huntington 
      Bancshares Incorporated, originally announced November 16, 2015. The 
      deal, which strengthens Ultimus’ leadership role in the mutual fund 
      industry, closed on December 31, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the 
      business entity names changed to Ultimus Asset Services, LLC and Unified 
      Financial Securities, LLC, both wholly owned subsidiaries of Ultimus 
      Fund Solutions, LLC.
    

      At the close of the deal, Ultimus grew to 83 mutual fund clients with 
      over 170 funds serviced, more than 140 tenured professionals in three 
      locations, $28 billion in net assets under administration, and more than 
      275,000 shareholder account relationships.
    

      “We are delighted to close this acquisition and look forward to speaking 
      with all the new clients over the coming weeks. We are committed to 
      providing all new and existing clients with the best in class servicing 
      that has been a hallmark of Ultimus since its founding. We also welcome 
      new passionate professionals to our team as we continue to grow and 
      expand our footprint,” commented Bob Dorsey, Co-Founder and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Ultimus.
    

      Ultimus, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, will open and maintain new offices 
      in Columbus, Ohio and Indianapolis, Indiana, where the new entities 
      currently operate.
    

      In addition to the Ultimus Managers Trust™, the acquisition adds 3 more 
      series trusts for which Ultimus provides fund administration. These 
      series trusts offer additional depth and scale in the series trust 
      platform for Ultimus, as more asset managers seek to leverage the 
      efficiencies and operational benefits of this structure when launching 
      new funds.
