                    In June 2003, Truett Craft purchased a 150-acre agricultural tract near the southwest corner of Frankford and 98th Street located in the Lubbock-Cooper Independent School District.  The initial Master Plan called for 470 single-family residences and 88 garden homes.  Truett designed the location for the garden homes in the center of the subdivision with only one entrance.  It was his expectation to have an ideal quiet location with rear entry garages for retirees. 

Truett wanted the subdivision to be complete with an elementary school and a church.  Truett was the son of a Methodist preacher and he donated the southwest corner of 98th and Frankford to St. Luke's Methodist Church.  

Lakewood Estates was built in a series of cul-de-sacs that includes triple cul-de-sacs that give an added measure of security to the addition.
The main builders in the subdivision for single-family homes are: Creative Homes, David Rogers Homes, Gerald Long Builders, Kim Craig Construction, and Art Cuevas.  Garden home builders include: Joanie Coles, Truett Craft, and Art Cuevas
