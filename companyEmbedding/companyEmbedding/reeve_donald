Donald C ReeveHilbert, WI

Donald C. “Don” Reeve, age 77, of Hilbert, died on Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at Atrium Post Acute Care in Chilton. He was born May 15, 1939 in Milwaukee, son of the late Charles G. & Mary (Lawrence) Reeve.Following his graduation from high school, Don enlisted in the United States Army where he served as a medic with the 82nd Airborne Division. Don absolutely loved the time he spent in service to this country and spoke frequently about the memories he had and about his time in Germany.Upon being honorably dischared from the Army, he worked for various companies in the area including American Can, Thiel’s Cheese and delivered for the Schwan’s Food Service before he owned and operated Don’s Bar in Hilbert. It was during this time that he married Susan K. Schaffer on July 29, 1967 at St. Peter Lutheran Church in Hilbert.Don later pursued a new career by using his tremendous passion for antiques. He had, over the course of many years, accumulated a vast knowledge for all things unique and collectible. People from all over the country sought out Don’s expertise in the purchasing and selling of antiques.From little on, Don always cherished his faith and the blessings God provided to him in life, especially the toe tapping beats of Southern Gospel Music.As a big kid at heart, Don looked forward to helping with kids activities in the area. He was especially known for his over 25 years of coaching football and softball in the Hilbert area. With a warm personality, Don made many friends over the course of his life, but his nieces and nephews brought him the most joy. He continually gave of himself to others whether they were family, friends, or complete strangers. Don will be greatly missed by all those who knew him and loved him, especially his close circle of friends who were there with him till the end and who had offered their comfort toward Sue.Survivors include his wife: Sue; his sister: Dorothy Majeska; his sisters-in-law and brother-in-law: Nancy Diermeier, Ted (Linda) Schaffer, Patricia Schaffer; and his Godchild: Kathy Piper. He is further survived by nieces, nephews, other relatives and many friends.Don was preceded in death by his parents; his in-laws: Lorraine & Matt Schaffer; his siblings: Roger (Mary) Reeve, Isabelle (Louis) Denoyer, Margaret (Gil) Lesnik, Ruth (Bob) Kronka; and his brothers-in-law: Jim Majeska, Jim Schaffer, Jerry Diermeier.Funeral service will be at 6:00 pm on Tuesday, December 27, 2016 at Wieting Family Funeral Home (411 W. Main St.) in Chilton with the Rev. Timmothy Heath officiating. Friends may call at the funeral home from 3:00 pm until 5:45 PM on Tuesday, December 27, 2016.Don’s family would like to thank the staff of Atrium Post Acute Care in Chilton, as well as the Affinity Hospice Nurses for all of the loving care that was given to Don and his family. 
Don had a good role model for his coach in Leroy Haberkorn - Waupaca as his football and baseball coach. I think he learned well. Sue you are in my prayers.Ralph Block (Classmate) - Jan. 23, 2017My  Deepest Symphaty  to the Family of Donald.Raymond and Beth Gelling (Family Friend) - Dec. 27, 2016Thanks for the wonderful memories of coffee clutching at Sipple's Drive-In, Don!  Big hugs to you, Sue!Shelly (Weinreis) Johnson - Dec. 17, 2016Sue, my sincerest condolences. HUG.Sara Paguia - Dec. 17, 2016God Bless to the entire family, Don was a great coach and fixture with Hilbert football including the first football state championship in 1989, you will always be remembered Don.Nick Schneider (Football player under Don) - Dec. 16, 2016Remembering him coaching
football on the sidelines,
waiting for someone to get
him a golf cart so he could
move faster. Also. memories
of him selling us beautiful
antique dishes, cups and coffee pot. He was always
willing to 'visit' no matter
how busy he was.
Value our 30+ year friendship very
much....it is difficult to say
'good bye' to such a super 
person.  He will be missed
greatly. Until we meet again,
rest in peace,  my dear friend.Don Waldvoge (Friend) - Dec. 14, 2016

Donald C ReeveHilbert, WI

Donald C. “Don” Reeve, age 77, of Hilbert, died on Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at Atrium Post Acute Care in Chilton. He was born May 15, 1939 in Milwaukee, son of the late Charles G. & Mary (Lawrence) Reeve.Following his graduation from high school, Don enlisted in the United States Army where he served as a medic with the 82nd Airborne Division. Don absolutely loved the time he spent in service to this country and spoke frequently about the memories he had and about his time in Germany.Upon being honorably dischared from the Army, he worked for various companies in the area including American Can, Thiel’s Cheese and delivered for the Schwan’s Food Service before he owned and operated Don’s Bar in Hilbert. It was during this time that he married Susan K. Schaffer on July 29, 1967 at St. Peter Lutheran Church in Hilbert.Don later pursued a new career by using his tremendous passion for antiques. He had, over the course of many years, accumulated a vast knowledge for all things unique and collectible. People from all over the country sought out Don’s expertise in the purchasing and selling of antiques.From little on, Don always cherished his faith and the blessings God provided to him in life, especially the toe tapping beats of Southern Gospel Music.As a big kid at heart, Don looked forward to helping with kids activities in the area. He was especially known for his over 25 years of coaching football and softball in the Hilbert area. With a warm personality, Don made many friends over the course of his life, but his nieces and nephews brought him the most joy. He continually gave of himself to others whether they were family, friends, or complete strangers. Don will be greatly missed by all those who knew him and loved him, especially his close circle of friends who were there with him till the end and who had offered their comfort toward Sue.Survivors include his wife: Sue; his sister: Dorothy Majeska; his sisters-in-law and brother-in-law: Nancy Diermeier, Ted (Linda) Schaffer, Patricia Schaffer; and his Godchild: Kathy Piper. He is further survived by nieces, nephews, other relatives and many friends.Don was preceded in death by his parents; his in-laws: Lorraine & Matt Schaffer; his siblings: Roger (Mary) Reeve, Isabelle (Louis) Denoyer, Margaret (Gil) Lesnik, Ruth (Bob) Kronka; and his brothers-in-law: Jim Majeska, Jim Schaffer, Jerry Diermeier.Funeral service will be at 6:00 pm on Tuesday, December 27, 2016 at Wieting Family Funeral Home (411 W. Main St.) in Chilton with the Rev. Timmothy Heath officiating. Friends may call at the funeral home from 3:00 pm until 5:45 PM on Tuesday, December 27, 2016.Don’s family would like to thank the staff of Atrium Post Acute Care in Chilton, as well as the Affinity Hospice Nurses for all of the loving care that was given to Don and his family. 
Don had a good role model for his coach in Leroy Haberkorn - Waupaca as his football and baseball coach. I think he learned well. Sue you are in my prayers.Ralph Block (Classmate) - Jan. 23, 2017My  Deepest Symphaty  to the Family of Donald.Raymond and Beth Gelling (Family Friend) - Dec. 27, 2016Thanks for the wonderful memories of coffee clutching at Sipple's Drive-In, Don!  Big hugs to you, Sue!Shelly (Weinreis) Johnson - Dec. 17, 2016Sue, my sincerest condolences. HUG.Sara Paguia - Dec. 17, 2016God Bless to the entire family, Don was a great coach and fixture with Hilbert football including the first football state championship in 1989, you will always be remembered Don.Nick Schneider (Football player under Don) - Dec. 16, 2016Remembering him coaching
football on the sidelines,
waiting for someone to get
him a golf cart so he could
move faster. Also. memories
of him selling us beautiful
antique dishes, cups and coffee pot. He was always
willing to 'visit' no matter
how busy he was.
Value our 30+ year friendship very
much....it is difficult to say
'good bye' to such a super 
person.  He will be missed
greatly. Until we meet again,
rest in peace,  my dear friend.Don Waldvoge (Friend) - Dec. 14, 2016

Detailed item info
Let Keanu Reeves take you into the gritty underground world of New York City in 'John Wick' on DVD. The film begins when the titular character is attacked by some young trouble makers. Little do they know that the character is actually an ex-assassin with a history of violence. The story follows John Wick as he leaves retirement behind and hunts down his enemies. It is a thrilling film that rightfully deserves its spot in your film collection. The action will keep you on the edge of your seat while the subtle emotions played on screen will keep you intrigued throughout.Product DetailsNumber of Discs:1Rating:R (MPAA)Film Country:CanadaUPC:031398211037Additional DetailsGenre:Action/AdventureFormat:DVD"Reeves reminds what a compelling action star he can be....A clean, efficient and incredibly assured thriller with serious breakout potential..."Variety - Peter Debruge (10/16/2014)"Confidently directed by veteran stuntman Chad Stahelski, JOHN WICK has a pulsating daredevil energy. And the screenplay by Derek Kolstad is a marvelously rich and stylish feat of pulpy world-building." -- Grade: A-Entertainment Weekly - Chris Nashawaty (10/31/2014)3 stars out of 4 -- "Reeves, always a nimble action presence, delivers the goods and then some."Rolling Stone - Peter Travers (10/24/2014)"The sleek and eccentric revenge tale JOHN WICK jabs far above its weight class thanks to the panther physicality of 50-year-old headliner Keanu Reeves and a tightly pitched mix of humor and expertly choreographed hyper-violence..."Los Angeles Times - Robert Abele (10/23/2014)"A visceral revenge thriller that marks a confident, muscular action debut. After a marked absence from the genre, Reeves resoundingly returns with an effortless, kinetic style that positions the film extremely well for any potential follow-ups."Hollywood Reporter (10/23/2014)"Brilliant in its simplicity, the setup of JOHN WICK, like the rest of the movie, passes swiftly and efficiently....With knock-your-socks-off action sequences..."New York Times - Jeannette Catsoulis (10/23/2014)"Unexpectedly terrific....A lean, spare, stylish and grimly, methodically ultra-violent extravaganza that provides star Keanu Reeves with a much-needed infusion of cool."Chicago Sun-Times - Bruce Ingram (10/23/2014)3 stars out of 4 -- "With some dazzling action choreography, stylish visuals and -- most importantly --a vintage anti-hero performance from Keanu Reeves."RogerEbert.com - Christy Lemire (10/24/2014)4 stars out of 5 -- "A giddy helping of artful violence delivered with a wink and a cheeky grin..."Empire - James Dyer (04/02/2015)

A new classic action adventure film.
Believe the hype.  John Wick is engaging, entertaining, and it hooks you with its world and characters.  Proving that shaky cam and horrible editing and cinematography don't have to dominate the action and adventure genres John Wick is a new classic, perhaps the first of the new century.

Product is bad
I bought this product ready to watch it on my DVD and it would not play. Make a long story short, I had to download and become part of a group so I could watch this DVD which three quarter through the movie decided to stop working. If I buy a disc I expect the movie to be on the disc not to have to download the movie.

John Wick
An excellent, exciting, action packed very dark movie about the other side of normal life as we know it. Keanu Reeves best since The Matrix. Great characters, great acting and the story drags you in. Loved it, can't wait for John Wick 2. enjoy.

Great entertainment and training guide
An action packed epic about the extent someone would go to for the love of their dog. With the death of hope a man is thrown into the depths of despair and emerges with the help of a physical meditation in retribution. Technically accurate in technique it could be seen as a guide for tuning your personal performance criteria in dealing with the troubled world we all live in. It may make you wonder if your physical prowess is up to speed and if you have the stamina to compete when everything is at stake, and offer guidance for improvement.

I highly recommend Reeve's performance as John Wicks, it is his best since his portrayal of Siddhartha in "little Buddha", and John Wicks 2 could be potentially as enlightening.

John Wick rules.
This movie is great. And Keanu Reeves is excellent as John Wick. This is a movie you will want to watch over and over to root for John. John Wick 2 is just as good. Looking forward to getting a copy of that.

Enjoy classic comedies like Monk and The Beverly Hillbillies, dramas like Breaking Bad and Quincy, and even soap operas like Dallas and Dawson’s Creek. You’ll save whether you’re buying an individual season, or the entire series.Load Up Your CollectionYou can become a serious collector of a lifetime’s worth of entertainment with all the movies and TV shows and DVDs available on eBay. You’ll find everything from new releases to musicals to foreign movies to classic war stories and westerns.
