Specialized Laparoscopic Mode

Bovie’s Cut II is tailored specifically for Laparoscopic procedures. The mode offers a precisely managed cutting energy that limits output thereby minimizing the potential risk of capacitive coupling and alternate site burns.

Dual Monopolar Spray Activation

The SurgiCenter|PRO offers simultaneous activation in spray with audible activation tones. The simultaneous delivery produces equal and even power outputs in each accessory, for a safer delivery of dual monopolar energy.

Adjustable Power during Activation

The power can be adjusted up or down in variable steps while performing procedure, to increase procedural efficiency and provide the appropriate amount of power to the surgical site.

Surgical Memory Technology

The SurgiCenter|PRO recalls the last used power and mode. The surgeon  can store 10 user-defined RF presets for easy recall.

Patient Safety Features


This return electrode contact quality monitoring system is designed to minimize the risk of patient burns at the return electrode site. This feature works in conjunction with disposable split return electrodes.


Bovie FDFS™ - The tissue sensing technology measure tissue 5 million times a second and adjusts to varying impedances 5000 times a second for accurate energy delivery.

 Automatic system self-checks upon powering up the unit.



   
CUT

Cut I – A general cutting with a standard RF waveform used in open and endoscopic surgical procedure, Cut I is for use in a wide range of tissue with minimal hemostasis.  

Cut II – Tailored specifically for Laparoscopic procedures, Cut II offers a precisely managed cutting energy that limits output for the minimizing of the potential risk of capacitive coupling and alternate site burns due to weakened insulation.

Blend (Level 1, 2, 3 & 4) – Blended cutting offers varying levels of hemostasis during a cut procedure providing increased control of bleeding at the surgical application site.

COAGULATION

Pinpoint – A general coagulation mode delivering rapid desiccation effects with minimal tissue damage.

Spray – Recommended for hemostasis in highly vascular or large surface areas and for non-contact tissue coagulation to control superficial bleeding. Spray mode permits dual, simultaneous activation of two monopolar accessories with audible dual activation tone alert.

Gentle – Gentle mode offers more concentrated coagulation than in other modes. For instance, when coagulation is necessary in short amounts of time, reduced electrode carbonization is provided.
                 
BIPOLAR

Macro – Intense bipolar output allowing for aggressive coagulation, with cut-like effects over a wide range of tissue.

Micro – Fine bipolar coagulation for use in extremely gentle and precise surgical applications.

Standard – Bipolar coagulation which gently coagulates tissue for minimal tissue damage reducing carbonization and sticking.

Bio: My passion is to ensure that my clients avoid financial failure and facilitate living their vision of the good life. I’ve seen first-hand the impact of poor financial decision making as well as the adverse implications of conventional advice. I view myself as a protector. I’m on a mission to defend against the shortfalls of common planning, inadequate products, advisors who promote risky strategies and the impact of plans that don’t take into account the unpredictability of real life. I accomplish this by viewing your finances through a wide angle lens and using a comprehensive planning approach. 
I collaborate with families, professionals and owners of closely held companies.
Born and raised in Kansas, Aaron set down roots in San Diego after a decade of service as an officer in the Marine Corps. He and his wife, Kathryn, have two children and are active members of the San Diego community. 
Aside from Aaron’s professional life, he enjoys adventures, reading, outdoor sports and being engaged in his children’s education and activities.
Living Legacy is part of the Westpac Wealth Partners Family.
