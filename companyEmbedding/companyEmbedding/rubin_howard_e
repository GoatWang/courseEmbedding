jed.rubin@rubinworldwide.com


            Mr. Jed Rubin has worked in the field of technology economics for more than 10 years.
            In addition to providing support to hundreds of global 2000 clients, Mr. Rubin has also
            been involved in academic research, product development, publications, and speaking
            engagements in North America and across Europe.
            

            Prior to forming Rubin Worldwide with Dr. Howard Rubin, Mr. Jed Rubin worked at Gartner,
            where he served as Director of the Worldwide IT Benchmark Service, a service he led since
            its inception at META Group in 2002. (META Group was acquired by Gartner in 2005.) During
            this time, Mr. Rubin was responsible for the annual publication of the Worldwide IT
            Benchmark Report and META Group's IT Measurement Desk Reference, as well as other product
            development initiatives.
            

            In addition, Mr. Rubin worked for Rubin Systems where he assisted in developing the
            Worldwide IT Benchmark Report and an IT Benchmarking Website, metricnet.com, which
            was acquired by META Group in 2000. Mr. Rubin also assisted in the writing of the
            Global New-Economy Index and the States Technology Index, both of which analyzed
            the technological competitiveness of several geographies. Research collaboration
            includes activity with MIT Sloan, INSEAD, the State of Ohio, the University of
            Texas, and The Property & Casualty Association of America.
            

            Mr. Rubin holds a double bachelor's degree in psychology and Spanish from Oberlin
            College in Ohio. He earned an MBA from the Instituto de Empresa in Madrid, Spain,
            where he is currently an associate professor. Mr. Rubin lives in Madrid and is
            fluent in Spanish.

                  Dr. Rubin is one of the best professors I've had at MDCC Kendall, very knowledgeable,  he goes strictly by the syllabus, very straight forward no hidden surprises.  I enjoyed his lectures, he will make you work for the grade but if you study and do the extra credit assignments you will do well.

TOUGH GRADER


                  He doesn't take his lectures seriously. Bad teacher. I even spoke with the head of the Biology Department about how terrible a teacher he was and she replied with "you have no idea." I am not one of those lazy kids that don't go to class. He isnt used to online but has his exams online, he makes up the questions so they are difficult to understand.

                  Test are extremely difficult. He pulls the test questions from a test bank but they are incredibly precise and detailed. His grading on the papers is fairly easy. If you do a good job you're guaranteed a 100% which can help pull up your grade. His slides are more like overviews and will not help with the test. You must read the book to do well!

                  HORRIBLE ! He took over for my Professor due to personal problems and he screwed over the class. Took him a month to upload assignments t. Doesn't clarify anything, test and quizzes arent able to be studied from because he blocks them off, and you know how some teachers open assignments at the end of the semester for resubmitt? yea he doesn't

                  This is the worst teacher I've had so far. Do not take this guy I repeat "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AS HIM FOR A TEACHER". Yes biology can be quit difficult sometimes but what the hell this guy makes it like academic suicide. He tells to read the book to get a good grade on the tests yet many of the questions are difficult to understand.

                  Hands down the worst teacher in miami dade. Very rude, does not answer any questions, instructions for the discussion board are unclear. I think almost everyone in the class failed. He is that bad. How has no one reported him to the dean yet?

                  Worst online professor I have ever taken a class with. Unclear with assignment directions and topics covered on midterm and final exam. Asked for help on discussion board, as did many students, and never received a response.... Rude!

                  This is not the professor I signed up for. Worst teacher ever! Clueless, doesn't care about the students progress, and his instructions are very unclear and his quizzes are full of errors. I'll probably still get a decent grade but I wont be getting an A which will ruin my current 4.0 GPA. I don't understand how he has a job, he's that bad.

                  Wow! I am stunned. I've never had such a horrible experience before. I thought I did, but Prof. Rubin brings "bad" to a whole new level. Main problem: his directions don't match his expectations and his study guides have nothing to do with the quizzes. I only got an A because I memorized the text book!! Good Luck if you take him!

                  yes. This professor is very though.I took this class online. If you submitted the discussion late , he deducts your points everyday. So be very careful,better you prepare the posts already and submit on the day he assigns. His questions are so vague..and it is very hard to find in book. Anyway I got an'A' but it was a hard work. I donot recommend

                  He clearly reviewed test questions the class before the test. He even gave extra points on every test and gave extensions on almost every test/assignment. Wants you to succeed and tries to help.

                  Dr. Rubin said his class is hard, and it was.  He covered all test questions in the lectures.  He gave clear written instructions, explained them and took questions on written assignments. He reviewed test material 1week before each test. He made himself available after class, by e-mail, or appointment.  He was normally kind, interesting and funny.

                  He sets a due date and requests the work to be turn in prior. If not, he deducts points!! Students had to appeal their grades as he refuses to give anyone an A. Horrible teacher! Very harsh on all the post and even the comments to the students. Doesn't explain a damn thing. I got a B when I know I was suppose to get an A.

                  This guy is the worst!! Please students, do yourselves a favor and avoid taking his class. For his online classes, he gives so many D's and F's for writing assignments and forums (the bulk of the class). Even people who write well barely have a chance. He doesn't explain anything to you and his questions are vague. Don't bother. Worst teacher ever!

Several large, established automotive firms, as well as relatively new players, are all busy preparing for the launch of fully autonomous vehicles conforming to the SAE 5 standard, i.e. capable of automated steering, acceleration, deceleration, monitoring the driving environment, and addressing all critical situations without having to rely on human assistance.

London Event Review: 2015 Annual Tech Law Update hosts over 140 tech industry players

                                        Our Tech & Comms group hosted its annual Tech Law update at the British Library in London, welcoming over 140 delegates from the UK Tech sector. Partners from across our international network and guest speakers presented on the most current and pressing issues in Tech Law, providing in-house lawyers working in technology companies and contracting personnel in user organisations an understanding of the important tech legal and contract developments over the last year.  Presentations  Following a welcome from Roger Bickerstaff (London), Andrew White (London) gave an update on contract law. Alexander Duisberg (Munich) then looked at the legal issues involved in Big Data, while Benoit Van Asbroeck (Brussels) presented on Current trends in Cloud Service contracts.  The second part of the day was kicked off with a review of the Internet/eCommerce law year by Graham Smith (London), followed by Roger Bickerstaff, who examined what an EU Digital Single Market means for Businesses. Howard Rubin (London) was then joined by guest speakers Lyndon Coppin (Director, Head of Legal - Barclays Operations, Technology & Commercial Legal, UK & EME) and Clive Taylor (Programme Director - Post Office digital transformation project) to talk about Digital Transformation in Practice in Criminal Justice and Financial Services.  Workshops  In the morning the delegates were invited to attend one of two workshops:   Financial Services/Adapting to Technology Developments: Exploring how traditional banks and FinTech suppliers/start-ups can adapt to the disruptive digital technologies challenge – led by London associates Jonny Emmanuel, Ali Ramadan and Oli Irons. Funding the Internet of Things: Reviewing a range of alternative funding approaches for IoT, particularly looking at parallels from the more innovate energy developments – led by Professor Mischa Dohler, Chair Professor of Wireless Communications, Kings College London and partners Roger Bickerstaff and Isabel Evans. Demo room  In an adjacent demo room, rolling presentations took place throughout the day looking into the latest disruptive technologies from early stage and scale-up companies.  The companies presenting included the 2014 winners of the Bird & Bird Disruptive Technology Challenge 2014 held in Munich, as well as FabLab (one of our UK CSR partners) and Fliplet (the platform many of the Bird & Bird apps have been developed on).  The highly successful day was rounded off by drinks and networking. You can see tweets from the day at @twobirdstech
