Creation[edit]
Main article: History of the petroleum industry in Canada
Canada's population was booming during the 1950s, and energy shortages were becoming problematic.[1] Canadian company TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. was incorporated in 1951 to undertake the construction of a natural gas pipeline across Canada. The financing of the project was split 50-50 between American and Canadian interests.[1]
Two applicants originally expressed interest in moving gas east: Canadian Delhi Oil Company (now called TCPL) proposed moving gas to the major cities of eastern Canada by an all-Canadian route, while Western Pipelines wanted to stop at Winnipeg with a branch line south to sell into the midwestern United States. In 1954 C.D. Howe, a member of the Cabinet of Canada of a Liberal Government, forced the two companies to merge, with the all-Canadian route preferred over its more economical but American-routed competitor. This imposed solution reflected problems encountered with the construction of the Interprovincial oil pipeline. Despite the speed of its construction, the earlier line caused angry debate in Parliament, with the Opposition arguing that Canadian centres deserved consideration before American customers and that "the main pipeline carrying Canadian oil should be laid in Canadian soil". By constructing its natural gas mainline along an entirely Canadian route, TCPL accommodated nationalist sentiments, solving a political problem for the federal government.
The regulatory process for TCPL proved long and arduous. After rejecting proposals twice, Alberta finally granted its permission to export gas from the province in 1953. At first, the province waited for explorers to prove gas reserves sufficient for its thirty-year needs, intending to only allow exports in excess of those needs. After clearing this hurdle, the federal government virtually compelled TCPL into a merger with Western pipelines. When this reorganized TCPL went before the Federal Power Commission for permission to sell gas into the United States, the Americans greeted it coolly. The FPC proved sceptical of the project's financing and unimpressed with Alberta's reserves.
Politics[edit]
Main article: Pipeline Debate
The 1,090-kilometre section crossing the Canadian Shield was the most difficult leg of the pipeline. Believing construction costs could make the line uneconomic, private sector sponsors refused to finance this portion of the line. Since the federal government wanted the line laid for nationalistic reasons, the reigning Liberals put a bill before Parliament to create a crown corporation to build and own the Canadian Shield portion of the line, leasing it back to TCPL.
The Louis St. Laurent government aggressively restricted debate on this bill in order to get construction underway by June 1956, knowing that delays beyond that month would postpone the entire project a year. The use of closure created a Parliamentary scandal. Known as the Great Pipeline Debate, this parliamentary episode contributed to the government's defeat at the polls in 1957, ending many years of Liberal rule, and bringing in a government under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.[2]
The bill was passed and construction of the TransCanada pipeline began.
A stock trading scandal surrounding Northern Ontario Natural Gas, the contractor for the Northern Ontario leg of the pipeline, also implicated Sudbury mayor Leo Landreville and Ontario provincial cabinet ministers Philip Kelly, William Griesinger and Clare Mapledoram between 1955 and 1958.[3]
Construction[edit]
The completion of this project was a spectacular technological achievement. In the first three years of construction (1956–58), workers installed 3,500 kilometres of pipe, stretching from the Alberta-Saskatchewan border to Toronto and Montreal. Gas service to Regina and Winnipeg commenced in 1957 and the line reached the Lakehead before the end of that year.
Building the Canadian Shield leg required continual blasting. For one 320 metres (1,050 ft) stretch, the construction crew drilled 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) holes into the rock, three abreast, at 56-centimetre intervals. Dynamite broke up other stretches, 305 metres (1,001 ft) at a time.
On 10 October 1958, a final weld completed the line and on 27 October, the first Alberta gas entered Toronto. For more than two decades, the Trans-Canada pipeline was the longest in the world.[4] Only in the early 1980s was its length finally exceeded by a Soviet pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe.
Incidents[edit]

In late 1957, during a high pressure line test on the section of the line from Winnipeg to Port Arthur (today called Thunder Bay), about five and a half kilometres of pipeline blew up near Dryden. After quick repairs, the line delivered Alberta gas to Port Arthur before the end of the year, making the entire trip on its own wellhead pressure.
On 30 May 1979 an explosion caused evacuations in Englehart, Ontario, about 200 kilometres north of North Bay, Ontario[5]
On 1 December 2003, a rupture in the pipeline occurred at approximately 53°53′N 117°41′W﻿ / ﻿53.883°N 117.683°W﻿ / 53.883; -117.683 (120 km south of Grande Prairie, Alberta). 14 hours later, another rupture and fire occurred 15 km downstream from the initial incident. According to TransCanada PipeLines, the breaks were immediately isolated, and any already escaped gas was allowed to burn off.
On 20 July 2009, the Peace River Mainline in northern Alberta exploded, sending 50-metre-tall flames into the air and razing a two-hectare wooded area. According to CBC News, reports about the causes and actual extent of the explosion were redacted from a January 2011 government report and were only fully revealed after a media inquiry in 2014.[6]
On 13 September 2009 a similar explosion to that of 1979 occurred, in Englehart, Ontario, leaving a 20-foot (6.1 m) hole at the explosion site.[7][8]
On 19 February 2011, a pipeline explosion occurred just outside Beardmore, Ontario, 190 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. [9]
On 7 May 2011, a failure on TransCanada' Keystone Pipeline occurred in North Dakota, spilling about 400 barrels of crude oil. This pipeline was built in 2008 to 2009.[10]
A rupture of TransCanada's Bison pipeline on 20 July 2011, sent a massive cloud of dust into the air in northeast Wyoming. The explosion happened just six months after the pipeline went into service. The explosion blew out a 12-metre section of pipeline and shook buildings more than a kilometer away, but caused no injuries or death. There was no fire in this incident.[11][12]
On 25 January 2014, a fire broke out around 1:15 a.m. local time on the Canadian Mainline natural gas pipeline system near the community about 25 kilometres south of Winnipeg near St. Pierre-Jolys, Manitoba. Five homes were evacuated as a precaution after a natural gas pipeline explosion.[13][14]
On 16 September 2014, more than 500 residents of Benton Harbor, Michigan, were forced to leave their homes for 10 to 12 hours, after authorities discovered a leak on a 22-inch TransCanada gas transmission pipeline.[15][16]

Trans-Quebec and Maritimes Pipeline (572 km)
Tuscarora Gas Pipeline (491 km)

Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[7]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[8] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[9]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[10]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[11] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[12]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[13][14]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[14] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[15][16][17][18]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[13] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[19]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[13][15]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[20]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[4]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[21] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[22]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[21]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[21]

The route of the TransCanada pipeline


The TransCanada pipeline is a system of natural gas pipelines, up to 121.92 centimetres (48 Inches) in diameter, that carries gas through Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. It is maintained by TransCanada PipeLines, LP. It is the longest pipeline in Canada.

Creation[edit]
Main article: History of the petroleum industry in Canada
Canada's population was booming during the 1950s, and energy shortages were becoming problematic.[1] Canadian company TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. was incorporated in 1951 to undertake the construction of a natural gas pipeline across Canada. The financing of the project was split 50-50 between American and Canadian interests.[1]
Two applicants originally expressed interest in moving gas east: Canadian Delhi Oil Company (now called TCPL) proposed moving gas to the major cities of eastern Canada by an all-Canadian route, while Western Pipelines wanted to stop at Winnipeg with a branch line south to sell into the midwestern United States. In 1954 C.D. Howe, a member of the Cabinet of Canada of a Liberal Government, forced the two companies to merge, with the all-Canadian route preferred over its more economical but American-routed competitor. This imposed solution reflected problems encountered with the construction of the Interprovincial oil pipeline. Despite the speed of its construction, the earlier line caused angry debate in Parliament, with the Opposition arguing that Canadian centres deserved consideration before American customers and that "the main pipeline carrying Canadian oil should be laid in Canadian soil". By constructing its natural gas mainline along an entirely Canadian route, TCPL accommodated nationalist sentiments, solving a political problem for the federal government.
The regulatory process for TCPL proved long and arduous. After rejecting proposals twice, Alberta finally granted its permission to export gas from the province in 1953. At first, the province waited for explorers to prove gas reserves sufficient for its thirty-year needs, intending to only allow exports in excess of those needs. After clearing this hurdle, the federal government virtually compelled TCPL into a merger with Western pipelines. When this reorganized TCPL went before the Federal Power Commission for permission to sell gas into the United States, the Americans greeted it coolly. The FPC proved sceptical of the project's financing and unimpressed with Alberta's reserves.
Politics[edit]
Main article: Pipeline Debate
The 1,090-kilometre section crossing the Canadian Shield was the most difficult leg of the pipeline. Believing construction costs could make the line uneconomic, private sector sponsors refused to finance this portion of the line. Since the federal government wanted the line laid for nationalistic reasons, the reigning Liberals put a bill before Parliament to create a crown corporation to build and own the Canadian Shield portion of the line, leasing it back to TCPL.
The Louis St. Laurent government aggressively restricted debate on this bill in order to get construction underway by June 1956, knowing that delays beyond that month would postpone the entire project a year. The use of closure created a Parliamentary scandal. Known as the Great Pipeline Debate, this parliamentary episode contributed to the government's defeat at the polls in 1957, ending many years of Liberal rule, and bringing in a government under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.[2]
The bill was passed and construction of the TransCanada pipeline began.
A stock trading scandal surrounding Northern Ontario Natural Gas, the contractor for the Northern Ontario leg of the pipeline, also implicated Sudbury mayor Leo Landreville and Ontario provincial cabinet ministers Philip Kelly, William Griesinger and Clare Mapledoram between 1955 and 1958.[3]
Construction[edit]
The completion of this project was a spectacular technological achievement. In the first three years of construction (1956–58), workers installed 3,500 kilometres of pipe, stretching from the Alberta-Saskatchewan border to Toronto and Montreal. Gas service to Regina and Winnipeg commenced in 1957 and the line reached the Lakehead before the end of that year.
Building the Canadian Shield leg required continual blasting. For one 320 metres (1,050 ft) stretch, the construction crew drilled 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) holes into the rock, three abreast, at 56-centimetre intervals. Dynamite broke up other stretches, 305 metres (1,001 ft) at a time.
On 10 October 1958, a final weld completed the line and on 27 October, the first Alberta gas entered Toronto. For more than two decades, the Trans-Canada pipeline was the longest in the world.[4] Only in the early 1980s was its length finally exceeded by a Soviet pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe.
Incidents[edit]

In late 1957, during a high pressure line test on the section of the line from Winnipeg to Port Arthur (today called Thunder Bay), about five and a half kilometres of pipeline blew up near Dryden. After quick repairs, the line delivered Alberta gas to Port Arthur before the end of the year, making the entire trip on its own wellhead pressure.
On 30 May 1979 an explosion caused evacuations in Englehart, Ontario, about 200 kilometres north of North Bay, Ontario[5]
On 1 December 2003, a rupture in the pipeline occurred at approximately 53°53′N 117°41′W﻿ / ﻿53.883°N 117.683°W﻿ / 53.883; -117.683 (120 km south of Grande Prairie, Alberta). 14 hours later, another rupture and fire occurred 15 km downstream from the initial incident. According to TransCanada PipeLines, the breaks were immediately isolated, and any already escaped gas was allowed to burn off.
On 20 July 2009, the Peace River Mainline in northern Alberta exploded, sending 50-metre-tall flames into the air and razing a two-hectare wooded area. According to CBC News, reports about the causes and actual extent of the explosion were redacted from a January 2011 government report and were only fully revealed after a media inquiry in 2014.[6]
On 13 September 2009 a similar explosion to that of 1979 occurred, in Englehart, Ontario, leaving a 20-foot (6.1 m) hole at the explosion site.[7][8]
On 19 February 2011, a pipeline explosion occurred just outside Beardmore, Ontario, 190 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. [9]
On 7 May 2011, a failure on TransCanada' Keystone Pipeline occurred in North Dakota, spilling about 400 barrels of crude oil. This pipeline was built in 2008 to 2009.[10]
A rupture of TransCanada's Bison pipeline on 20 July 2011, sent a massive cloud of dust into the air in northeast Wyoming. The explosion happened just six months after the pipeline went into service. The explosion blew out a 12-metre section of pipeline and shook buildings more than a kilometer away, but caused no injuries or death. There was no fire in this incident.[11][12]
On 25 January 2014, a fire broke out around 1:15 a.m. local time on the Canadian Mainline natural gas pipeline system near the community about 25 kilometres south of Winnipeg near St. Pierre-Jolys, Manitoba. Five homes were evacuated as a precaution after a natural gas pipeline explosion.[13][14]
On 16 September 2014, more than 500 residents of Benton Harbor, Michigan, were forced to leave their homes for 10 to 12 hours, after authorities discovered a leak on a 22-inch TransCanada gas transmission pipeline.[15][16]

Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[7]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[8] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[9]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[10]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[11] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[12]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[13][14]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[14] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[15][16][17][18]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[13] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[19]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[13][15]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[20]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[4]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[21] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[22]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[21]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[21]

The route of the TransCanada pipeline


The TransCanada pipeline is a system of natural gas pipelines, up to 121.92 centimetres (48 Inches) in diameter, that carries gas through Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. It is maintained by TransCanada PipeLines, LP. It is the longest pipeline in Canada.

Creation[edit]
Main article: History of the petroleum industry in Canada
Canada's population was booming during the 1950s, and energy shortages were becoming problematic.[1] Canadian company TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. was incorporated in 1951 to undertake the construction of a natural gas pipeline across Canada. The financing of the project was split 50-50 between American and Canadian interests.[1]
Two applicants originally expressed interest in moving gas east: Canadian Delhi Oil Company (now called TCPL) proposed moving gas to the major cities of eastern Canada by an all-Canadian route, while Western Pipelines wanted to stop at Winnipeg with a branch line south to sell into the midwestern United States. In 1954 C.D. Howe, a member of the Cabinet of Canada of a Liberal Government, forced the two companies to merge, with the all-Canadian route preferred over its more economical but American-routed competitor. This imposed solution reflected problems encountered with the construction of the Interprovincial oil pipeline. Despite the speed of its construction, the earlier line caused angry debate in Parliament, with the Opposition arguing that Canadian centres deserved consideration before American customers and that "the main pipeline carrying Canadian oil should be laid in Canadian soil". By constructing its natural gas mainline along an entirely Canadian route, TCPL accommodated nationalist sentiments, solving a political problem for the federal government.
The regulatory process for TCPL proved long and arduous. After rejecting proposals twice, Alberta finally granted its permission to export gas from the province in 1953. At first, the province waited for explorers to prove gas reserves sufficient for its thirty-year needs, intending to only allow exports in excess of those needs. After clearing this hurdle, the federal government virtually compelled TCPL into a merger with Western pipelines. When this reorganized TCPL went before the Federal Power Commission for permission to sell gas into the United States, the Americans greeted it coolly. The FPC proved sceptical of the project's financing and unimpressed with Alberta's reserves.
Politics[edit]
Main article: Pipeline Debate
The 1,090-kilometre section crossing the Canadian Shield was the most difficult leg of the pipeline. Believing construction costs could make the line uneconomic, private sector sponsors refused to finance this portion of the line. Since the federal government wanted the line laid for nationalistic reasons, the reigning Liberals put a bill before Parliament to create a crown corporation to build and own the Canadian Shield portion of the line, leasing it back to TCPL.
The Louis St. Laurent government aggressively restricted debate on this bill in order to get construction underway by June 1956, knowing that delays beyond that month would postpone the entire project a year. The use of closure created a Parliamentary scandal. Known as the Great Pipeline Debate, this parliamentary episode contributed to the government's defeat at the polls in 1957, ending many years of Liberal rule, and bringing in a government under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.[2]
The bill was passed and construction of the TransCanada pipeline began.
A stock trading scandal surrounding Northern Ontario Natural Gas, the contractor for the Northern Ontario leg of the pipeline, also implicated Sudbury mayor Leo Landreville and Ontario provincial cabinet ministers Philip Kelly, William Griesinger and Clare Mapledoram between 1955 and 1958.[3]
Construction[edit]
The completion of this project was a spectacular technological achievement. In the first three years of construction (1956–58), workers installed 3,500 kilometres of pipe, stretching from the Alberta-Saskatchewan border to Toronto and Montreal. Gas service to Regina and Winnipeg commenced in 1957 and the line reached the Lakehead before the end of that year.
Building the Canadian Shield leg required continual blasting. For one 320 metres (1,050 ft) stretch, the construction crew drilled 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) holes into the rock, three abreast, at 56-centimetre intervals. Dynamite broke up other stretches, 305 metres (1,001 ft) at a time.
On 10 October 1958, a final weld completed the line and on 27 October, the first Alberta gas entered Toronto. For more than two decades, the Trans-Canada pipeline was the longest in the world.[4] Only in the early 1980s was its length finally exceeded by a Soviet pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe.
Incidents[edit]

In late 1957, during a high pressure line test on the section of the line from Winnipeg to Port Arthur (today called Thunder Bay), about five and a half kilometres of pipeline blew up near Dryden. After quick repairs, the line delivered Alberta gas to Port Arthur before the end of the year, making the entire trip on its own wellhead pressure.
On 30 May 1979 an explosion caused evacuations in Englehart, Ontario, about 200 kilometres north of North Bay, Ontario[5]
On 1 December 2003, a rupture in the pipeline occurred at approximately 53°53′N 117°41′W﻿ / ﻿53.883°N 117.683°W﻿ / 53.883; -117.683 (120 km south of Grande Prairie, Alberta). 14 hours later, another rupture and fire occurred 15 km downstream from the initial incident. According to TransCanada PipeLines, the breaks were immediately isolated, and any already escaped gas was allowed to burn off.
On 20 July 2009, the Peace River Mainline in northern Alberta exploded, sending 50-metre-tall flames into the air and razing a two-hectare wooded area. According to CBC News, reports about the causes and actual extent of the explosion were redacted from a January 2011 government report and were only fully revealed after a media inquiry in 2014.[6]
On 13 September 2009 a similar explosion to that of 1979 occurred, in Englehart, Ontario, leaving a 20-foot (6.1 m) hole at the explosion site.[7][8]
On 19 February 2011, a pipeline explosion occurred just outside Beardmore, Ontario, 190 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. [9]
On 7 May 2011, a failure on TransCanada' Keystone Pipeline occurred in North Dakota, spilling about 400 barrels of crude oil. This pipeline was built in 2008 to 2009.[10]
A rupture of TransCanada's Bison pipeline on 20 July 2011, sent a massive cloud of dust into the air in northeast Wyoming. The explosion happened just six months after the pipeline went into service. The explosion blew out a 12-metre section of pipeline and shook buildings more than a kilometer away, but caused no injuries or death. There was no fire in this incident.[11][12]
On 25 January 2014, a fire broke out around 1:15 a.m. local time on the Canadian Mainline natural gas pipeline system near the community about 25 kilometres south of Winnipeg near St. Pierre-Jolys, Manitoba. Five homes were evacuated as a precaution after a natural gas pipeline explosion.[13][14]
On 16 September 2014, more than 500 residents of Benton Harbor, Michigan, were forced to leave their homes for 10 to 12 hours, after authorities discovered a leak on a 22-inch TransCanada gas transmission pipeline.[15][16]

Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[7]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[8] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[9]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[10]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[11] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[12]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[13][14]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[14] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[15][16][17][18]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[13] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[19]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[13][15]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[20]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[4]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[21] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[22]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[21]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[21]

Sponsorships[edit]
In 2014, Transcanada sponsored the Grand Final event held in Edmonton, Canada for the 2014 ITU World Triathlon Series.[25] In 2015 the company was a major sponsor for the 2015 World U-17 Hockey Challenge held in Dawson Creek and Fort St. John, British Columbia.[26] Transcanada committed $25,000 in sponsorship funding to assist the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the maintenance of the Iron Belle Trail. The company adopted a 2 kilometres (1 mile) long stretch of the trail in Kalkaska County, Michigan near an ANR Pipeline facility.[27]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[13][14]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[14] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[15][16][17][18]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[13] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[19]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[13][15]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[20]

Keystone Pipeline
Trans-Quebec and Maritimes Pipeline (572 km)
Tuscarora Gas Pipeline (491 km)

Keystone Pipeline[edit]
TransCanada maintains that people have public access to the pipeline, thus supporting criteria for eminent domain. "It's open for anyone to do business on our pipeline, we welcome business to our pipe." said TransCanada Media Relations Michael Barnes.[7]
At one point in October 2011, TransCanada was involved in up to 56 separate eminent domain actions against landowners in Texas and South Dakota who have refused to give permission to the company to build the Keystone Pipeline on their land.[8] However, on August 23, 2012, Texas Judge Bill Harris ruled that TransCanada has the legal right of eminent domain and may lease or purchase land from owners who refused to sign an agreement with the company for the public right-of-way of a pipeline. The landowners had claimed that because the pipeline was not open to other companies, it did not meet the criteria for eminent domain.[9]
On September 27, 2012, protesters began tree sitting in the path of the Keystone pipeline near Winnsboro, Texas. Eight people stood on tree platforms just ahead of where crews were cutting down trees to make way for the pipeline.[10]
On October 4, 2012, actress and activist Daryl Hannah and 78-year-old Texas landowner Eleanor Fairchild were arrested for criminal trespassing and other charges after they were accused of standing in front of TransCanada pipeline construction equipment on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.[11] Ms. Fairchild has owned the land since 1983 and refused to sign any agreements with TransCanada. Her land was seized by eminent domain.
On April 2, 2016, a resident near Freeman, South Dakota observed a leak along the Keystone pipeline. The size and cause were not immediately known.[12]
British Columbia gas export pipelines[edit]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[13][14]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[14] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[15][16][17][18]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[13] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[19]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[13][15]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[20]
Power market[edit]
TransCanada also owns, or has interests in, approximately 11,800 megawatts of power generation.[4]
Economic withholding[edit]
Economic withholding is defined as the practice of submitting blocks of electricity at high, non-competitive prices that effectively reduces or withholds the quantity of supply offered at competitive prices. Generators "offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid" but they raise the price so high the electricity is not dispatched.[21] In this way economic withholding is "an exercise of market power" which intentionally raise prices above competitive levels.[22]:5
In Alberta, Canada, through the practice of economic withholding a single electricity provider drove up prices on four occasions in May and June, of 2015 during a period of surplus power supply.[21]

Power generators are required to offer their available electricity to the market for dispatch on the grid, but they can choose the price they want for it. If it is priced too high, it might not be dispatched.
— Darcy Henton Calgary Herald 5 September 2015

A single market participant, TransCanadaEnergy Ltd successfully withheld "much of its available power output on four occasions in May and June 2015 despite there being a surplus supply of power. In response to concerns about the spike in the price of electricity TransCanada's Davis Sheremata claimed that the company "applies our view of prevailing market fundamentals when offering power into the wholesale market."[21]
Power plants[edit]

Sponsorships[edit]
In 2014, Transcanada sponsored the Grand Final event held in Edmonton, Canada for the 2014 ITU World Triathlon Series.[25] In 2015 the company was a major sponsor for the 2015 World U-17 Hockey Challenge held in Dawson Creek and Fort St. John, British Columbia.[26] Transcanada committed $25,000 in sponsorship funding to assist the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the maintenance of the Iron Belle Trail. The company adopted a 2 kilometres (1 mile) long stretch of the trail in Kalkaska County, Michigan near an ANR Pipeline facility.[27]

As of June 2013 these projects remain subject to regulatory approval and licensing.[13][14]

In June 2012 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Shell and partners Korea Gas Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation and PetroChina Company Limited to design, build, own and operate[14] the Coastal GasLink pipeline between northeastern B.C. oil fields near Dawson Creek, British Columbia and an LNG facility export facility on the Douglas Channel near Kitimat, British Columbia.[15][16][17][18]
In January 2013 it was announced that TransCanada was selected by Petronas to design, build, own, and operate[13] the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission project, a gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the Montney region near Fort St. John, British Columbia to a LNG terminal planned by Progress Energy Canada Ltd. in Port Edward, British Columbia on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.[19]
TransCanada's existing NGTL system in northeastern B.C. will be expanded and integrated into the new export pipeline systems.[13][15]
Pipelines in Alberta[edit]
In October 2012, TransCanada formed a 50-50 CAD$3bn joint-venture with Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. (the Canadian subsidiary of PetroChina) to develop the 500 km Grand Rapids Pipeline.[20]

TransCanada PipeLines Limited
TransCanada PipeLines Limited, a natural gas transmission company with executive offices in Toronto.

















TransCanada PipeLines Limited, a natural gas transmission company with executive offices in Toronto. First incorporated by Act of Parliament on 21 March 1951, TransCanada owns and operates a high pressure natural gas pipeline system extending from Alberta into parts of Québec and into the US. The company is also engaged in the search for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas, and sells natural gas to Canadian and US customers. With the federal government's deregulation of gas prices, the company expanded its marketing operations with its subsidiary Western Gas Marketing Ltd.


	 In 1988 it made a successful bid for Encor Energy Corp Inc, the largest shareholder of which was debt-plagued Dome Petroleum. In 1995 it had sales or operating revenue of $7.0 billion, assets of $10.3 billion and over 1700 employees. Shares in the company are widely held and foreign ownership stands at 30%. Bell Canada Enterprises Inc owned 49% of the shares. In February 1998 it merged with Nova Corp, creating North America's 4th-largest gas pipeline company.
