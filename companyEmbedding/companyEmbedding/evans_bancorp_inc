He also served as a judge for Erie County Family Court in Buffalo, N.Y.
In private practice, Mr. Battle has provided counsel on numerous cases involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Healthcare Fraud, the False Claims Act, and disadvantaged business regulatory violations, in addition to his current focus.
