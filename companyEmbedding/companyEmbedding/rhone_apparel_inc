Its product line is intended for high-income, active men between 25 and 50 years of age, who look for activewear that is functional and attractive. The company uses premium custom fabrics, which include silver thread that provides permanent antibacterial and anti-odorant protection.[1][2]
All of Rhone's products are designed in Portland and New York, with warehouses in California, Utah, and New Jersey.[3] Rhone has been called "2016's hottest men's activewear brand."[4]

History[edit]
Rhone was founded in New Canaan, Connecticut, in 2014 by Nate Checketts, an ex-NFL employee, Kyle McClure, a former NCAA lacrosse player, and two other founders.[5] The company's name comes from the river and region in Europe.[6] The founders were inspired by the fact that the Rhône is not only aesthetically beautiful, but was also highly functional for the surrounding civilizations.[7]
The company launched as a web-only retailer, but partnered with Bloomingdale's in November 2014 to sell in five locations. In 2015, it entered 127 retail storefronts, selling at such retailers as Nordstrom, Equinox and CorePower Yoga.[8] Rhone launched its first pop-up store in New York City.[9]
Rhone experienced sharp growth in 2015. In the month of November, it earned 62% of its 2014 revenue. Its website traffic rose by 350% from 2014 to 2015.[1] Wholesale became the primary driver of the company's 500% growth over the year before that.[8]
The company announced the closing of a $5 million Series A financing in September 2015. The investors came from sports, media and fashion circles, including Steve Bornstein, David Stern, Ryen Russillo, and Shane Battier.[4] Since its launch, Rhone has raised a total of $6.2 million.[8]
In February 2016, Rhone organized the purchase of a building from 1892 in Stamford to convert it to a new headquarters.[10] At the time, about 65% of its business was online.[1]
Profile and products[edit]
Rhone is targeting sophisticated, high-income, active men that look for activewear that is both functional and attractive.[9] Its targeted demographic is between 25 and 50 years of age.[1] Its buyers are diverse, including a unit that defuses bombs in Afghanistan as well as marathon winners.[6] The fitness clothes can also be used for day-to-day activities.[11]
The company's product line aims to separate the brand from competitors like Lululemon, Nike and Under Armour, whose premium men's offerings are more generic and less available.[4] The company uses superior materials in order to create clothes that last longer than the average product. While the average mass brands spend between $2 and $4 a yard for fabrics, some of Rhone's fabrics cost $15 per yard.[6][1]
When the company founders began researching antimicrobial fabrics, they found that weaving silver into cloth created permanent antibacterial and anti-odorant protection, unlike typical anti-odorant treatments which last for 15 to 20 washes.[2] SilverTech is the brand name of the silver thread that is woven into the company's fabrics.[3] In fact, silver has been used as an antiseptic since Hippocrates. The kind of silver threading Rhone uses was initially developed by the American military for soldiers in Iraq.[12] When it launched, Rhone got numerous orders from army bases, as captains were ordering the gear for troops to wear during training.[5]
Clothing details include strategically placed breathable mesh venting panels;[13] silicone gel on the drawstring;[12] a media pocket; and a thick, tall and padded waistband on the shorts.[14] The clothes have stitched-in inspirational messages, such as "Don't Die Without a Few Scars" or "What We Do in Life Echoes in Eternity."[14] Flatlock stitching, where the seams lie flat with edges of fabric butting together rather than folding together, is used to avoid chafing.[1] The Polartec Power Dry patented construction creates a fabric that is quick wicking to improve breathability and performance.[4] The clothes have a combination of open and zippered pockets. The fit is a medium between XXL and compression.[15]
Other apparel includes the Rhone Flask, which keeps drinks cold for 24 hours and hot for 12 hours.[1]
Rhone's style names come from masculine icons, like the Durden T-shirt after "Fight Club" character Tyler Durden,[15] or the Mako short after the shark from The Old Man and the Sea.[6]

Rhone Launches Holiday Pop-Up Shop in SoHo, NYC
Oct 26 15
Rhone announced its first foray into brick & mortar with the launch of their Holiday pop-up shop in New York City's SoHo neighborhood. Rhone worked with Thor Equities to secure the temporary holiday space located at 292 Lafayette St. which officially opened its doors to the public on October 15, 2015 and will remain open through January 15, 2016. Bringing their retail vision to life, Rhone partnered with interior design and architecture firm, Reform Creative, whose clients include Bonobos, Partners & Spade, Trunk Club and Warby Parker. Drawing inspiration from city infrastructure and the contrast of old and new, Reform Creative collaborated with local custom cabinetmaker, Stand & Build, to develop custom blackened steel and diamond pattern metal mesh fixtures that emulate the Rhone brand ethos of form and function.

Men’s Workout Clothes, Fitness Apparel & Premium Activewear
Shop our newest Rhone premium mens activewear products that have been designed & engineered to provide comfort and quality. It doesn’t matter if your busy life requires long hours at the office, international business trips, climbing the highest mountains or surfing the best waves around the world. Rhone is premium men’s athletic apparel and gear for every active lifestyle. Looking for the best gym clothes for men? Look no further. Rhone is perfect for the gym, yoga, cross-training, biking or any other sweaty activity.
Explore our latest collections of workout clothing for men, activewear, running shorts, fitness apparel, and premium outerwear. Each collection is designed exclusively for men who live #ForeverForward. We source premium Rhone fabrics across many continents to provide high performance activewear for men that endures rough terrains and intense gym workouts. We were tired of men being an afterthought for premium sportswear and being stuck with subpar ‘serve everyone’ brands where quality and fit is not paramount. We decided to do something about it. We were tired of men's workout clothes being an afterthought. That is the founding principle of Rhone and here is our promise: Rhone men’s premium activewear and workout clothes will always look good and perform even better.
A Modern Man Demands Modern Style & Quality
Our design team carefully engineers premium activewear & sportswear for runners, professional athletes, and men who strive to push themselves in every aspect of their life. Whether you prefer the term “athleisure” or not, Rhone will keep men performing at their best. We produce the best anti-odor and anti-stink shirts for guys who workout, the best workout shorts, running shorts for runners and boardshorts for surfers. Everything in our collections serves a unique purpose, from the anti-stink no-show socks, mid-calf socks, water bottles/flasks to all other accessories. What makes us different? Our technology. We aren't satisfied with just being awarded the best anti-stink activewear by GQ, we decided to push the boundaries even further. Forbes recently published that, “Rhone has firmly cemented itself as 2016’s hottest men’s activewear brand.” With over 1000 5-star reviews, we appreciate the feedback and our loyal customers. Subscribe to our email list and you’ll receive updates on the new product releases, upcoming pop-up locations, as well as special promotional offers. New product lines are released exclusively to our email list before anywhere else. We welcome you to the community of Rhone fans and ambassadors who live our brand ethos on a daily basis.
From working hard at the office to yoga and everything in between, Rhone engineers the best fitness apparel and workout gear for men. Rhone has top of the line outerwear including baselayers, jackets and hoodies. No matter if you are searching for workout clothes, winter outerwear, or the perfect pair of running shorts to destroy your next marathon - Rhone has you covered. We realize it is an honor to support you in all your adventures and pledge not to compromise on quality. Each year, we partner with the Testicular Cancer Foundation to support male cancer research because it’s time to unite together to eradicate testicular cancer. Our men's workout clothes are rigorously tested by professional trainers and athletes. Our new GoldFusion technology performs better and lasts longer than any anti-odor technology available. It's also completely eco-friendly. Give our gear a try and put it to the test. Show us what you do #WhenInRhone and always push yourself #ForeverForward
Rhone is men’s premium activewear engineered with principle, performance and progress for the modern man. Let us earn a place in your arena.

Learn More About Athletic Shorts for Men

Athletic Shorts Engineered for the Modern Man
Look no further for the perfect athletic shorts. Our shorts are engineered for the modern man and athlete. By using flat lock seams, power stretch material, and our SilverTech and GoldFusion technologies, we have created the perfect shorts for running, cross-training, and yoga. This allows us to to provide the best athletic shorts for men. We have shorts with built in liners to keep you comfortable and secure, amazing pockets to store media devices, hidden pockets to store away important items, and comfort waistbands to make it feel like you aren’t wearing any shorts at all. We also offer our shorts in varieties of inseam lengths.
All of our fabrics are carefully chosen specifically for the role they play in the design. We spend tremendous amounts of time testing and crafting the perfect combination of fabrics to build the perfect short. SilverTech was created to make your shorts dry faster, last longer, and stay fresher than any other shorts on the market. Typical antibacterial and anti-odor treatments used by other brands usually last for only 15-20 washes. SilverTech was permanently built into the actual fabric. GoldFusion is our brand new technology included in the liner of our Phase Shorts which has gold particles fused into the fabric. GoldFusion technology lasts longer (100 washes+) and is completely eco-friendly. 
Don’t miss out on our wide variety of men’s workout apparel including: workout pants for men and men’s workout accessories. Pair your shorts with our perfect tops featuring our: long sleeve shirts, men’s athletic tank tops, and men’s short sleeve t-shirts. Also check out our men’s gym & workout clothing collection.

Running is either loved or very much hated. No matter what, it’s a part of life and one of the biggest parts of staying healthy. We break it down for you here.

Men’s Workout Clothes, Fitness Apparel & Premium Activewear
Shop our newest Rhone premium mens activewear products that have been designed & engineered to provide comfort and quality. It doesn’t matter if your busy life requires long hours at the office, international business trips, climbing the highest mountains or surfing the best waves around the world. Rhone is premium men’s athletic apparel and gear for every active lifestyle. Looking for the best gym clothes for men? Look no further. Rhone is perfect for the gym, yoga, cross-training, biking or any other sweaty activity.
Explore our latest collections of workout clothing for men, activewear, running shorts, fitness apparel, and premium outerwear. Each collection is designed exclusively for men who live #ForeverForward. We source premium Rhone fabrics across many continents to provide high performance activewear for men that endures rough terrains and intense gym workouts. We were tired of men being an afterthought for premium sportswear and being stuck with subpar ‘serve everyone’ brands where quality and fit is not paramount. We decided to do something about it. We were tired of men's workout clothes being an afterthought. That is the founding principle of Rhone and here is our promise: Rhone men’s premium activewear and workout clothes will always look good and perform even better.
A Modern Man Demands Modern Style & Quality
Our design team carefully engineers premium activewear & sportswear for runners, professional athletes, and men who strive to push themselves in every aspect of their life. Whether you prefer the term “athleisure” or not, Rhone will keep men performing at their best. We produce the best anti-odor and anti-stink shirts for guys who workout, the best workout shorts, running shorts for runners and boardshorts for surfers. Everything in our collections serves a unique purpose, from the anti-stink no-show socks, mid-calf socks, water bottles/flasks to all other accessories. What makes us different? Our technology. We aren't satisfied with just being awarded the best anti-stink activewear by GQ, we decided to push the boundaries even further. Forbes recently published that, “Rhone has firmly cemented itself as 2016’s hottest men’s activewear brand.” With over 1000 5-star reviews, we appreciate the feedback and our loyal customers. Subscribe to our email list and you’ll receive updates on the new product releases, upcoming pop-up locations, as well as special promotional offers. New product lines are released exclusively to our email list before anywhere else. We welcome you to the community of Rhone fans and ambassadors who live our brand ethos on a daily basis.
From working hard at the office to yoga and everything in between, Rhone engineers the best fitness apparel and workout gear for men. Rhone has top of the line outerwear including baselayers, jackets and hoodies. No matter if you are searching for workout clothes, winter outerwear, or the perfect pair of running shorts to destroy your next marathon - Rhone has you covered. We realize it is an honor to support you in all your adventures and pledge not to compromise on quality. Each year, we partner with the Testicular Cancer Foundation to support male cancer research because it’s time to unite together to eradicate testicular cancer. Our men's workout clothes are rigorously tested by professional trainers and athletes. Our new GoldFusion technology performs better and lasts longer than any anti-odor technology available. It's also completely eco-friendly. Give our gear a try and put it to the test. Show us what you do #WhenInRhone and always push yourself #ForeverForward
Rhone is men’s premium activewear engineered with principle, performance and progress for the modern man. Let us earn a place in your arena.

Men’s Workout Clothes, Fitness Apparel & Premium Activewear
Shop our newest Rhone premium mens activewear products that have been designed & engineered to provide comfort and quality. It doesn’t matter if your busy life requires long hours at the office, international business trips, climbing the highest mountains or surfing the best waves around the world. Rhone is premium men’s athletic apparel and gear for every active lifestyle. Looking for the best gym clothes for men? Look no further. Rhone is perfect for the gym, yoga, cross-training, biking or any other sweaty activity.
Explore our latest collections of workout clothing for men, activewear, running shorts, fitness apparel, and premium outerwear. Each collection is designed exclusively for men who live #ForeverForward. We source premium Rhone fabrics across many continents to provide high performance activewear for men that endures rough terrains and intense gym workouts. We were tired of men being an afterthought for premium sportswear and being stuck with subpar ‘serve everyone’ brands where quality and fit is not paramount. We decided to do something about it. We were tired of men's workout clothes being an afterthought. That is the founding principle of Rhone and here is our promise: Rhone men’s premium activewear and workout clothes will always look good and perform even better.
A Modern Man Demands Modern Style & Quality
Our design team carefully engineers premium activewear & sportswear for runners, professional athletes, and men who strive to push themselves in every aspect of their life. Whether you prefer the term “athleisure” or not, Rhone will keep men performing at their best. We produce the best anti-odor and anti-stink shirts for guys who workout, the best workout shorts, running shorts for runners and boardshorts for surfers. Everything in our collections serves a unique purpose, from the anti-stink no-show socks, mid-calf socks, water bottles/flasks to all other accessories. What makes us different? Our technology. We aren't satisfied with just being awarded the best anti-stink activewear by GQ, we decided to push the boundaries even further. Forbes recently published that, “Rhone has firmly cemented itself as 2016’s hottest men’s activewear brand.” With over 1000 5-star reviews, we appreciate the feedback and our loyal customers. Subscribe to our email list and you’ll receive updates on the new product releases, upcoming pop-up locations, as well as special promotional offers. New product lines are released exclusively to our email list before anywhere else. We welcome you to the community of Rhone fans and ambassadors who live our brand ethos on a daily basis.
From working hard at the office to yoga and everything in between, Rhone engineers the best fitness apparel and workout gear for men. Rhone has top of the line outerwear including baselayers, jackets and hoodies. No matter if you are searching for workout clothes, winter outerwear, or the perfect pair of running shorts to destroy your next marathon - Rhone has you covered. We realize it is an honor to support you in all your adventures and pledge not to compromise on quality. Each year, we partner with the Testicular Cancer Foundation to support male cancer research because it’s time to unite together to eradicate testicular cancer. Our men's workout clothes are rigorously tested by professional trainers and athletes. Our new GoldFusion technology performs better and lasts longer than any anti-odor technology available. It's also completely eco-friendly. Give our gear a try and put it to the test. Show us what you do #WhenInRhone and always push yourself #ForeverForward
Rhone is men’s premium activewear engineered with principle, performance and progress for the modern man. Let us earn a place in your arena.

Learn More About Men’s Short Sleeve Workout Shirts

Top Performing Workout Short Sleeve Shirts For Men
We have tested, researched, and received extensive customer feedback in order to design and build the best performing men’s short sleeve workout shirts on the market. We use only the best anti-odor, moisture wicking, and breathable fabrics to create our workout clothing. Having these qualities built into your workout apparel will make it last longer and perform like you wouldn’t believe. Details matters, especially in workout clothing for men. Our advanced fabric technology has been created specifically to help your shirts dry faster, fight odor, and perform better than the leading industry giants. We spend up to 4 times more on fabrics than the big box brands. This is exactly why men trust our brand because we choose performance over profit.
SilverTech uses silver fibers woven into the very fabrics of Rhone’s workout shirts. Our brand new GoldFusion technology takes gold particles and fuses with our fabrics which increase drying time significantly and stay fresh longer. Why does this matter? Well, because men sweat… a lot. Sweat should not hold you back when you need that extra motivation to continue forward. This is what truly makes Rhone unique along with our commitment of technology and innovation for men’s fitness apparel.
We have a full collection of men’s athletic wear. See our specific tops for: long sleeve activewear, men’s workout tank tops, and fitness hoodies for men.
Pair your workout tops with the perfect: workout shorts for men or our men’s workout pants. Also check out our new men’s activewear all in one place.



How To Train Like An Athlete
Rise to the top as we take you through how to train like an athlete. You have to expect things of yourself before you can do them” - Michael Jordan.

Here at Rhone, we work tirelessly on product innovation, technology and staying on top of the latest trends in men’s activewear. Easily find our new products here and learn what makes them different. Recently, we launched our GoldFusion product line that fuses gold particles into the fabric of the apparel. This provides better performance all around and helps your workout clothes stay fresh by drying faster, and lasts longer than any competition. We are passionate about keeping quality, comfort, and performance in all of our workout clothes and apparel. GQ ranked our men’s activewear the best odor-fighting fitness apparel on the market, and we plan on living up to that each and every day.
From the cut of the fabric to the final packaging, we inspect every detail to make sure we deliver in quality, performance, and comfort. We offer new colors each season that you’re sure to love.
Shop our full collection of men’s workout apparel ranging from workout shirts for men, men’s athletic pants, workout accessories for men, and curate kits. These kits provide an incredible value while removing any of the guesswork needed to select outfits.
See our men’s premium fitness tops: men's short sleeve workout shirts, long sleeve activewear, men’s workout tank tops, and, fitness hoodies for men.
Also shop our men’s premium workout bottoms: men’s athletic pants, workout shorts for men, compression clothing for men, and men’s board shorts.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
