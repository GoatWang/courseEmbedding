Beware the New Sprott Silver Fund | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Beware the New Sprott Silver FundJul. 20, 2010  9:11 AM ET|| Includes: GLD, IAU, PHYS, SIVR, SLVby: Michael JohnstonMichael Johnston No corner of the ETF market has grown as quickly in recent years as exchange-traded commodities, as investors have embraced cheap and efficient exposure to an asset class that has historically been out-of-reach for all but the biggest and most sophisticated. Perhaps due to the uncertain economic environment, precious metals funds have become particularly popular, offering a safe haven for those concerned about the strength on the current recovery. While some ETPs offer exposure to gold and silver through futures-backed funds, most investors prefer physically-backed ETFs that will generally move in lock step with spot commodity prices.  There is no shortage of ETF products utilizing this strategy, both in the gold ETF and silver ETF space. In coming months, investors may see another option out there designed with a unique sparkle designed to catch their eye. But before jumping in to a “new and improved” precious metals ETF, they would benefit from doing a little homework. Sprott Inc. has filed a preliminary prospectus with both the SEC and SEDAR (Canada’s equivalent of the SEC) for the Sprott Physical Silver Trust, a fund that Dorothy Kosich notes will be “aimed at giving investors the liquidity of an ETF combined with silver bullion exposure.” At first, the new product from Sprott sounds an awful lot like SLV or SIVR, the existing silver ETF products offered by iShares and ETF Securities. According to the prospectus, the trust is designed “to invest and hold substantially all of its assets in physical silver bullion,” seeking to “provide a secure, convenient and exchange-traded investment alternative for investors interested in holding physical silver bullion without the inconvenience that is typical of a direct investment in physical silver bullion.” It gets better from there. The prospectus for the proposed silver product goes on to outline that investors will be able to redeem units for physical silver bullion on a monthly basis and will provide potential tax advantages for certain investors. That second element may sound particularly appealing; currently silver and gold are subject to taxation as “collectibles,” meaning that the effective rate can be significantly higher than the long-term capital gains tax of 15%.
 If all of that sounds too good to be true, that’s because it probably is. Earlier this year Sprott launched its Physical Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:PHYS), a product that boasted many of the same benefits of the proposed silver trust. By most measures, PHYS has been a phenomenal success; it holds almost 600,000 ounces of gold and total assets are currently hovering around $700 million. But PHYS certainly won’t be confused for GLD or IAU. According to the fund’s web site, PHYS currently trades at a premium of about 12% to its NAV. During the second quarter, that premium has ranged from 6% to 23%, meaning that the gold trust has exhibited significantly more volatility than spot gold prices. Moreover, returns to investors may depend more heavily on their timing of the NAV premium than the price of gold bullion. Suddenly the ability to redeem outstanding units for physical bullion at a price equal to NAV loses a bit of its luster (for the record, ETFdb didn’t immediately see through PHYS; the folks at IU did a nice piece explaining all the nuances, including why the potential tax benefits will be a mirage to most investors). For investors looking for a way to establish exposure to silver prices, ETFs remain (and will continue to remain) the most attractive options. The new silver product from Sprott may have some characteristics of an ETF, but will more closely resemble a closed-end fund where it counts. By sticking to SLV or SIVR, investors will steer clear of the premium/discount issue and can even save a few basis points on the expense ratio.  Disclosure: No positions at time of writing.

Why Invest in Silver?
 "All that glitters is gold was written when gold was still considered a relic in financial circles.  We believe silver will be this decade's gold, and judging by the recent price action, it's already off to a great start." - Eric Sprott, Markets at a Glance, All That Glitters is Silver, November 2010
Silver bullion may assist in protecting a portfolio from currency devaluation and inflation. Silver has been used throughout human history as a store of monetary value, and as such enjoys investment demand for its monetary utility. Silver's unique qualities also make it considerably useful in a large number of industrial applications, thus making it one of the few monetary metals that also enjoy a commodity driven demand profile.
• Increasing instability in the U.S. dollar • Disproportionate silver investment in relation to gold • Limited physical supply • Increasing investment demand for physical silver • Silver's unique fundamentals

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
