ASCENT



















INTRO






One to three bedroom apartments in South San Jose off Hwy 85 and across from the light rail station
Ascent is a place where thoughtful architecture and design provides the foundation for comfort and luxury. A concept derived from the juxtaposition of mid-century modern design combined with the connectivity of today’s most modern conveniences. Ascent portrays the modernism of 1950’s California architecture reflective of the former Hitachi campus and incorporates fresh ideas true to a mid-century living environment, allowing for fresh, innovative and vivid features.
Ascent's distinct blend of bold colors, clean lines, and abundant natural lighting provides a comforting feeling of openness and mobility. You will appreciate the revival of mid-century design through the harmonious proportions and geometric patterns appropriately placed throughout the property. From the dramatized entrances, the park on the green, and the large tensile structures, the memorable elements and meticulous attention to detail emphasize the timeless beauty of the design. Attentive strokes of red spread throughout the property serve as a striking core to the distinct color pallet, offering each area a trendy, artistic component.
Residents have multiple ways to interact with each other through strategically placed gathering places and high tech amenities. Ascent redefines apartment living with its eclectic eco-friendly combination of contemporary styling with a historic basis. The property is 100% smoke-free and the interior spaces are well-designed and exquisitely decorated, bright and spacious - this is inspired living!

Amazing South San Jose location - just off Hwy 85 and next to the new Village Oaks Retail Center with over 320,000 square feet of neighborhood retail including Target, major supermarket, restaurants and boutiques as well as across the street from the Cottle Light Rail Station and less than a mile to the Blossom Hill Caltrain Station and Kaiser Medical
Every imaginable amenity including a resident lounge, gaming, e-business centers, office pods, pet spa, 4,000 sq. ft. fitness center including a spin room and much, much more
Incredible outdoor entertainment areas covered by a tensile structure with TV's and audio featuring a resort-style pool, half-acre park on the green, kitchen and bar with pizza oven, outdoor gaming areas and bark park
Three schemes of contemporary interior finishes including flat panel cabinetry, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, designer lighting and wood style vinyl plank flooring throughout
Awarded the Gold Award in the category of "Development up to 4 Stories, For Rent" from the 2016 Best in American Living Awards (BALA) by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
Builditgreen Certified - Eco-friendly features including smoke-free living, Energy-star appliances, quartz countertops, low VOC paints and carpet, and much more

SILICON VALLEY, CA
ASCENT



















INTRO






One to three bedroom apartments in South San Jose off Hwy 85 and across from the light rail station
Ascent is a place where thoughtful architecture and design provides the foundation for comfort and luxury. A concept derived from the juxtaposition of mid-century modern design combined with the connectivity of today’s most modern conveniences. Ascent portrays the modernism of 1950’s California architecture reflective of the former Hitachi campus and incorporates fresh ideas true to a mid-century living environment, allowing for fresh, innovative and vivid features.
Ascent's distinct blend of bold colors, clean lines, and abundant natural lighting provides a comforting feeling of openness and mobility. You will appreciate the revival of mid-century design through the harmonious proportions and geometric patterns appropriately placed throughout the property. From the dramatized entrances, the park on the green, and the large tensile structures, the memorable elements and meticulous attention to detail emphasize the timeless beauty of the design. Attentive strokes of red spread throughout the property serve as a striking core to the distinct color pallet, offering each area a trendy, artistic component.
Residents have multiple ways to interact with each other through strategically placed gathering places and high tech amenities. Ascent redefines apartment living with its eclectic eco-friendly combination of contemporary styling with a historic basis. The property is 100% smoke-free and the interior spaces are well-designed and exquisitely decorated, bright and spacious - this is inspired living!

Amazing South San Jose location - just off Hwy 85 and next to the new Village Oaks Retail Center with over 320,000 square feet of neighborhood retail including Target, major supermarket, restaurants and boutiques as well as across the street from the Cottle Light Rail Station and less than a mile to the Blossom Hill Caltrain Station and Kaiser Medical
Every imaginable amenity including a resident lounge, gaming, e-business centers, office pods, pet spa, 4,000 sq. ft. fitness center including a spin room and much, much more
Incredible outdoor entertainment areas covered by a tensile structure with TV's and audio featuring a resort-style pool, half-acre park on the green, kitchen and bar with pizza oven, outdoor gaming areas and bark park
Three schemes of contemporary interior finishes including flat panel cabinetry, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, designer lighting and wood style vinyl plank flooring throughout
Awarded the Gold Award in the category of "Development up to 4 Stories, For Rent" from the 2016 Best in American Living Awards (BALA) by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
Builditgreen Certified - Eco-friendly features including smoke-free living, Energy-star appliances, quartz countertops, low VOC paints and carpet, and much more

Monitronics Begins New Era Of Smart Home Security; Rebrands As "MONI"
New Name Reflects the Company's Evolution as a Smart Home Security Solutions Organization with Faster, More Personalized Offerings


DALLAS, Sept. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Monitronics, a subsidiary of Ascent Capital Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASCMA) today unveiled its new name: "MONI," beginning a new era of smart home security that brings increased speed and personalization to the market.

The Company has been the "secret sauce" behind more than 600 independent alarm companies' successes for the past two decades, with a cutting-edge monitoring solution that secures more than one million residential customers and commercial client accounts in the US.  However, "Monitronics" was intentionally unbranded in the eyes of the consumer, allowing independent dealer brands to take center stage. The new MONI brand will be marketed directly to consumers and supported by direct-to-consumer sales and customer support. This will not only enable MONI's expert custom solutions to flow directly into the home, but is designed to nurture MONI's trusted dealer network by showing consumers the strength behind the individual dealer brands.

Ascent Capital Group, Inc. Company Profile

   Ascent Capital Group, formerly Ascent Media, has a different mountain to climb. Historically the holding company operated through subsidiary Ascent Media Group (AMG), which provided an array of services for the film and TV industries in the US, the UK, and Singapore. However, in 2010 Ascent Media switched gears and acquired security alarm monitoring company Monitronics International for about $1.2 billion. It sold AMG Creative and Media Services (primarily post-production-related businesses) in late 2010 and AMG Content Distribution-related services in 2011. Strategic alternatives are being pursued for AMG's remaining Systems Integration unit.

Ascent Capital Group is a public holding company[2] whose primary subsidiary is Monitronics. Ascent Media was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Discovery Holding Company (DHC). DHC spun off Ascent Media as an independent, public company on September 17, 2008.[3]
The company's main activity through its wholly owned subsidiary, Monitroincs, is to provide security alarm monitoring services to more than 1 million residential and commercial customers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico through its nationwide network of independent dealers.[citation needed]
History[edit]
In its past, Ascent Capital Group provided creative and technical services to the media and entertainment industries.[4] Ascent Media was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Discovery Holding Company (DHC). DHC spun off Ascent Media as an independent, public company on September 17, 2008.[3]
The assets and operations of Ascent Capital Group are composed primarily of the assets and operations of various businesses acquired from 2000 through 2004, including The Todd-AO Corporation, Four Media Company, Video Services Corporation, Group W Network Services, London Playout Centre and the systems integration business of Sony Electronics. The combination and integration of these and other acquired entities allows AMG to offer integrated outsourcing for the technical and creative requirements of its clients, from content creation and other post-production services to media management and transmission of the final product to broadcast television stations, cable system head-ends and other destinations and distribution points."[5]

1999: Ascent Media formed through the acquisition of three post-production companies: Todd-AO Corporation, Four Media Company, and certain assets of Soundelux Entertainment Group using Liberty Media stock valued at more than $400 million US dollars.
2005: Ascent Media announces deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to convert Sony's library of more than 4,000 films and many of its vintage TV shows into digital files. "As envisioned by Sony and Ascent Media, files that are now delivered manually to distributors such as the Starz Encore pay-TV service would be transferred instead as digital files over a secure network."[6]
2006: Discovery Holding Company acquires AccentHealth to be overseen by Ascent Media. Discovery Holding's press release reported, "Delivered to over 11,200 medical waiting rooms nationwide, AccentHealth's programming and sponsor messages are delivered to over 19 million health conscious consumers each month."[7]
2007: During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Board of Directors of DHC approved a resolution to spin off the capital stock of AMC to the holders of DHC Series A and Series B common stock. Each owner of Series A common stock is allowed 1 vote per share of voting power and Series B common stock owners are allowed 10 votes per share.[8]
2008: On September 4, 2008, Ascent Media completed the sale of 100% of the ownership interests in AccentHealth to an unaffiliated third party for net cash proceeds of $118,643,000.
2008: The AMC Spin Off was completed on September 17, 2008. Following the AMC Spin Off, AMC and DHC operate independently, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other.[5]
2008: Ascent Media Group's Creative Sound Services group spun off from Discovery Holding Company to create CSS Studios, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Discovery Communications. This included the assets of Todd-AO, Soundelux, Sound One, POP Sound, Modern Music, Soundelux Design Music Group and The Hollywood Edge.[9]
2010: In December 2010, Ascent Media acquired Monitronics, a home security system company.[10]
2011: On February 28, 2011, Encompass Digital Media, Inc. purchased Ascent Media's global content distribution business, including facilities in: New York metro area, Minnesota, Burbank, London and Singapore.[11] On July 7, 2011, Ascent Media Corporation merged with its subsidiary, Ascent Capital Group, Inc., for the purpose of changing its name to Ascent Capital Group, Inc.[1]
2012: On October 26, 2012, Monitronics acquired approximately 93,000 security alarm monitoring subscriber accounts representing $4.4 million of gross recurring monthly revenue from Pinnacle Security for a purchase price of $131 million.[12]

ASCENT



















INTRO






One to three bedroom apartments in South San Jose off Hwy 85 and across from the light rail station
Ascent is a place where thoughtful architecture and design provides the foundation for comfort and luxury. A concept derived from the juxtaposition of mid-century modern design combined with the connectivity of today’s most modern conveniences. Ascent portrays the modernism of 1950’s California architecture reflective of the former Hitachi campus and incorporates fresh ideas true to a mid-century living environment, allowing for fresh, innovative and vivid features.
Ascent's distinct blend of bold colors, clean lines, and abundant natural lighting provides a comforting feeling of openness and mobility. You will appreciate the revival of mid-century design through the harmonious proportions and geometric patterns appropriately placed throughout the property. From the dramatized entrances, the park on the green, and the large tensile structures, the memorable elements and meticulous attention to detail emphasize the timeless beauty of the design. Attentive strokes of red spread throughout the property serve as a striking core to the distinct color pallet, offering each area a trendy, artistic component.
Residents have multiple ways to interact with each other through strategically placed gathering places and high tech amenities. Ascent redefines apartment living with its eclectic eco-friendly combination of contemporary styling with a historic basis. The property is 100% smoke-free and the interior spaces are well-designed and exquisitely decorated, bright and spacious - this is inspired living!

Amazing South San Jose location - just off Hwy 85 and next to the new Village Oaks Retail Center with over 320,000 square feet of neighborhood retail including Target, major supermarket, restaurants and boutiques as well as across the street from the Cottle Light Rail Station and less than a mile to the Blossom Hill Caltrain Station and Kaiser Medical
Every imaginable amenity including a resident lounge, gaming, e-business centers, office pods, pet spa, 4,000 sq. ft. fitness center including a spin room and much, much more
Incredible outdoor entertainment areas covered by a tensile structure with TV's and audio featuring a resort-style pool, half-acre park on the green, kitchen and bar with pizza oven, outdoor gaming areas and bark park
Three schemes of contemporary interior finishes including flat panel cabinetry, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, designer lighting and wood style vinyl plank flooring throughout
Awarded the Gold Award in the category of "Development up to 4 Stories, For Rent" from the 2016 Best in American Living Awards (BALA) by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
Builditgreen Certified - Eco-friendly features including smoke-free living, Energy-star appliances, quartz countertops, low VOC paints and carpet, and much more

SILICON VALLEY, CA
ASCENT



















INTRO






One to three bedroom apartments in South San Jose off Hwy 85 and across from the light rail station
Ascent is a place where thoughtful architecture and design provides the foundation for comfort and luxury. A concept derived from the juxtaposition of mid-century modern design combined with the connectivity of today’s most modern conveniences. Ascent portrays the modernism of 1950’s California architecture reflective of the former Hitachi campus and incorporates fresh ideas true to a mid-century living environment, allowing for fresh, innovative and vivid features.
Ascent's distinct blend of bold colors, clean lines, and abundant natural lighting provides a comforting feeling of openness and mobility. You will appreciate the revival of mid-century design through the harmonious proportions and geometric patterns appropriately placed throughout the property. From the dramatized entrances, the park on the green, and the large tensile structures, the memorable elements and meticulous attention to detail emphasize the timeless beauty of the design. Attentive strokes of red spread throughout the property serve as a striking core to the distinct color pallet, offering each area a trendy, artistic component.
Residents have multiple ways to interact with each other through strategically placed gathering places and high tech amenities. Ascent redefines apartment living with its eclectic eco-friendly combination of contemporary styling with a historic basis. The property is 100% smoke-free and the interior spaces are well-designed and exquisitely decorated, bright and spacious - this is inspired living!

Amazing South San Jose location - just off Hwy 85 and next to the new Village Oaks Retail Center with over 320,000 square feet of neighborhood retail including Target, major supermarket, restaurants and boutiques as well as across the street from the Cottle Light Rail Station and less than a mile to the Blossom Hill Caltrain Station and Kaiser Medical
Every imaginable amenity including a resident lounge, gaming, e-business centers, office pods, pet spa, 4,000 sq. ft. fitness center including a spin room and much, much more
Incredible outdoor entertainment areas covered by a tensile structure with TV's and audio featuring a resort-style pool, half-acre park on the green, kitchen and bar with pizza oven, outdoor gaming areas and bark park
Three schemes of contemporary interior finishes including flat panel cabinetry, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, designer lighting and wood style vinyl plank flooring throughout
Awarded the Gold Award in the category of "Development up to 4 Stories, For Rent" from the 2016 Best in American Living Awards (BALA) by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
Builditgreen Certified - Eco-friendly features including smoke-free living, Energy-star appliances, quartz countertops, low VOC paints and carpet, and much more
