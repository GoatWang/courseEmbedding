Web Filtering For Schools

























 Shhh...Securly for Chromebooks is now FREE!
                LEARN MORE




















Web Filtering for Schools
Get Started




















Any Device. Anywhere.




Cloud Based Web Filtering
Delivered through the cloud, Securly provides both in-school and take-home filtering through the same admin console.




Chromebook Filtering
Zero-touch filtering of 1:1 take home Chromebooks using a Chrome extension that takes seconds to deploy. No proxying. No SSL certificates.




1:1 iPads, Windows, & Macs
Support for any heterogeneous mix of 1:1 devices including iPads, Windows, Macs, and Android/Nexus tablets.




Take-home Policies
Location based policies for take-home 1:1 devices when the devices are off school premises.


Learn More 

















SSL Decryption

Distributing certificates to end hosts on your network is all it takes to get Securly to decrypt SSL. We decrypt only those sites that we need to (50-100 out of millions) and have a set of instances dedicated to decryption that auto-scale in the cloud - so you should not have to worry about performance. This specific requirement tends to be a choke point for appliances that do not selectively decrypt and do not have the ability to auto-scale.


















Cyber Bullying and Self Harm Detection


Securly is the first product to audit student posts on Facebook, Twitter and Google+. We also employ cutting edge natural language processing algorithms to flag activity on these networks that might be indicative of cyber bullying or self harm.
                            
Learn More 


















Google and AD Single Sign-On

Securly is the industry's first web-filter to integrate with both Google Apps for Education and Active Directory for authentication, auditing and granular policies.
Learn More 


















YouTube for Schools

We proactively turn on safety modes for the most commonly used 21st century classroom tools.
Learn More 


















Granular K-12 Policies.




School Focused Filter Categories
Instead of filtering across 100s of categories and making policies hard to manage, we have focused on a handful that matter the most to K-12.




Per User Policies
We authenticate with Google Apps or Active Directory to give users policies based on which OU they belong to.




Granular White & Black Lists
We support policy exceptions at both the per-policy level and globally.




Whitelist-only Mode
Admins have the option of blocking all but a handful of sites for students who are considered "at risk".


Guest Network Policies
We are able to provide policies without the need to authenticate on unique NAT-ed IP addresses.


Learn More 





















Teacher Centric Features

Admins can allow teachers to temporarily or permanently whitelist individual sites as exceptions to an entire blocked category.
Say, what’s that in the clouds? Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Actually, it’s Securly, and they are here to rescue teachers of Massac Unit #1 School District – located in Metropolis, IL, home to Superman – from the danger posed by the evil appliance web filter.
“This is precisely how we felt after making the move to Securly”, says Tom Walker, Director of Technology for Massac. "We felt compelled to go with Securly because of its teacher-friendly benefits. For example, if teachers come across a blocked site, they can simply temporarily whitelist the site to grant access for themselves or for their students. As an IT administrator who typically receives numerous support tickets, this made my job a whole lot easier, and my teachers a whole lot happier!"

Can also cover mobile devices that students bring homeOverviewBlocking nasty content has been a bugaboo for the Web since the first picture drifted through the ether. It got worse when YouTube videos flooded into children's devices.Vinay Mahadik and Bharath Madhusudan were engineers at McAfee Software and Huawei-Symantec, software powerhouses that provide security software (such as programs for cleaning up computer viruses). As they and their extended families began to have children, the two engineers began to scrutinize how to protect children from unwanted content using the latest cloud-based techniques. Over the past decade,NetNanny has become a popular solution for parents at home. But the downloadable software was designed for parents at home--not schools--and has yet to cover iOS devices."The same problem parents have at home is amplified in the schools," says Madhusudan.

How it works: Secur.ly is licensed primarily to schools. It resides in the cloud so IT administrators do not need to download any software. It comes with a default policy about what to block although administrators can change those options. It provides different levels of privileges for students, teachers and administrative staff. When a child takes home a mobile device, parents opt to extend the Secur.ly software onto the device while it is at home. It also integrates with Google apps--which means that teachers can use their Google sign-on and ensure that those materials are filtered as well.
Who's using it: Secur.ly has tested its software in approximately 20 pilot schools and is currently working at least five charter schools. It has several paying customers, including AchievementFirst and the Milpitas Unified School district.
Business model: Secur.ly is selling its software directly to schools for $1,500 per year per school. Parents can sign up without charge to have the software cover mobile devices that children bring home from school. Eventually the company hopes to offer a purely commercial version that would likely have a subscription fee of less than $9 a month.
Competition: Some schools buy security devices to attach to their network for a fixed cost (which is spread across the device's lifespan of typically four years). Such devices might also involve additional subscription fees to stay current.
Check this out: Security may seem like a headache, but the company sums up its approach with a 2-minute demo video on its home page.
