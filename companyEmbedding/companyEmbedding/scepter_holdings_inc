Scepter Holdings acquires selected Blitz assets from Bankruptcy Court.
Scepter Holdings Inc., of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, has purchased selected assets of Blitz USA, comprising the land, buildings and machinery located in Miami, Oklahoma, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction closed on September 28, 2012.

However, the high number of product liability lawsuits in the US concerns us. It's something we have not witnessed in any other country we sell to around the world.
