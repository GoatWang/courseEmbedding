Investments and Insurance: –
Mutual Funds: – Mutual funds are funds that pool the money of several investors to invest in equity or debt markets. Mutual Funds could be Equity funds, Debt funds or balanced funds. Funds are selected on quantitative parameters like volatality, FAMA Model, risk adjusted returns, rolling return coupled with a qualitative analysis of fund performance and investment styles through regular interactions / due diligence processes with fund managers.

Systematic Investment Plan –The discipline and the tool

Systematic Investment Plan is an approach to investing within managed investments which involves investing a set of amount at regular intervals rather than investing a larger lump sum amount in one shot. By investing this way you are not attempting to capture the highs and lows of the market but rather the cost of your investment is averaged over a period of time. The essence of SIPs is that when the markets fall investors automatically acquire more units. Likewise they acquire lesser units when the market rises. This means that you buy less when the price is high whereas you buy more the price is low. Hence the average cost per unit drops down over a period of time.
Tax Planning: – HDFC Bank offer a number of advantageous tax saving investment options.  
Insurance: – Life insurance is designed to offer financial protection for you and your family during the times of uncertainties. Choose from a range of traditional insurance and unit linked plans designed to help you with your savings, retirement, investment and protection needs.
General Insurance: – Complete protection for your home, travel & more.
Health Insurance: – Complete protection for your health.
Bonds: – A secure investment avenue giving you stable returns with tax benefits.
Equities & Derivatives: – Leverage our vast information repository and transact online.
