Selecta Biosciences, Inc. Reports Data from Ongoing Phase 2 Trial of Lead Candidate, SEL-212, in Development for Chronic Severe Gout
Jun 15 17
Selecta Biosciences, Inc. announced data from its ongoing Phase 2 trial of SEL-212 (SVP-Rapamycin in combination with the uricase enzyme pegsiticase), which is being developed for patients with chronic severe gout. Key observations and findings based upon the clinical data generated through June 12, 2017 from the 60 patients currently enrolled in this open-label, dose ranging Phase 2 trial include: Mitigated anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) after repeat monthly administrations of SEL-212 – The prevention of ADAs in a dose-dependent manner resulted in durable control of serum uric acid (sUA) levels (defined as sUA <6 mg/dl). The clinical data demonstrate a correlation between the prevention of ADAs and the maintenance of pegsiticase activity and serum uric acid control. Demonstrated induction of immune tolerance – A majority of patients in the minimum effective dose group maintained sUA control following three monthly injections of SEL-212 and two monthly “challenge” injections of pegsiticase alone. Maintenance of sUA in the challenge portion of the trial provides evidence at this stage that the use of SVP-Rapamycin is enabling immune tolerance, meaning a prevention of ADAs to pegsiticase, which is typically immunogenic when administered alone. Reduced rate of gout flares with SEL-212 – In the control cohorts receiving pegsiticase alone, within the first month of treatment, 50% of patients reported experiencing a gout flare, which is a sudden and severe attack of pain, inflammation and tenderness of the joints. By comparison, only 15% of patients receiving SEL-212 reported a gout flare in the first month of treatment, with reports declining further in subsequent months. These data also appear to be in contrast with the increased incidence of flares reported in clinical trials involving other urate lowering therapies. Identified minimum effective dose of SEL-212 – A key objective of the Phase 2 trial was to determine a minimum effective monthly dose of the two components of SEL-212 (i.e. pegsiticase and SVP-Rapamycin) through an ascending dose matrix design. A majority of the initial patients dosed with 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase in combination with 0.08 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin maintained sUA control beyond five treatments. As a result, the company has determined this to be a minimum monthly effective dose of SEL-212. Additional patients are now being added to this cohort, and higher dose levels of SVP-Rapamycin are being tested to further determine the dose regimens that may be taken forward into Phase 3. SEL-212 generally well tolerated – Consistent with the expected reduction in immunogenicity of pegsiticase when SVP-Rapamycin doses increase, SEL-212 has been generally well tolerated at clinically active doses. There have been a total of eight serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the trial through June 12, 2017.  Seven were infusion reactions, four of which occurred in the cohorts receiving pegsiticase alone or the lowest dose of SVP-Rapamycin and two of which were due to dosing errors. One additional SAE, cholecystitis, was determined to not be related to the study drug. All of the SAEs were successfully treated and resolved without further issues.

Selecta Biosciences Inc.






Video: Technology Pioneer 2014⎪Werner Cautreels⎪Selecta Biosciences













Werner Cautreels,  President and Chief Executive Officer Location: Massachusetts, USA  Number of employees: 50  Year founded: 2008Selecta Biosciences Inc.  480 Arsenal Street, Building One  Watertown, MA 02472  USAWebsite: www.selectabio.comSelecta Biosciences has developed nanoparticles that are designed to boost the immune system’s response to invaders it should be fighting, and to dampen its response to things it is fighting by mistake.The first application, boosting the immune system’s response, promises to revolutionize the efficacy and production of vaccines. Because the nanoparticles are synthetic, they can be manufactured much faster than traditional vaccines. They will also last longer and will not need to be refrigerated, making it easier to roll out vaccine programmes to areas with unreliable electricity supply.Selecta’s most advanced product, now in human trials, is a vaccine against nicotine addiction. The vaccine works by inducing antibodies to trap nicotine before it can trigger addiction; in effect, after the vaccine, smoking a cigarette should no longer lead to craving. Selecta is also at an earlier stage of working on vaccines against malaria and cancer.Vaccines stimulate the immune system to respond to a specific trigger; the second application of Selecta’s nanoparticles does the opposite, training the immune system to tolerize specific triggers. This promises a new kind of treatment for allergies and autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes. It could also help in orphan diseases and with transplants, where currently the body’s immune response needs to be generally suppressed for the orphan treatment to work or for the transplant not to be rejected.While testing will take several years, Selecta believes its treatments will be quick to manufacture and roll out when efficacy is demonstrated and approval received.
