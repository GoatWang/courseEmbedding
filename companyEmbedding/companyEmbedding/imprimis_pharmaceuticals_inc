	Imprimis
	Pharmaceuticals and SightLife Surgical Sign Agreement for National Launch of Serum Tears™






	 






	Imprimis
	begins roll-out of dry eye disease formulary with innovative autologous serum eye drop program






	 





	San
	Diego, Calif. and Seattle, Wash. – May 2, 2017 – Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: IMMY) (“Imprimis”),
	an ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical company, and SightLife Surgical (“SightLife Surgical”), a cornea-focused organization
	providing comprehensive services to ophthalmic surgeons,

	announced

	the signing of
	an exclusive strategic sales and marketing agreement. Under the agreement, SightLife Surgical will deploy their sales team to
	offer Imprimis’ Serum Tears™ compounded formulations to physicians, large practice groups, surgery centers, hospitals
	and healthcare organizations nationwide. Imprimis’ Serum Tears™ autologous serum eye drops (ASEDs) are prescribed
	for chronic dry eye patients who do not respond to traditional dry eye treatments.




	 




	Patients
	with dry eye severity typically do not respond to conventional therapy and may be considered candidates for autologous serum eye
	drops as a treatment option. Published data

	1,2,3

	have demonstrated the benefits of using an individual’s serum
	found in their blood, which contain antibodies and growth factors, as an eye drop therapy for chronic dry eye. Under the planned
	Imprimis ASEDs program, Serum Tears™ will be available in all 50 states in varying ranges of saline dilution combinations.




	 




	Mark
	L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis, stated, “

	Our goals in

	2017 include the roll-out of
	a formidable array of offerings to compete in the three largest U.S. ophthalmic markets: cataract surgery, glaucoma and dry eye.
	We are pleased to have accelerated the first phase of the launch of our dry eye program by partnering with the largest and most
	prestigious eye bank in the world. Through this exclusive relationship, we expect to reach and serve leading corneal surgeons
	and their patients whose dry eye conditions may be alleviated with our innovative ASEDs offering. Partnering with SightLife Surgical
	represents an important step in our

	strategic plan to efficiently expand our sales presence
	and increase our growing customer base.”





	 




	SightLife
	Surgical provides corneal tissue and medical devices to surgeons around the world who are performing corneal transplant procedures.
	Serum Tears


	™

	may
	be used as a preventative treatment of a transplant for patients who suffer from corneal epithelial defects (i.e. abrasions) caused
	by dry eye, which makes it a valuable product for the surgeons they serve.





	 




	“With
	the assistance of the Imprimis team, we intend to train and deploy our sales team on this innovative product for severe dry eye
	disease,” said Monty Montoya, president and CEO of SightLife Surgical. “This partnership with Imprimis uniquely positions
	us to help the thousands of domestic physicians treating dry eye and makes this important product widely available to patients
	in need of these drops across the country. Imprimis’ Serum Tears™ compounded formulations represent a perfect addition
	to our portfolio and this opportunity aligns with our commitment to bring products to the market that are designed to help ophthalmic
	surgeons provide the best possible outcomes for their patients.”




	 







	 









	 







	 







	About
	Dry Eye Disease






	 





	Dry
	eye is among the most common conditions seen by eye care professionals. Dry eye occurs when the eye does not produce enough tears,
	or when the tears are not of the correct consistency and evaporate too quickly. Inflammation of the surface of the eye may also
	occur. Dry eye disease, also referred to as keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), dysfunctional tear syndrome, lacrimal keratoconjunctivitis,
	evaporative tear deficiency, aqueous tear deficiency, and LASIK-induced neurotrophic epitheliopathy (LNE), can be a temporary
	or chronic condition. Causes for dry eye include inflammatory eye conditions, post-refractive and other ocular surgery, contact
	lens use, decreased hormones associated with aging, and numerous other factors. An estimated

	5.6
	million ocular surgeries were performed in the U.S. in 2016 and over

	40 million Americans wear contact lenses.

	3,4

	It is reported that 20 to 30 million people suffer from mild dry eye, and nine to 12 million have moderate to severe dry
	eye. Although dry eye can impact people of any age, elderly people are frequently affected with a reported five million afflicted
	with DED.

Imprimis Pharmaceuticals Still Has Upside - Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IMMY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Imprimis Pharmaceuticals Still Has UpsideApr. 3.17 | About: Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, (IMMY) Jonathan Faison Long only, biotech, event-drivenSummaryShares have rebounded over 60% from recent lows after near term financing overhang removed.
        Company brings value to healthcare system, doctors, and patients in a unique manner.
        Ophthalmology product launches and growth in currently commercialized products should continue to spur revenue growth.
        Monetisation of unique drug formulations could significantly impact balance sheet.
        Risks include execution in product launches and gaining market share, as well as competition and delayed profitability.
        Shares of tiny life sciences firm Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IMMY) have finished the past year with flat performance, although the stock price has rebounded over 60% from recent lows. 

 IMMY data by YCharts Background Management is currently focused on opportunities in ophthalmology (60% of current revenue mix), although realize significant sales in the areas of integrative medicine (23%) and urology (10%). Through their compounding pharmacies the company offers high quality drug formulations that address unmet patient needs at lower costs without sacrificing quality. 

 Figure 2: No reliance on middle men, transparent business model (source: corporate presentation) The company has over 1,500 ophthalmologist customers and growing, as well as over 27 patents and pending patents. They've experienced 8 quarters of consecutive revenue growth, with over 90% of revenues being cash-based.
 

 Figure 3: Quarterly revenues growing significantly led by ophthalmology sales (source: corporate presentation Ophthalmology Opportunity The company has an impressive ophthalmology development pipeline, with the impact of already commercialized products such as LessDrops combination drops clearly visible in financial results. 

 Figure 4: Impressive ophthalmology pipeline with several launches in 2017 (source: corporate presentation) The success of LessDrops can be seen in lower volumes of sales in market leaders, such as Alcon's Vigamox and Allergan's Pred Forte. LessDrops are the perfect example of how the company's treatments benefit our healthcare system, as they cost $80 versus an average of $323 for standard of care eye drops and 50% less drop applications are needed. 

 Figure 5: Eye drop market leaders unit volumes since LessDrops launch (source: corporate presentation) Another opportunity I'd like to touch on is in glaucoma, with the launch of combination eye drops with several benefits over current treatments. These include being preservative-free to reduce stinging and burning sensations, as well as increasing corneal penetration and length of residence on the eye. By offering a lower cost solution with increased convenience for patients, Imprimis CFO Andrew Boll has commented that two-thirds of the company's 1,500 existing ophthalmology customers prescribe glaucoma medication. If half of existing customers give the company their glaucoma business at $50 per month and 300 customers per physician, it equates to a $7.5 million revenue opportunity per month.
 For a company with a market capitalization of around $80 million and close to $20 million in revenue in 2016, that is a big opportunity. Don't forget that management expects significant margin expansion in 2017 due to production efficiency after having made its over $5 million investment in robotics and automation in a new start of the art cGMP facility. Such a facility should result in the company acquiring new client accounts. Hidden Opportunity in 503B Management has previously commented on pursuing a new drug application (NDA) for their product reformulations via the 505(b)(2) pathway. Though not part of the core business model and the company does not have the resources to pursue these opportunities alone, they have developed several unique drug formulations that are either patented or patent pending. CEO Mark Baum has already stated they have entered into confidential discussions with pharmaceutical executives and other experts to monetise these assets. The biggest of these opportunites might be in the company's patent pending formulation of Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Acthar Gel, which sells for around $38,000 today (accounting for 37% of the $4 billion dollar firm's revenue in its most recent quarter). Imprimis' candidate has been in a stability study for over six months. Expenses for the program have been minimal, and if the asset is monetised in the medium term the resulting cash would be much welcome to aid the company's expansion in ophthalmology. As to what a deal would look like, Mark Baum had the following to say which I believe every investor should read twice: It's not going to cost our shareholders much, but I think it is going to potentially drive considerable value as an asset on our balance sheet whether it's an out license program or an asset that we sell or shares in the Company in a spin-off that we own. But it could be of considerable value. Monetisation of other such assets is a possibility this year as well. Actions to Take and Risks For investors interested in this story who have done their due diligence, I suggest buying an initial position in the near term. Also, in the near to medium term in the event of significant volatility or share price weakness, I would add to this position.
 Investors can win in multiple ways, as ophthalmology revenues continue to grow with several product launches throughout the year. Also, in the event of monetizing the company's product reformulations, the balance sheet could stand to benefit considerably and future dilution prove unnecessary or reduced. Risks to the story include execution risk in product launches, significant competition with larger much better capitalized companies fighting to retain market share, and delayed profitability due to focus on growth. Baum has stated achieving profitability in the near term is an area of focus, with most of capital expenditures behind the company. Personally, I infer from the conference call that it could happen by year end 2017 or in the first half of 2018. Cost structure is currently being refined, with cash-based expenditures to decrease by $3 million annually. On March 22nd the company raised $3.1 million in a direct offering. I was encouraged to see that several company officials, including Baum, participated in the offering. I wouldn't be surprised to see another one later in the year, albeit hopefully at a higher share price. Lastly, CEO compensation for Baum appears incredibly excessive to me. Author's note: My goal is to identify undervalued stocks for my readers with favorable risk/reward profiles and catalysts that could propel shares higher. I categorize ideas into near-term, medium-term (months to a year), and long term (multi-year), based on when I expect outperformance to potentially occur.

CHICAGO and SAN DIEGO, June 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a spin-out company of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:   IMMY), today announced it has entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with various accredited investors, to raise gross proceeds of approximately $20 million in a private placement of preferred stock.  The investor syndicate consists of a number of healthcare and other accredited investors, including certain members of the Imprimis and Eton boards of directors.  Eton will use the proceeds of the financing to develop its patent-pending sterile injectable drug candidate pipeline, as well as for general corporate purposes.

Eton Pharmaceuticals was formed by Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as a separately managed and financed entity to develop and commercialize two of Imprimis' patent-pending sterile injectable drug candidates utilizing the FDA 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.  Following the completion of this financing, Imprimis will retain approximately 27 percent equity ownership in Eton and have a royalty interest in the two sterile injectable drug candidates pursuant to asset purchase and license agreements between the two companies.    
"We are happy with the strong investor interest in Eton and pleased to have a high-caliber group of investors participate in Eton's initial equity financing," stated Mark L. Baum, Eton Board member and CEO of Imprimis.  "We believe this investment represents a strong vote of confidence in Eton's innovative product pipeline and its potential opportunity in two significant U.S. drug markets totaling well over $2 billion annually.  Our strategy of commercializing these drug candidates through Eton is to allow Imprimis to continue growing its core business while creating additional value for our stockholders by ensuring our drug formulation assets are put to their highest and best use.  The Eton transaction may serve as a model in the future for other 505(b)(2) candidates within Imprimis' library of proprietary compounded drug formulations." 
In conjunction with the financing, Charles Casamento, a former CEO of Questcor, Inc. and current executive director and principal of the Sage Group, has joined the Board of Directors of Eton.  During his career, Mr. Casamento has been CEO of four life science companies and has served as a director on the boards of eleven companies.
"We are delighted to welcome Chuck to Eton's Board of Directors. His leadership and significant accomplishments over the last four decades in the healthcare sector, including his prior experience with H.P. Acthar® Gel, will bring valuable insights to Eton as we embark on an opportunity to develop important drugs and compete in large markets where there currently is only one FDA-approved option for patients," added Mr. Baum.
Mr. Casamento stated, "I am very pleased to be joining Eton's Board of Directors and look forward to working with the leadership team to realize the company's vision of bringing its proprietary corticotropin and other innovative sterile injectable product candidates to market." 
National Securities Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of National Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:   NHLD), acted as the exclusive placement agent for the financing.  The Liquid Venture Partners group at National Securities Corporation was responsible for sourcing and executing the financing.

SAN DIEGO, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:   IMMY), an ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical company, today announced its core patent-pending ophthalmic formulations have now served more than one million patient eyes.  Imprimis first began offering ophthalmic solutions to physicians three years ago with the launch of its GoDropless® campaign for cataract surgery.  By eliminating or reducing the need for post-surgery eye drop regimens, Dropless® injectable formulations, which have now been dispensed more than 500,000 times, have potentially saved Medicare, state governments and patients over 100 million dollars.  Additionally, Imprimis' affordably priced LessDrops® combination topical drops serve patients following cataract, refractive and other ocular procedures.  Dropless® and LessDrops® formulations, made in Imprimis' 503B FDA-registered and inspected outsourcing facility, adhere to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and are available for purchase by physicians, hospitals and surgery centers without the need for a patient-specific prescription.  










 







							 		LessDrops
							  



 

 
 



Imprimis has invested millions of dollars into quality systems and processes to protect the patient, including its innovative new packaging solutions.  LessDrops® formulations will now be shipped in a new color-coded label and bottle system designed to ensure proper performance, delivering approximately 90 drops from each bottle.  LessDrops® formulations, new bottle, and labeling system are available from the company's 503B FDA-registered outsourcing facility that participates in the FDA's MedWatch adverse event reporting system.  
Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis, stated, "We are honored to have gained the trust of thousands of eye care professionals and their patients since we started these programs just over three years ago.  Imprimis is committed to providing high quality, innovative formulations at affordable prices, and adhering to this principle has undoubtedly helped us reach this important milestone.  Our innovative solutions, which all have come from the clinical experience of our physician-customers, have eliminated or reduced post-surgery drop regimens, provided better medication adherence and recovery, in addition to saving customers money compared to the standard of care."  
Baum continued, "It is gratifying to hear the peace of mind our customers have when we describe the investments we've made to ensure the quality of our products.  From equipment to training to providing educational tools on what to look out for when choosing a trusted pharmaceutical partner, physicians and their support staff are excited about how well our solutions function, how affordably they are priced and the excellent customer service we offer.  By collapsing the value chain for our customers, eliminating having to deal with insurance companies, benefit managers, and pharmacies that switch their prescriptions, Imprimis is putting power back in the prescriber's prescription pad." 
About Dropless® Ophthalmic Surgery Formulations
Imprimis' proprietary ophthalmic formulations use patent-pending technologies to uniquely allow for the combination of drugs such as triamcinolone and moxifloxacin that do not typically distribute evenly in a suspension. Two compounded antibiotic and steroid formulations currently available in single, injectable, intraocular doses administered during ocular surgery include preservative-free combinations of triamcinolone acetonide and moxifloxacin hydrochloride and triamcinolone acetonide, moxifloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin. The relative strengths of the active ingredients can be tailored to individual patients. Intraoperative administration of drugs has been shown to reduce both non-compliance and patient error, significantly lessening the surgeon's concern and elevating the patient's experience with cataract surgery. 1-2 Physicians have prescribed Imprimis' proprietary formulations for use in thousands of cataract surgeries, and have reported advantages including reduction of compliance concerns and reduction of staff and chair time spent on instructions and follow-up with post-operative surgical patients and pharmacists.1-2 For more information, please visit www.DropLess.com
About Imprimis' LessDrops® Combination Drops
Imprimis' portfolio of combination drop therapy topical formulations may require up to 50% fewer drops to be administered by patients and may provide significant cost savings of up to 75% compared to current traditional post-surgery eye drop treatments. The LessDrops® educational campaign aims to improve patient compliance and alleviate patient confusion associated with complex eye drop regimens.

We offer thousands of formulations typically prescribed by urologists for those patients in need.

It is estimated that as many as 10 million men and women in the US alone suffer from interstitial cystitis (IC).1,2 
Finding treatment options for your patients can be a challenge.  According to the American Urological Association (AUA), there is only one FDA approved treatment option readily available. The AUA guidelines have also identified bladder instillations, a second-line treatment, as an immediate treatment because it is delivered directly to the bladder. Many of these are compounded formulations prescribed by physicians. Learn more about Defeat IC.


There are more than 600,000 new cases of erectile dysfunction of men ages 40-69 in the United States expected annually.3 The American Urological Association treatment guidelines indicate that intracavernous injections including Bimix and Trimix are the most effective non-surgical treatment for erectile dysfunction.3 View the erectile dysfunction AUA guidelines.
ED free focuses on spreading awareness of erectile dysfunction to patients and providing them access to the right treatments for ED. For more information about ED free, click here.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Autoimmunity
Providing your patients high quality customized medications.







The body depends on the immune system’s defense mechanism to defend against infections and other diseases. The immune system is made up of antibodies which include organs, cells and proteins that attack foreign substances entering the body. When this same mechanism malfunctions and begins to attack its own cells, damaging tissues, it is known as an autoimmune disorder.
At ImprimisRx, we offer customized formulations that may be prescribed by physicians for many autoimmune disorders.
Conditions may include:

Autoimmune thyroid
Chronic fatigue
