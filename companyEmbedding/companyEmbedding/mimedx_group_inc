The PURION® Process

 
Human amniotic membrane allografts have been used for a variety of reconstructive surgical procedures since the early 1900s. The use of the amniotic membrane as an allograft has accelerated due to the development of the PURION® Process, which among other things allows the tissue to be dehydrated and sterilized.
The proprietary PURION® Process safely and gently separates placental tissues, cleans and reassembles layers, and then dehydrates the tissue to preserve the key elements associated with healing. The PURION® Process removes blood components while protecting the delicate scaffold of the amniotic membrane, leaving an intact extracellular matrix. The result is a durable graft with natural barrier properties that offers clinicians a clear advantage in soft tissue applications. PURION® processed dehydrated human amnion/chorion allografts can be stored at ambient conditions for up to five years.
The proprietary process has been specifically designed to deliver a clinically effective and minimally manipulated allograft tissue. All placental tissues are recovered under sterile conditions from patients who have been screened for underlying infectious disease. No chemicals are used in the PURION® Process that might result in chemical cross-linking or decellularization.
For more information, please refer to package insert.

Amniotic Membrane Description

 
Human amniotic membrane is comprised of the innermost layer of the placenta and lines the amniotic cavity. The membrane is composed of multiple layers including a single layer of epithelial cells, a basement membrane and an avascular connective tissue matrix. The tissues of the placenta present a very complex interrelationship of materials that possess numerous physiologic characteristics, that can in turn change in importance with the appropriate stage of gestation.  During pregnancy, the placenta permits the passage of nutrients, metabolites and metabolic gases, and provides physical and immunological protection to the developing fetus.  In addition, it produces a variety of steroids and important metabolic hormones.8
Amniotic membrane is a unique material and its composition contains collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VII.  Amniotic membrane is composed of structural extracellular matrix (ECM), that also contains specialized proteins fibronectin, laminins, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, amniotic membrane contains essential, active, healing growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF).8 Amniotic tissues have shown little to no HLA-A, B, C antigens and β2 microglobulin.3

CollaFixTM Product Overview



CollaFix™ BioBraid – Gapped Achilles Tendon Sheep Study Video
Collagen is the material that binds cells together, holds organs in place, gives tissues their mechanical properties, connects muscles to bone (tendons), and holds joints together (ligaments); it is the framework of the body upon which tissues are built. Tendons and ligaments are composed predominantly of collagen.
The CollaFix™ technology was developed to mimic the natural composition, structure and mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues in order to augment their repair. Our materials are designed to function as a temporary mechanical support to allow early rehabilitation after surgical repair, which is crucial for optimal repair of tendons and ligaments. It acts as a scaffold for the emerging repair cells to generate a new tissue. CollaFix™ is also biodegradable and disappears during the repair process and after the repair is complete.
The core of the CollaFix™ technology is based on collagen fibers that are the size of a human hair and are fabricated in continuous lengths of spooled collagen fibers. These fibers are cross-linked with a cross-linking agent that not only makes them incredibly strong, but also makes them biocompatible, functionally long-lived after implantation, and resorbable, with the added advantage that products resulting from the natural degradation process are also biocompatible.
The strength of the CollaFix™ fibers allows the use of standard textile manufacturing equipment to construct CollaFix™ devices. This means that the fibers can be assembled into a variety of configurations and geometries, which can be designed to mimic the natural collagen architecture in tissues. Another advantage of the fiber technology is that it is entirely scalable with respect to size and strength, so the properties can be adapted to target the specific properties of the tissue being repaired.
The CollaFix™ fibers mimic the mechanical properties, particularly strength and stiffness, of natural tendon fibers.  When assembled into braids, the fiber system provides a scaffold for regenerative cells to invade and colonize.  Mechanical loads then induce the reparative cells to regenerate normal tendon tissue.  The braids are as strong as human tendons and thereby allow the repaired tendon to be loaded by exercise immediately after surgery.  These loads stimulate the reparative cells to differentiate into tendon cells and to regenerate normal tendon tissue, instead of scar and a weak repair.
This technology is not yet available for sale.

MiMedx Strategic Plan: Evolution Into a Biopharmaceutical Company
 
 

 


 
MiMedx® delivers innovative bioactive healing products for tissue regeneration


MiMedx® is the global premier processor, marketer, and distributor of human amniotic tissue. MiMedx® has distributed over 900,000 amniotic tissue grafts worldwide and achieved profound clinical outcomes in multiple therapeutic areas including ophthalmology, spine, chronic wounds, dental, orthopedic surgery, sports medicine, and urology.  With this groundbreaking human tissue offering that promotes bioactive healing, MiMedx® believes its unmatched knowledge and superior processing of amniotic tissue strategically positions the Company to become the leader in regenerative medicine.

 
PURION®  Process is the Foundation of MiMedx® Products
The Company’s patent protected PURION® Process is the foundation of the MiMedx® AmnioFix® and EpiFix® products that serve to regenerate damaged or diseased tissues by delivering human extracellular matrix components, essential growth factors, and specialized mediating cytokines. AmnioFix® and EpiFix® modulate inflammation, reduce scar tissue formation, and enhance healing.  The Company’s proprietary PURION® Process dry preserves human amniotic membrane tissue, resulting in minimally manipulated tissue products that address numerous serious unmet medical needs requiring tissue regeneration or healing inside and outside the body. Through the Company’s unique process for dehydrating human amniotic tissues, improved clinical outcomes, increased patient quality of life, and reduced financial burden to the healthcare system are achieved. 




MiMedx® obtains human amniotic membrane tissue that would otherwise be discarded through its placenta donation program.  The “Give the Gift of Healing” placenta donation program allows mothers, delivering healthy babies by planned Caesarean section, to donate their placentas to MiMedx® which would otherwise be discarded by the hospital as medical waste. The MiMedx® staff and all of our resources are dedicated to handling, processing, and delivering the donated tissues to patients. The PURION® processed tissues are safe, effective, and minimally manipulated allografts that are intended for homologous use.  
The MiMedx® allografts produced from the Company’s proprietary PURION® Process for amniotic membrane tissue can be stored at room temperature for five years without the need for refrigeration or freezing. The grafts can be utilized right out of the package without a complicated thawing process. These critical qualities of the MiMedx® allografts allow hospitals, clinics, and surgeons to immediately provide the appropriate treatment while effectively manage their inventory of allografts. 
MiMedx® is dedicated to the development and support of thoughtful and effective philanthropic programs to help those in underserved medical areas in need of healing.

The PURION® Process

 
Human amniotic membrane allografts have been used for a variety of reconstructive surgical procedures since the early 1900s. The use of the amniotic membrane as an allograft has accelerated due to the development of the PURION® Process, which among other things allows the tissue to be dehydrated and sterilized.
The proprietary PURION® Process safely and gently separates placental tissues, cleans and reassembles layers, and then dehydrates the tissue to preserve the key elements associated with healing. The PURION® Process removes blood components while protecting the delicate scaffold of the amniotic membrane, leaving an intact extracellular matrix. The result is a durable graft with natural barrier properties that offers clinicians a clear advantage in soft tissue applications. PURION® processed dehydrated human amnion/chorion allografts can be stored at ambient conditions for up to five years.
The proprietary process has been specifically designed to deliver a clinically effective and minimally manipulated allograft tissue. All placental tissues are recovered under sterile conditions from patients who have been screened for underlying infectious disease. No chemicals are used in the PURION® Process that might result in chemical cross-linking or decellularization.
For more information, please refer to package insert.

Amniotic Membrane Description

 
Human amniotic membrane is comprised of the innermost layer of the placenta and lines the amniotic cavity. The membrane is composed of multiple layers including a single layer of epithelial cells, a basement membrane and an avascular connective tissue matrix. The tissues of the placenta present a very complex interrelationship of materials that possess numerous physiologic characteristics, that can in turn change in importance with the appropriate stage of gestation.  During pregnancy, the placenta permits the passage of nutrients, metabolites and metabolic gases, and provides physical and immunological protection to the developing fetus.  In addition, it produces a variety of steroids and important metabolic hormones.8
Amniotic membrane is a unique material and its composition contains collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VII.  Amniotic membrane is composed of structural extracellular matrix (ECM), that also contains specialized proteins fibronectin, laminins, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, amniotic membrane contains essential, active, healing growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF).8 Amniotic tissues have shown little to no HLA-A, B, C antigens and β2 microglobulin.3

CollaFixTM Product Overview



CollaFix™ BioBraid – Gapped Achilles Tendon Sheep Study Video
Collagen is the material that binds cells together, holds organs in place, gives tissues their mechanical properties, connects muscles to bone (tendons), and holds joints together (ligaments); it is the framework of the body upon which tissues are built. Tendons and ligaments are composed predominantly of collagen.
The CollaFix™ technology was developed to mimic the natural composition, structure and mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues in order to augment their repair. Our materials are designed to function as a temporary mechanical support to allow early rehabilitation after surgical repair, which is crucial for optimal repair of tendons and ligaments. It acts as a scaffold for the emerging repair cells to generate a new tissue. CollaFix™ is also biodegradable and disappears during the repair process and after the repair is complete.
The core of the CollaFix™ technology is based on collagen fibers that are the size of a human hair and are fabricated in continuous lengths of spooled collagen fibers. These fibers are cross-linked with a cross-linking agent that not only makes them incredibly strong, but also makes them biocompatible, functionally long-lived after implantation, and resorbable, with the added advantage that products resulting from the natural degradation process are also biocompatible.
The strength of the CollaFix™ fibers allows the use of standard textile manufacturing equipment to construct CollaFix™ devices. This means that the fibers can be assembled into a variety of configurations and geometries, which can be designed to mimic the natural collagen architecture in tissues. Another advantage of the fiber technology is that it is entirely scalable with respect to size and strength, so the properties can be adapted to target the specific properties of the tissue being repaired.
The CollaFix™ fibers mimic the mechanical properties, particularly strength and stiffness, of natural tendon fibers.  When assembled into braids, the fiber system provides a scaffold for regenerative cells to invade and colonize.  Mechanical loads then induce the reparative cells to regenerate normal tendon tissue.  The braids are as strong as human tendons and thereby allow the repaired tendon to be loaded by exercise immediately after surgery.  These loads stimulate the reparative cells to differentiate into tendon cells and to regenerate normal tendon tissue, instead of scar and a weak repair.
This technology is not yet available for sale.

Reduce Cost to Closure and Minimize Graft Wastage with EpiFix®


DID YOU KNOW?77% of DFUs and 67% of VLUs have an area of less than or equal to 5 sq cm1
EpiFix® dehydrated Human Amnion/Chorion Membrane allograft provides a scaffold and growth factors for cellular ingrowth, and it reduces inflammation and scar tissue formation for enhanced healing. With a variety of sizes available, EpiFix® minimizes graft waste and overall treatment costs to heal wounds. To that end, MiMedx Supports the CMS 2014 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Proposed Rule for Skin Substitutes.
Click here to read a white paper on the proposed CMS reimbursement changes, the impact on chronic wound care and new skin substitute product options to help reduce wastage.
While MiMedx is supportive of CMS and its goal to minimize cost and waste in the skin substitute category for hospital outpatient services, the Company has proposed an alternative 4-tiered system for payment based on wound size/complications.
Additional CMS wastage data2:

$94 million of the $101 million CMS paid was used for only Apligraf® and Dermagraft®

With multiple size appropriate grafts, EpiFix® represents cost savings in the treatment of acute and chronic wounds.

MiMedx® History


Sales Team Attends One of the Company’s Education and Development Sessions

MiMedx Group, Inc. was incorporated on February 28, 2008. Its initial assets consisted of our HydroFix® and CollaFixTM technology platforms.
On January 5, 2011, the company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Surgical Biologics, LLC, and subsequently consolidated the corporate offices and operating facilities in Kennesaw, Georgia. This strategic acquisition brought together amnion tissue processing technology with MiMedx's experienced management team and extensive distribution network in order to position the company for market opportunities across multiple areas of medicine. After nearly two decades of human tissue experience, the Surgical Biologics founders had the vision to apply modern proprietary processing techniques to placental tissue to create unique ophthalmic, spinal, orthopedic, and dental implants.
At the time of the acquisition, Surgical Biologics distributed tissue in several different membrane sub-segments, such as ocular, dental, and spine. Early 2011, MiMedx launched AmnioFix® for applications in spinal procedures. AmnioFix® is used as a barrier membrane that reduces scar tissue formation between the dura and soft tissue. During 2011, the company launched EpiFix® nationwide. EpiFix® is an allograft specifically processed for acute and chronic wounds. The company further expanded its amnion product offering in 2011 with the introduction of AmnioFix® Wrap for both nerve and tendon protection applications. 
On January 13th, 2016, MiMedx® completed the acquisition of Stability Biologics, a provider of human tissue products to surgeons, facilities and distributors serving the surgical, spine and orthopedics sectors of the healthcare industry. Stability Biologics, which operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of MiMedx®, has developed an innovative proprietary platform in bioactive bone graft products and tissue allografts including structural/particulate bone, tendons/ligaments, structural allografts, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and skin products for burns and traumatic wound care.

Management
MiMedx® has built a management team with highly experienced healthcare executives with track records of leading large healthcare organizations in generating growth, producing profitability, and increasing shareholder value. Our management team draws on guidance from an insightful board of directors and medical advisory board. Collectively, they are committed to achieving success, accomplishing our corporate goals and growing the company. The management team at MiMedx® includes:-

 
  

 


 Parker H. "Pete" Petit | Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 
 

Mr. Petit joined MiMedx Group in February 2009 as the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. A visionary healthcare executive, Mr. Petit has a history of developing companies from their emerging stages and leading them to maturity and significant stature in their respective markets. 
In 1970, Mr. Petit founded Healthdyne, an international healthcare company that manufactured high technology healthcare devices, provided healthcare information systems and technology, and provided healthcare services and disease management. The Healthdyne related companies grew to annual revenues in excess of $1 billion.  In order to increase shareholder values, Healthdyne was split into several publicly traded companies through public offerings and spinouts to shareholders.  Subsequently, the home infusion therapy subsidiary was sold to W. R. Grace Corporation.  In 1995, Healthdyne Maternity Management was merged with Tokos Medical to form Matria Healthcare.  At that point, Mr. Petit relinquished the CEO role and remained Chairman of the Board of all the companies.  In 1997, Healthdyne Technologies was merged with Respironics. Mr. Petit resumed the duties of President and CEO of Matria Healthcare in 2000.  In 2001, Healthcare.com, which was formerly Healthdyne Information Enterprises, merged with XCare.net Corporation to form Quovadx. Through Mr. Petit’s vision and leadership, Matria Healthcare transitioned into the industry’s only fully integrated health, productivity and disease management care continuum providing employer and health plan clients access to wellness programs, nurse triage services, decision support programs, disease management programs for chronic diseases, case management programs for acute and catastrophic conditions and unparalleled health data integration and informatics. Matria Healthcare was sold to Inverness Medical Innovations in May of 2008 in a transaction valued at over $1.2 billion.  
Mr. Petit served on the Board of Directors of Atlantic Southeast Airlines for 16 years until it was acquired by Delta Airlines, and Norrell Corporation, which was acquired by Spherion Corporation.  He currently serves on the Board of Trustees of the National Health Museum and is a member of the Board of Directors of Intelligent Systems Corporation. Mr. Petit currently serves as President of The Petit Group, an Investment Management Organization. Mr. Petit is a member of the Board of Directors of the Georgia Research Alliance, which is chartered by the state of Georgia to promote high technology and scientific development in the state, and he is a 1994 inductee into the Technology Hall of Fame of Georgia.  
Mr. Petit funded a professorial chair for “Engineering in Medicine” at Georgia Tech in 1986.  In 1995, he endowed the Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences at Georgia Tech.  In 2001, he helped fund the biotechnology building at Georgia Tech which has his name, and in 2004, the Science Center building at Georgia State University which also has his name.  
In 2007, he was inducted into the Georgia State Business School Hall of Fame.  In October of 2011, Mr. Petit was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering. Mr. Petit received his bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and Master of Science degree in Engineering Mechanics from Georgia Tech.  He received his MBA degree in Finance from Georgia State University in 1973.

Matria acquired Facet in 1999, and under Mr. Taylor’s leadership, Facet grew to be the global leader in microsampling devices with over a 50% market share and in excess of $85 million in revenue.  
During his 14 year career at Facet, he held various management positions, beginning with the Company’s head of R&D, QA & Regulatory Affairs and progressing through general management and ultimately, Chief Executive Officer. 
With Mr. Taylor as President and COO, MiMedx has put together an infrastructure that is more than capable of generating and serving the prolific demand for its products. Through Mr. Taylor’s operating expertise and the Company’s acquisition of exceptional talent, Mr. Taylor has positioned MiMedx in the critical areas of medical affairs, scientific research, product development, sales & marketing, regulatory affairs, engineering and operations to flawlessly perform through a rapid pace of year-over-year new product development and exponential sales growth.

Healing Gifts

The MiMedx® Placenta Donation Program, Give the Gift of Healing, provides an opportunity for mothers delivering full-term Caesarean section births to donate their placenta (often referred to as “afterbirth”) for medical uses. The placenta is normally discarded as medical waste. However, through donation, the family can provide a priceless gift of healing to those in need. This generous gift creates a personal legacy for the family and newborn knowing that they are helping individuals who require treatment for their difficult-to-heal wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and burns, or soft tissue injuries, and even those undergoing spine, eye and oral surgeries.
MiMedx® is honored to be entrusted with the precious gifts donated to us by the mothers participating in Give the Gift of Healing.  The placenta and its amnion/chorion membranes are rich in many elements that can be vital to healing numerous medical conditions.  MiMedx® has developed the special PURION® Process technology that preserves the properties that are crucial to the healing process, and through our technology, we produce allografts with remarkable healing capabilities. The allografts derived from the placentas entrusted to our care, have helped patients in countless medical applications in the wound care, surgical, sports medicine, ophthalmic and dental sectors of healthcare.
In recognition of the placental donations we are privileged to receive, we have formed our philanthropic mission and developed The MiMedx® Healing Gifts Program. Through Healing Gifts, MiMedx® engages in noteworthy philanthropic endeavors ranging from eye surgeries in Guatemala to programs treating disadvantaged patients across the United States. We are proud of the impact Healing Gifts has made for many patients.
MiMedx® is committed to expanding the reach of Healing Gifts to thousands upon thousands of less fortunate patients. Our goal is to make our PURION® processed tissues available to serve the medical needs of the widest possible group of patients who can benefit from the healing generated by the tissues we process. To this end, the Company continues to actively pursue partnerships with philanthropic and non-profit programs. We pledge to be generous in our sharing of our resources and talents to serve the unmet needs of underserved patients.
We look forward to developing future Healing Gifts partnerships with the desire to affect different patient populations through monetary, product, and/or human resource based contributions.
 

"This video is one example of the impact that we are proud to be a part of. This program, Guatemala: A mission to restore sight, sponsored by IOP Ophthalmics provides vision restoring surgeries to the needy in Guatemala. The MiMedx® PURION® processed tissue is a preferred tissue because of its anti-inflammatory and scar reduction properties while enhancing the healing of the soft tissue."

Acute and Chronic Wounds
Sports Medicine
Surgical Applications







Acute and Chronic Wounds

Our products help patients overcome acute and chronic wounds.
Physicians encounter a variety of wound types on a daily basis, including acute wounds caused by surgical intervention, trauma and burns, as well as chronic wounds that are delayed in closing compared to healing in an otherwise healthy individual. Chronic wounds include diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and arterial ulcers. 
The physician’s goal when treating traumatic wounds is to heal the wound while allowing the patient to retain natural function in the area of the wound with minimal scarring and infection. If a wound becomes infected, it can lead to a loss of limb or life, and physicians want to close the wound as quickly as possible to minimize this risk. Patients with chronic wounds likely have comorbidities that complicate or delay the healing cascade.  
The healing cascade is as follows:Injury: Inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling    
 
Normal soft tissue injuries heal in three main phases         Chronic injuries stall in the inflammatory phase
              
 
 

 
 








Sports Medicine


Sports Medicine is a broad description of the repair and reconstruction of various soft-tissue injuries in or around joints caused by traumas, or chronic conditions brought about by repeated motion in active individuals and athletes. Sports medicine may include various anatomical locations, mainly knee, shoulder and elbow, but this can be broadened to include foot and ankle injuries (such as Achilles tendon rupture) and even hand and wrist injuries. The main types of injuries include tendinopathies, tendinitis, tendinosis, tendon and ligament sprains, and ruptures.


 
 








Surgical Applications

The AmnioFix® technology is being used as a graft for surgical applications to provide a barrier to reduce the amount of scar tissue formation, provide a local anti-inflammatory and help with the soft tissue healing of the area.

 A center of excellence for research and development in regenerative medicine 
 









From our founding, MiMedx® has been a research-focused organization, one that has been able to successfully translate brilliant laboratory insights into real world clinical successes that improve patients’ lives.
Our scientific knowledge of human amniotic tissue based products is unparalleled with our patented PURION® Process focused on enhancing the healing process to improve clinical outcomes. MiMedx's strong commitment to research and development is driving our continued success. 
 



PURION Processed Stem Cell MagnetTM
MIMEDX dHACM ACTS AS A STEM CELL MAGNET TO PROMOTE CELL RECRUITMENT 
In addition to promoting cell proliferation, PURION Processed dHACM was shown to recruit migration of adult stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells, adipose derived stem cells, and hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro assays, MSCs migrated across porous membranes toward pieces of dHACM tissue,1 and MSCs and ADSCs migrated to accelerate closure of cell-free zones in the presence of soluble dHACM extracts, comparable to closure of acellular wounds.2 To confirm these observations in vivo, two murine ischemic skin wound models of stem cell migration were also used. Following subcutaneous implantation, greater numbers of bone marrow MSCs and HSCs were measured at the site of dHACM implantation in wild type mice.1,3 Additionally, using a GFP parabiosis model, GFP+ bone marrow stem cells were identified at sites of neovascularization within the implanted dHACM grafts, indicating that stem cells were recruited from the bone marrow stem cell niche toward the dHACM grafts through the blood circulation.3 When compared to control graft tissue composed of acellular fetal dermal matrix (ADM, PriMatrix, TEI Biosciences), PURION Processed dHACM stimulated recruit greater levels of stem cell recruitment than the ADM tissue.

MiMedx Group, Inc.: A Fundamentally Solid Biomaterials Company Poised For Growth - MiMedx Group Inc. (NASDAQ:MDXG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»MiMedx Group, Inc.: A Fundamentally Solid Biomaterials Company Poised For GrowthDec. 9.16 | About: MiMedx Group (MDXG) Robert Lowy Analyst, healthcare, biotech, long/short equitySummaryBiomaterials company currently undervalued by 30-40%.New products, growth of Sports, Spine, and Orthopedics ("SSO") segment, and the resolution of FDA and patent rulings will be the catalysts.Fundamentally strong company with history of consistent and strong revenue and earnings growth.Note: This analysis was originally prepared September 10, 2016.

 Company: MiMedx Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDXG) Target Price: $10.94 Recommendation I recommend buying a long position in MiMedx Group, Inc., trading at $8.29 per share at the time this analysis was conducted, as I believe the market is undervaluing this security by 30-40%. It is my belief that the current price reflects market's reaction to decreased revenue projections beginning in mid-2015 and a Q1 2016 EPS miss of $0.01 following issues with a new inventory system and slower-than-expected production ramp up of its recently acquired subsidiary, Stability Biologics, LLC. It is my assessment that these represent short-term supply chain disruptions in the face of an increasing product demand. Additionally, the price is being depressed in the face of a Q2 earnings beat due to downwardly revised expectations for 2016 to reflect the aforementioned issues. The catalysts for the appreciation of per share value to an estimated target of $10-12 per share over the short to intermediate term include the following:  Growth of the Spine, Sports Medicine, and Orthopedics segment and continued focus on sales force growth. Planned release of the AmnioFill product line later this month, as well as the future release of the CollaFix product line already under development. Resolution of currently pending patent-protection litigation expected to be ruled entirely, or at least largely, in favor of MiMedx. 
 The risks involved with this investment in addition to overall market sentiment and volatility include the following:  FDA Judgments and Requirements: Currently, two of the company's micronized products, EpiFix Powder and the AmnioFix Injectable, are being reviewed by the FDA to determine continuing status as a Section 361 (not requiring significant clinical trials and approvals) or to require MiMedx to obtain a Biologics License Application (BLA) approval to market these products. Additionally, the regulatory status of its future CollaFix product line is uncertain as to whether it will require Pre-Market Approval or obtain a waiver under section 510(NYSE:K). Legal Proceedings: MiMedx is currently involved in a litigation against competitors for the purposes of patent protection relating to its core tissue processing and clinical products. To date, proceedings have appeared to favor MiMedx. However, the final outcome and its effect on product lines, revenue, and share price remain uncertain. Product Line Risks: The company may fail to bring new products to market in a timely fashion or at all, namely its CollaFix product line, which is susceptible to both FDA regulatory requirements and approval as well as the albeit unlikely event of the termination of its current licensing agreement for this product with Shriners Hospitals - University of South Florida. Reimbursement and the Affordable Care Act (ACA): In 2015, 26% of all sales were to government accounts. While this trend is expected to continue or increase, changes to the reimbursement structures within the ACA, or modifications to the law itself would affect company revenues. Additionally, while private insurance reimbursement agreements for the company's products have grown over recent years, a decrease or failure to obtain additional coverage for its current or future products by private insurers could result in diminished market penetration and revenue.  Company Overview MiMedx is a U.S. based integrated developer, producer, and marketer of implantable tissue products developed from human placental and umbilical cord tissues as well as amniotic fluid to the domestic market. Its products focus on wound care and spine, sports medicine, and orthopedics. FY 2015 revenue was $187.3 million with wound care contributing roughly $141 million (~75%) and SSO contributing $46 million (~25%) to earnings. Annual revenue growth last year was 58% and basic EPS increased from $0.06 in 2014 to $0.28 in 2015. These trends in earnings growth are expected to continue although slow to more sustainable rates of change with time as the company progresses from the early growth stage. At the current price of $8.29, its stock currently trades at roughly 30x P/E. The company has grown via acquisition of Surgical Biologics, LLC in 2011 and most recently, the purchase of Stability Biologics, LLC in January 2016. The purchase of Stability was accomplished for a $10 million valuation, with $6 million in cash, $4 million in company stock, as well as the assumption of $800,000 in debt.
 MiMedx Group, Inc. Core Product Lines:  Wound Care  EpiFix (EpiFix Micronized Powder) AmnioFix (AmnioFix Micronized Injectable) AmnioFill   Spine, Sports Medicine, and Orthopedics  OrthoFlo Physio (Stability Biologics Product) CollaFix - Future Planned Product    Principal Competitors Organogenesis Inc.: A private company with limited available information about revenues, growth, or profitability. Its key competing product lines are Dermagraft and Apligraf. Regarding comparability of these products to the EpiFix and AmnioFix products from MiMedx, a recent study showed statistically significant enhanced healing rates (95% EpiFix vs. 45% Apligraf at six weeks post procedure) as well as greater cost savings in the use of EpiFix per graft due to the offering of different sized grafts which better approximate the surface area of the wound. Osiris Therapeutics (OSIR): A public company with a market capitalization of $155.96 million and currently trading at a price of $5.93 per share. Its revenues in 2014 (2015 statements not yet available) were $59.87 million across three product lines (Grafix, Cartiform and Bio4) compared to $118.2 million in sales for MiMedx in the comparable year. Its principal competitive product to EpiFix is named Grafix. Of note, the company is under current investigation by the SEC and facing a class action lawsuit for allegedly providing false information on the status of product development to shareholders. Additionally, MiMedx filed a lawsuit against Osiris in May 2016 for allegedly falsifying clinical data comparing its Grafix product to EpiFix. Smith & Nephew (SNN): A large public company with a diversified corporate structure with a market capitalization of $14.07 billion, currently trading at $33.07 per share. Its principal competitive product to EpiFix is Oasis. Smith & Nephew reported operating profit for wound care products of $123 million in 2014 (2015 data not yet available) compared to $7.1 million operating profit for MiMedx in the comparable year.
 Investment Thesis As of the writing of this analysis, the market has priced MiMedx Group, Inc. at $8.29. It is my opinion that this represents an overly bearish view of the company based on a downward revision of earnings in mid-2015 as well as a recent earnings miss in Q1 2016 of $0.01 per share taken in the context of broader market uncertainty. Additional factors that I believe the market has priced into this valuation are the risk to market share associated with ongoing patent protection litigation as well as the potential for the FDA to rule that MiMedx must complete the time-consuming and costly process of obtaining approval of a Biologics License Application for its micronized EpiFix powder and AmnioFix injectable products. I believe that this valuation is flawed for the following reasons: The revenue revision and earnings miss were caused by what are very likely transient and short-term events:  The implementation of a new sales management system, which caused a logistical error resulting in the miscounting of inventory (and thus sales) for a period of time, which has subsequently been corrected. Additionally, all sales staff are now required to be trained on the new system to avoid similar issues in the future. While the company expects slower-than-expected production at the newly acquired Stability Biologics plant to continue to be a relative drag on revenue, it fully expects incremental quarterly improvement until all inefficiencies can be fully addressed and manufacturing streamlined. Delays in gaining approval of some of the newly acquired products by the Value Analysis Committees at some hospitals. While the process is taking longer than expected, the feedback received regarding the effectiveness of the product makes approval likely in the short term.  FDA review of the micronized product lines.  In September 2016, a public hearing will be held regarding the micronized products and whether a BLA is required, after which the FDA will make a final determination. While the company is optimistic to shorten any lag in the marketing of these products should they require approval, the company is proceeding with the necessary steps to garner BLA approval. These product lines reflect approximately 12% of FY2015 revenue, which would decrease the estimated value per share to approximately $9.95 (9% decrease from estimated target price), ceteris paribus. While a negative ruling by the FDA would certainly impact company earnings over the short term horizon, the concurrent growth of the SSO portion of the business as well as projected continued revenue growth of the remaining wound care segment would mitigate this effect. 
 New product lines to be introduced  In a press release dated September 1, 2016, the company announced the nationwide release of the AmnioFill product line, the first released by the company in the placental collagen matrix product line, as an addition to its wound care offerings. The CollaFix pipeline, when released, will likely provide a sizable gain to revenue in the SSO portion of the company. Current questions surrounding the timing of this release include whether it will require Pre-Market Approval or receive a 510(K) waiver.  Strong dedication to clinical research of products Especially for new products, clinical acceptance hinges on exposure either by experience using the product or reported results in peer-reviewed publications. While currently focused more on the wound care sector and showing superior results for healing of chronic wounds, it is expected that as the company begins to focus on growing its SSO activities, its efforts in publishing in this area will enhance adoption of these products by physicians and enhance sales. Catalysts It is my belief that MiMedx share price will appreciate 30-40% from current values with a conservative target price of $10.94 per share calculated via DCF analysis. Driving this appreciation in value are three principal catalysts. Expected increase in revenue from newly introduced products, as well as the future release of the CollaFix product line already under development.  The release of the AmnioFill product line will provide additional revenue from the wound care segment, increasing the company and shareholder value. The introduction of CollaFix is expected to be a considerable part of the growth in the SSO segment in the future. Once again, it is not possible to quantify numerically but it is likely that demand for such a product in the sports medicine and orthopedic setting will likely be strong given an aging population that is remaining active, increasing relative risk of injuries such as ACL or rotator cuff that are likely to be candidates for use of the CollaFix product. 
 Resolution of currently pending patent-protection litigation, expected to be ruled entirely, or at least largely, in favor of MiMedx. While not easily quantifiable to revenue growth or share price, the favorable resolution of this litigation will solidify MiMedx's market share with these products and act to stem both future infringement and provide a competitive advantage in the area of implantable tissue products derived from placental or amniotic tissues. Additionally, the resolution would bring an end to the uncertainty regarding the company's intellectual property potentially clearing the way for more risk-averse investors to invest. Growth of the Spine, Sports Medicine, and Orthopedics segment and continued focus on sales force growth. With the acquisition of Stability Biologics in January 2016, the company gained access to an established sales network in the SSO areas. This, combined with an increased focus on growing the sales force, will increase market penetration and sales. The company has planned for SSO to grow to match revenue produced by the wound care segment over the next five years, which would be a boon to overall revenue. This would be equivalent to an annualized growth rate of the SSO sector of 51% if the wound care segment grows at the estimated rates per the DCF analysis with an overall CAGR of 31.09% for revenue of that period and an estimated price using the assumptions previously outlined for the DCF of $28.65 per share. 

 Valuation I have valued MiMedx Group, Inc. using a DCF Analysis. The following assumptions were used in this calculation: Revenue Growth Rate: Company revenue growth was 99.8% in 2014 and 58.4% in 2015. Given that these rates are unsustainable, I used a linear regression of the last five annual revenue growth rates to estimate the rate of change at -36.6%. This gave a 2016 estimated growth rate of 37.07% and a 2017 estimated growth rate of 23.52%. For the period 2018-2020, I used the consensus analyst growth rate of 15%. All expense/adjustment values were kept at a constant ratio to revenue based upon current trended levels.
 Long-term (Sustainable) Growth Rate: Calculated estimates of long-term growth rate (ROE*RR) were unrealistic at ~25%. For a more realistic rate in perpetuity, I chose 4% to reflect average long-term GDP growth. WACC:  The company currently has no long-term debt on the books, so for the short term (next five years) I used a capital structure of 100% equity. As it is conceivable that the company would add debt to enhance its overall cost of capital in the future, for the long-term estimate of terminal value, I used a WACC calculated on a target capital structure based on average of peer group with 29% Debt and 71% Equity, with a cost of debt (pre-tax) of 3.29%, based upon industry comparison of the current cost of debt. The cost of equity was calculated via the CAPM using the 10-year arithmetic mean of returns on the Russell 2000 to estimate expected market return (E(Rm)). Risk-free rate (Rfr) is the current yield on the 10-year US Treasury. Beta (ß) of .73 was obtained from Google Finance and found to be consistent with other sources.  

 Investment Risks: The risks involved with this investment in addition to overall market sentiment and volatility include the following: FDA Judgments and Requirements:  FDA could rule following scientific review that the micronized products do not qualify for regulation under Section 361 as minimally processed HCT/Ps, requiring the completion of the Biologics License Application process, which would result in decreased revenue as well as increased expenses/time for approval. FDA could require that the "CollaFix" product line is a Level II or III medical device and/or not grant a 510(K) waiver, requiring the company to undergo the costly and time-consuming process of obtaining a Pre-Market Approval. 
 Legal Proceedings  The court(s) could rule against MiMedx in one of three (3) ongoing patent protection cases initiated by MiMedx. This could potentially result in decreased market share and as a result, decreased revenues. Additionally, these legal actions could continue for longer than expected through multiple rounds of discovery and proceedings, increasing legal expenses.  Product Line Risks The brand may be unable to bring CollaFix to market as a result of:  Failure of FDA approval should it be required to undergo the PMA process. Unexpected termination of licensing agreement with Shriner's Hospital-University of South Florida.   Reimbursement and the Affordable Care Act  In 2015, 26% of all sales were to government accounts. While this trend is expected to continue or increase, changes to the reimbursement structures within the ACA, or modifications to the law itself could affect company revenues. Private insurance reimbursement agreements for the company's products have grown over recent years, with more than 180 private payers reimbursing for the EpiFix product line alone. A decrease or failure to obtain coverage for its current or future products by private insurers would result in diminished or lost revenue, respectively.  Worst-Case Scenario It is possible that all of these estimates are wrong due to the unlikely event of fraudulent or misleading claims or representation of financial statements by the company, macroeconomic factors such as recession, unforeseen events, and inherent error in estimating values for calculations. Therefore, in this section, I present the doomsday scenario where all of the assertions on the performance of the company are incorrect. Assuming a dramatically lower rate of growth in the short and long term as keeping pace with GDP growth, estimated at 2%, the stock would be valued at an estimated price of approximately $4.28 per share. Additionally, in the case of liquidation of the company, the price could be estimated by Net Assets/Shares Outstanding (non-diluted), which would equate to a price at current balance sheet values of $1.02 per share and a value of $0.00 when adjusted for intangible assets.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
