or any other Partner for any act or omission (in relation to the

best interests of the Partnership and within the authority granted

criminal act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that
such Covered Person’s conduct was unlawful. Each Covered
Person shall be entitled to rely in good faith on the advice of
legal counsel to the Partnership, accountants and other experts or

reliance on such advice shall in any event subject such person to

satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines
and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of
investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim),
joint and several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown,
liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, for purposes of this

and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, in which the Covered
Person may be involved, or threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person’s management of
the affairs of the Partnership or which relate to or arise out of
or in connection with the Partnership, its property, its business
or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of any act or omission of such Covered Person
constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered
Person
 
21



shall not be entitled to indemnification under

determination of an arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act
in good faith and in what such Covered Person reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Partnership
and within the authority granted to such Covered Person by this
Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that such Covered Person’s
conduct was unlawful; provided further , that if such
Covered Person is a Partner or a Withdrawn Partner, such Covered
Person shall bear its share of such Losses in accordance with such
Covered Person’s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in the
Partnership as of the time of the actions or omissions that gave
rise to such Losses. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
expenses (including legal fees) incurred by a Covered Person
(including, without limitation, the General Partner) in defending
any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding may, with the
approval of the General Partner, from time to time, be advanced by
the Partnership prior to the final disposition of such claim,
demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership
of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered Person to
repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently
determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized in this Section, and the Partnership and
its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such
Covered Person’s interests/investments in the Partnership and
such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts
otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such
repayment obligation. If a Partner institutes litigation against a
Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation
hereunder, such Partner shall be responsible, up to the amount of
such Partner’s Interests and remaining GP-Related Commitment
and Capital Commitment - Related Commitment, for such
Partner’s pro rata share of the Partnership’s
expenses related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the
General Partner. The Partnership may purchase insurance, to the
extent available at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims,
damages or liabilities covered by the foregoing indemnification
provisions. Partners will not be personally obligated with respect
to indemnification pursuant to this Section.

Section 3.7. 
Representations of Limited Partners .

(a) Each Limited Partner by
execution of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the
terms and conditions hereof as provided herein or in the
Partnership Act) represents and warrants to every other Partner and
to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner,
that such Limited Partner is acquiring each of such Limited
Partner’s Interests for such Limited Partner’s own
account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute
the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any
interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Limited
Partner hereunder. Each Limited Partner represents and warrants
that such Limited Partner understands that the Interests have not
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore such
Interests may not be resold without registration under such Act or
exemption from such registration, and that accordingly such Limited
Partner must bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner
represents that such Limited Partner has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that such Limited
Partner is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Partnership, and that such Limited Partner is
able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited
Partner represents that such Limited Partner’s overall
commitment to the Partnership and other investments which are not
readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Limited
Partner’s net worth and the Limited Partner has no need for
liquidity in the Limited Partner’s investment in Interests.
Each Limited Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of
the Limited Partner, the Limited Partner has been furnished any
materials that such Limited Partner has requested relating to the
Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and has
been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives
of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the
offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment
and to obtain any other additional information relating thereto.
Each Limited Partner represents that the Limited Partner has
consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Limited Partner
with the Limited Partner’s own advisers as to the financial,
tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in
Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the
Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Limited
Partner.
 
22




(b) Each Partner agrees that the
representations and warranties contained in paragraph
(a) above shall be true and correct as of any date that such
Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership
(whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or
otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby
agrees that such capital contribution shall serve as confirmation
thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount
of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such
repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

Representation . Each Limited Partner certifies that

Partner’s Unfunded Commitment and subject to all other terms
and conditions set forth herein and/or in any other agreement
relating thereto; and provided further , that, following an
initial determination of the commitment of a Partner (other than
BREE (Cayman)), such Partner’s Unfunded Commitment shall not

General Partner for the purposes set forth herein or in the

Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners
that are also executive officers of Blackstone) the amount of any
GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner
or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner

required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in
installments, in each case on terms determined by the General
Partner in accordance with Section 5.2.

Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate
GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with

the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall

Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in clause

Categories on a proportionate basis.
For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is
decreased to 12.5%, the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn
Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 17.5% and 20%,
respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any
Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such reduction.

(iii) The Holdback Percentage may
not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the
other Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in
clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the
Retaining Withdrawn Partners’ Holdback Percentage beyond 21%
unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing
Partners’ Holdback Percentage to 21%. The General Partner may
not increase the Deceased Partners’ Holdback Percentage
beyond 24% unless the General Partner increases the Holdback
Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn
Partners to 24%. The General Partner may not increase the Holdback
Percentage of any Partner Category beyond 24% unless such increase
applies equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the
Holdback Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to
distributions relating to Carried Interest made after the date of
such increase. The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General
Partner from proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of
any Partner Category (following a reduction of the Holdback
Percentages below the Initial Holdback Percentages), if the
resulting Holdback Percentages are consistent with the above. For
example, if the General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages
for Existing Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased
Partners to 12.5%, 17.5% and 20%, respectively, the General Partner
shall have the right to subsequently increase the Holdback
Percentages to the Initial Holdback Percentages.

(iv)(A) Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Partnership may increase or
decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner
Category (in such capacity, the “ Subject Partner
”) pursuant to a majority vote of the Special Limited
Partners and BREP GP Delaware (a “ Holdback Vote
”); provided , that a Subject Partner’s Holdback
Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as
such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the Partnership of the
decision to increase such Subject Partner’s Holdback
Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Partner,
been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the
Partnership for consideration before a second Holdback Vote
(requested by the Subject Partner) and (II) decreased unless such
decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote
under this clause (iv); provided further , that such
decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing
Holdback Percentage for such Subject Partner’s Partner
Category; provided further , that a Partner shall not
vote to increase a Subject Partner’s Holdback Percentage
unless such voting partner determines, in his good faith judgment,
that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably
likely that such Subject Partner, or any of his successors or
assigns (including his estate or heirs) who at the time of such
vote holds the Partnership interest or otherwise has the right to
receive distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of
satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become
due.

(B) A Holdback Vote shall take place
at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Special Limited Partners and
BREP GP Delaware shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to
the Holdback Vote regardless of such Partner’s interest in
the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such Partner in
person or by proxy.
 
25




(C) If the result of the second
Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner’s Holdback
Percentage, such Subject Partner may submit the decision to an
arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both
the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if
the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a
mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second
Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner
shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third
arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided
further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a
mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request,
the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association
shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that
submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second
Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate
their reasonably projected out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto
and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator
and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay
the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject
Partner’s and the Partnership’s expenses) into an
escrow account to be controlled by Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett, as escrow agent (or such other comparable law firm as the
Partnership and Subject Partner shall agree). The arbitrator shall
direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all
expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs leading
thereto) and to return to the “victorious” party the
entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If
the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is
insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such
“losing” party shall then provide any additional funds
necessary to cover such costs to such “victorious”
party. For purposes hereof, the “victorious” party
shall be the Partnership, if the Holdback Percentage ultimately
determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined
in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback
Percentage for the Subject Partner’s Partner Category;
otherwise, the Subject Partner shall be the
“victorious” party. The party that is not the
“victorious” party shall be the “losing”
party.

(D) In the event of a decrease in a
Subject Partner’s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a
Holdback Vote under this clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a
decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause
(iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject
Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as
expressly provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as
Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such
Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner’s
reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback
Vote under this clause (iv).

(v)(A) If a Partner’s Holdback
Percentage exceeds 15% (such percentage in excess of 15%
constituting the “ Excess Holdback Percentage
”), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his Holdback
obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such
portion constituting such Partner’s “ Excess
Holdback ”), and such Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner
with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he
was a Partner), to the extent his Excess Holdback obligation has
previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the
Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain
in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner) satisfying such Partner’s or Withdrawn
Partner’s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or
otherwise making available to the Partnership, on a first priority
basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his Firm
Collateral in satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any
Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess
Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and
otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in
the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first
priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of
the
 
26




Partnership to realize on (if
required), such Firm Collateral; provided , that in the case
of entities listed in the books and records of the Partnership, in
which Partners/members are permitted to pledge their interests
therein to finance all or a portion of their capital contributions
thereof (“ Pledgable Blackstone Interests ”), to
the extent a first priority security interest is unavailable
because of an existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or
Withdrawn Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall
grant the Partnership a second priority security interest therein
in the manner provided above; provided further , that
(x) to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second
priority security interest in Pledgable Blackstone Interests is
available, or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines
in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm
Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not
necessary or appropriate, the Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall
(in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above)
irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited
liability company or other entity listed on Exhibit A to remit any
and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization
on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in
clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided
hereunder.

(B) If upon a sale or other
realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a “
Firm Collateral Realization ”), the remaining Firm
Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner’s or
Withdrawn Partner’s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to
100% of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including
distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in
the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the
Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement
(allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be
deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds
from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount
necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement shall be
distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner.

(C) Upon any valuation or
revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a decreased
valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is
insufficient to cover any Partner’s or Withdrawn
Partner’s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm
Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining
Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner’s or
Withdrawn Partner’s Excess Holdback requirement), the
Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner
or Withdrawn Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall,
within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or
additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount
necessary to satisfy his Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under
this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto;
provided , that the first sentence of
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default
under this clause (C); provided further , that for
purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under
this clause (C): (1) the term “GP-Related Defaulting
Party” where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as “defaulting
party” for purposes hereof and (2) the terms “Net
GP-Related Recontribution Amount” and “GP-Related
Recontribution Amount” where such terms appear in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due
pursuant to this clause (C).
 
27




(vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner may (i) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but
not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust
Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm
Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit
of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (ii) require the
Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise
required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm
Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit for the benefit of the
Trustee(s) (an “ L/C ”) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the
Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an “ L/C Partner
”) shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and
irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (A) short-term
deposits are rated at least A-1 by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s
(if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (B) long-term
deposits are rated at least A+ by S&P or A1 by Moody’s
(if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each a “
Required Rating ”). If the relevant rating of the
commercial bank issuing such L/C drops below the relevant Required
Rating, the L/C Partner shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30
days of such occurrence, a new L/C from a commercial bank whose
relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating,
in lieu of the insufficient L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term
expiring on a date earlier than the latest possible termination
date of BREP Europe III, the Trustee(s) shall be permitted to
drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Partner fails to provide a new L/C
from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to
the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days prior to the stated
expiration date of such existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify
an L/C Partner 10 days prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s)
may (as directed by the Partnership in the case of clause
(1) below) draw down on an L/C only if (1) such a
drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Partner’s obligation
relating to the Partnership’s obligations under the Clawback
Provisions or (2) an L/C Partner has not provided a new L/C
from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to
the relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash
and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at
least 30 days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in
accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by
the Partnership, shall return to any L/C Partner his L/C upon
(1) termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of the
Partnership’s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback
Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner satisfying his entire Holdback
obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed
by the Partnership, of all amounts in the Trust Account to Partners
or Withdrawn Partners. If an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his
Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Partnership, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account
to the Partners or Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of
such L/C Partner, an L/C Partner’s L/C may be reduced by an
amount corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm
Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion
released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership;
provided, that in no way shall the general release of any Trust
Income cause an L/C Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of
an L/C by any amount.

(vii)(A) Any in-kind distributions
by the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in
accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash.
The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind
distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net
proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed
to the Trust Account.

(B) In lieu of the foregoing, any
Existing Partner may pledge with respect to any in-kind
distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the
applicable books and records of the Partnership; provided ,
that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall
initially equal 130% of the required Holdback Amount for a period
of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115% of the
required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and
(D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent
such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum
percentage of the required Holdback Amount specified in the first
sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a
release of such excess amount from the Trust Account.
 
28




(viii)(A) Any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his Holdback (excluding
any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may,
to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been
previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided
herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income
thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to
such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such
Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Holdback (excluding
any Excess Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a first
priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a particular
Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount
of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as
more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such
Partner’s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall
sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is
necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and
otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) )to realize on (if
required), such Special Firm Collateral.

(B) If upon a distribution,
withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any
portion of any Special Firm Collateral (a “ Special Firm
Collateral Realization ”), the remaining Special Firm
Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral
that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection
with an Excess Holdback) is insufficient to cover any
Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Holdback (when taken
together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided
herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in
the Trust Account)), then up to 100% of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such
Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the
amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid
into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner)
to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be
Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such
Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount
necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback)
shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the
extent a Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or
Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral
Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to
promptly fund such Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s
deficiency with respect to his Holdback in cash or an
L/C.

(C) Upon any valuation or
revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any adjustment in
the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying
Fund (as provided in the books and records of the Partnership), if
such Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Special Firm
Collateral valued at less than such Partner’s Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the books and
records of the Partnership, taking into account other permitted
means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall
provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and, within 10 business days of receiving such notice, such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional
Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary
to make up such deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that
clause (A) of the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)
shall be deemed inapplicable to such default; provided
further , that for purposes of applying
 
29




Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default
under this clause (C): (I) the term “GP-Related
Defaulting Party” where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as “defaulting
party” for purposes hereof and (II) the terms
“GP-Related Net Recontribution Amount” and
“GP-Related Recontribution Amount” where such terms
appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C).

(D) Upon a Partner becoming a
Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may
revoke the ability of such Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm
Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii),
notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In
that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to
the Withdrawn Partner’s obligation to satisfy the Holdback
(except that 30 days’ notice of such revocation shall be
given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer
available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any
Excess Holdback).

(E) Nothing in this
Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner from using any amount of such Partner’s interest in a
Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided that at all
times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are
each satisfied.

Section 4.2. 
Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners’
capital (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and,
if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in
any other investment of the Partnership) shall be credited to the
Partners’ GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each
accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other
time as determined by the General Partner, at rates determined by
the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an
expense of the Partnership.

Section 4.3. 
Withdrawals of Capital . The Partners may not withdraw
capital related to such Partner’s GP-Related Partner Interest
from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or
other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, or (iii) as determined
by the General Partner.

ARTICLE V

Section 5.1.  General
Accounting Matters . (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss)
shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in
Section 5.4.

(b) “ GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) ” from any activity of the Partnership related to
the Partnerships GP-Related BREA Europe III Interest for any
accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
GP-Related Investments described below) means (i) the gross
income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such
accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership,
and all other items that are deductible from gross income, for such
accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined
as provided below).

“ GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) ” from any GP-Related Investment for any
accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been
sold or otherwise disposed of means (i) the gross amount of
dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership
from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less
(ii) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting
period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment (determined
as provided below).
 
30



“ GP-Related Net Income (Loss)
” from any GP-Related Investment for the accounting period in
which such GP-Related Investment is sold or otherwise disposed of
means (i) the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of such GP-Related Investment and the gross amount of
dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership
from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less
(ii) the sum of the cost or other basis to the Partnership of
such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the Partnership for
such accounting period that are allocable to such GP-Related
Investment.

GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) shall be
determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the
Partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes with the following
adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt
from U.S. federal income taxation and not otherwise taken into
account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to
such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value on
the books of the Partnership that differs from its adjusted tax
basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation,
amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset
shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon
an adjustment to the value of any asset on the books of the
Partnership pursuant to Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the
amount of the adjustment shall be included as gain or loss in
computing such taxable income or loss; (iv) any expenditures
of the Partnership not deductible in computing taxable income or
loss, not properly capitalizable and not otherwise taken into
account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) pursuant to this
definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any
income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership
employees in respect of “phantom interests” in such
GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees
shall be included as an expense in the calculation of GP-Related
Net Income (Loss) from such GP-Related Investment, and
(vi) items of income and expense (including interest income
and overhead and other indirect expenses) of the Partnership and
Affiliates of the Partnership shall be allocated among the
Partnership and such Affiliates, among various Partnership
activities and GP-Related Investments and between accounting
periods, in each case as determined by the General Partner. The
General Partner may adjust GP-Related Net Income (Loss) as it deems
appropriate from time to time, including adjustments for items of
income accrued but not yet received, unrealized gains, items of
expense accrued but not yet paid, unrealized losses, reserves
(including reserves for taxes, bad debts, actual or threatened
litigation, or any other expenses, contingencies or obligations)
and other appropriate items, and any such adjustment, if made,
shall be made in accordance with GAAP; ( provided , that the
General Partner shall not be required to make any such
adjustment).

(c) An accounting period shall be a
Fiscal Year except that, at the option of the General Partner, an
accounting period will terminate and a new accounting period will
begin on the admission date of an additional Partner or the
Settlement Date of a Withdrawn Partner, if any such date is not the
first day of a Fiscal Year. If any event referred to in the
preceding sentence occurs and the General Partner does not elect to
terminate an accounting period and begin a new accounting period,
then the General Partner may make such adjustments as it deems
appropriate to the Partners’ GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentages for the accounting period in which such event occurs
(prior to any allocations of GP-Related Unallocated Percentages or
adjustments to GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages pursuant to
Section 5.3) to reflect the Partners’ average GP-Related
Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting period;
provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of
Partners in GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from GP-Related
Investments acquired during such accounting period will be based on
GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages in effect when each such
GP-Related Investment was acquired.

(d) In establishing GP-Related
Profit Sharing Percentages and allocating GP-Related Unallocated
Percentages pursuant to Section 5.3, the General Partner may
consider such factors as it deems appropriate.
 
31




(e) All determinations, valuations
and other matters of judgment required to be made for accounting
purposes under this Agreement shall be made by the General Partner
and approved by the Partnership’s independent accountants.
Such approved determinations, valuations and other accounting
matters shall be conclusive and binding on all Partners, all
Withdrawn Partners, their successors, heirs, estates or legal
representatives and any other person, and to the fullest extent
permitted by law no such person shall have the right to an
accounting or an appraisal of the assets of the Partnership or any
successor thereto.

Section 5.2.  Capital
Accounts . (a) There shall be established for each Partner
on the books of the Partnership, to the extent and at such times as
may be appropriate, one or more capital accounts as the General
Partner may deem to be appropriate for purposes of accounting for
such Partner’s interests in the capital in respect of such
Partner’s GP-Related Partner Interest and GP-Related Net
Income (Loss) of the Partnership (each a “ GP-Related
Capital Account ”).

(b) As of the end of each accounting
period or, in the case of a contribution to the Partnership by one
or more of the Partners in respect of such Partner or
Partners’ GP-Related Partner Interests or a distribution by
the Partnership to one or more of the Partners in respect of such
Partner or Partners’ GP-Related Partner Interests, at the
time of such contribution or distribution, (i) the appropriate
GP-Related Capital Accounts of each Partner shall be credited with
the following amounts: (A) the amount of cash and the value of
any property contributed by such Partner to the capital of the
Partnership in respect of such Partner’s GP-Related Partner
Interest during such accounting period, (B) the GP-Related Net
Income allocated to such Partner for such accounting period and
(C) the interest credited on the balance of such
Partner’s capital in respect of such Partner’s
GP-Related Partner Interest for such accounting period pursuant to
Section 4.2; and (ii) the appropriate GP-Related Capital
Accounts of each Partner shall be debited with the following
amounts: (x) the amount of cash, the principal amount of any
subordinated promissory note of the Partnership referred to in
Section 6.5 (as such amount is paid) and the value of any
property distributed to such Partner in respect of such
Partner’s GP-Related Partner Interest during such accounting
period and (y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated to such
Partner for such accounting period.

Section 5.3.

the Partnership prior to the final disposition of such claim,

repay such amount to the extent that it shall be subsequently

indemnified as authorized in this Section, and the Partnership and

to the Partnership, except as may be waived by the General Partner,
that such Limited Partner is acquiring each of such Limited
Partner’s Interests for such Limited Partner’s own
account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute
the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any
interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Limited
Partner hereunder. Each Limited Partner represents and warrants
that such Limited Partner understands that the Interests have not
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore such
Interests may not be resold without registration under such Act or
exemption from such registration, and that accordingly such Limited
Partner must bear the economic risk of an investment in the
Partnership for an indefinite period of time. Each Limited Partner
represents that such Limited Partner has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that such Limited
Partner is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Partnership, and that such Limited Partner is
able to bear the economic risk of such investment. Each Limited
Partner represents that such Limited Partner’s overall
commitment to the Partnership and other investments which are not
readily marketable is not disproportionate to the Limited
Partner’s net worth and the Limited Partner has no need for
liquidity in the Limited Partner’s investment in Interests.
Each Limited Partner represents that to the full satisfaction of
the Limited Partner, the Limited Partner has been furnished any
materials that such Limited Partner has requested relating to the
Partnership, any Investment and the offering of Interests and has
been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of representatives
of the Partnership concerning the terms and conditions of the
offering of Interests and any matters pertaining to each Investment
and to obtain any other additional information relating thereto.
Each Limited Partner represents that the Limited Partner has
consulted to the extent deemed appropriate by the Limited Partner
with the Limited Partner’s own advisers as to the financial,
tax, legal and related matters concerning an investment in
Interests and on that basis believes that an investment in the
Interests is suitable and appropriate for the Limited
Partner.

(b) Each Partner agrees that the
representations and warranties contained in paragraph
(a) above shall be true and correct as of any date that such
Partner (1) makes a capital contribution to the Partnership
(whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Partner or
otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Partner hereby
agrees that such capital contribution shall serve as confirmation
thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the principal amount
of a Firm Advance, and such Partner hereby agrees that such
repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

Representation . Each Limited Partner certifies that

Limited Partners (other than Special Limited Partners or any
Affiliates thereof) shall not be required to make additional
GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Partnership except
(i) as a condition of an increase in such Limited
Partner’s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage, or
(ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement;
provided , however , that the General Partner and any
Partner (other than BSSF Europe (Cayman)) may agree from time to
time that such Partner shall make an additional GP-Related Capital
Contribution to the Partnership; and provided further
that each Investor Limited Partner shall maintain its GP-Related
Capital Account at a level equal to the product of (i) its
GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and
(ii) the total capital of the Partnership related to the
Partnership’s GP-Related Associates Partner Interest;
provided further , that the foregoing in no way
limits any other provision of this Agreement (including without
limitation, Sections 5.8(d) and (e) and 6.5) or of any written
agreement between a Partner and the Partnership or an Affiliate
thereof which requires the making of any such additional GP-Related
Capital Contribution; provided further , that if
required by applicable law, the maximum amount of capital a Partner
is obligated to contribute to the Partnership at any time in
respect of such Partner’s GP-Related Partner Interest shall
be disclosed in a Certificate filed in accordance with the
Partnership Act; and provided further , that, any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, BSSF
Europe (Cayman) shall be required to make a maximum capital
contribution of (U.S.)$10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
unfunded amount of the commitment of any Partner (other than BSSF
Europe (Cayman)) to make GP-Related Capital Contributions to the
Partnership (such Partner’s “ Unfunded
Commitment ”) may be determined and redetermined by the
General Partner from time to time (including, without limitation,
any redetermination that results in a reduction in such
Partner’s Unfunded Commitment, which reduction may be
retroactive); provided that each Partner (other than BSSF
Europe (Cayman)) agrees to make GP-Related Capital
 
24


Contributions in the full amount of such
Partner’s Unfunded Commitment at any time, on condition that
the General Partner does not thereafter make a redetermination that
results in a reduction in such Partner’s Unfunded Commitment
and subject to all other terms and conditions set forth herein
and/or in any other agreement relating thereto; and provided
further , that, following an initial determination of the
commitment of a Partner (other than BSSF Europe (Cayman)), such
Partner’s Unfunded Commitment shall not be increased without
the consent of such Partner. Any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, no GP-Related Capital Contribution shall
become due and payable or be required to be made by any Partner,
unless and until it shall be called by the General Partner for the
purposes set forth herein or in the Commitment Agreement of such
Partner.

(b) The General Partner may elect on
a case by case basis to (i) cause the Partnership to loan any
Partner (including any additional Partner admitted to the
Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Partners
that are also executive officers of Blackstone) the amount of any
GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such Partner
or (ii) permit any Partner (including any additional Partner
admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 6.1) to make a
required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Partnership in
installments, in each case on terms determined by the General
Partner in accordance with Section 5.2.

(c) Each GP-Related Capital
Contribution by a Partner shall be credited to the appropriate
GP-Related Capital Account of such Partner in accordance with
Section 5.2.

(d) (i) The Partners and the
Withdrawn Partners have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant
to which certain amounts of the distributions relating to the
Carried Interest will be paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the
Trust Account (such amounts to be paid to the Trustee(s) for
deposit in the Trust Account constituting a “ Holdback
”). The General Partner shall determine, as set forth below,
the percentage of each distribution of Carried Interest that shall
be withheld for BSSF Europe GP Delaware and each Partner Category
(such withheld percentage constituting BSSF Europe GP
Delaware’s and such Partner Category’s “
Holdback Percentage ”). The applicable Holdback
Percentages initially shall be 0% for BSSF Europe GP Delaware, 15%
for Existing Partners (other than BSSF Europe GP Delaware), 21% for
Retaining Withdrawn Partners (other than BSSF Europe GP Delaware)
and 24% for Deceased Partners (the “ Initial Holdback
Percentages ”). Any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for BSSF Europe
GP Delaware shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii),
(iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d).

(ii) The Holdback Percentage may not
be reduced for any individual Partner as compared to the other
Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in clause
(iv) below). The General Partner may only reduce the Holdback
Percentages among the Partner Categories on a proportionate basis.
For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Partners is
decreased to 12.5%, the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn
Partners and Deceased Partners shall be reduced to 17.5% and 20%,
respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any
Partner shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such reduction.

(iii) The Holdback Percentage may
not be increased for any individual Partner as compared to the
other Partners in his Partner Category (except as provided in
clause (iv) below). The General Partner may not increase the
Retaining Withdrawn Partners’ Holdback Percentage beyond 21%
unless the General Partner concurrently increases the Existing
Partners’ Holdback Percentage to 21%. The General Partner may
not increase the Deceased Partners’ Holdback Percentage
beyond 24% unless the General Partner increases the Holdback
Percentage for both Existing Partners and Retaining Withdrawn
Partners to 24%. The General Partner may
 
25



not increase the Holdback Percentage
of any Partner Category beyond 24% unless such increase applies
equally to all Partner Categories. Any increase in the Holdback
Percentage for any Partner shall apply only to distributions
relating to Carried Interest made after the date of such increase.
The foregoing shall in no way prevent the General Partner from
proportionately increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Partner
Category (following a reduction of the Holdback Percentages below
the Initial Holdback Percentages), if the resulting Holdback
Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the
General Partner reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing
Partners, Retaining Withdrawn Partners and Deceased Partners to
12.5%, 17.5% and 20%, respectively, the General Partner shall have
the right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to the
Initial Holdback Percentages.

(iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Partnership may increase or
decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Partner in any Partner
Category (in such capacity, the “ Subject Partner
”) pursuant to a majority vote of the Special Limited
Partners and BSSF Europe GP Delaware (a “ Holdback
Vote ”); provided , that a Subject Partner’s
Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such
time as such Subject Partner (x) is notified by the
Partnership of the decision to increase such Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage and (y) has, if requested
by such Subject Partner, been given 30 days to gather and provide
information to the Partnership for consideration before a second
Holdback Vote (requested by the Subject Partner) and (II) decreased
unless such decrease occurs subsequent to an increase in a Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote
under this clause (iv); provided further , that such
decrease shall not exceed an amount such that such Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage is less than the prevailing
Holdback Percentage for such Subject Partner’s Partner
Category; provided further , that a Partner shall not
vote to increase a Subject Partner’s Holdback Percentage
unless such voting partner determines, in his good faith judgment,
that the facts and circumstances indicate that it is reasonably
likely that such Subject Partner, or any of his successors or
assigns (including his estate or heirs) who at the time of such
vote holds the Partnership interest or otherwise has the right to
receive distributions relating thereto, will not be capable of
satisfying any GP-Related Recontribution Amounts that may become
due.

(B) A Holdback Vote shall take place
at a Partnership meeting. Each of the Special Limited Partners and
BSSF Europe GP Delaware shall be entitled to cast one vote with
respect to the Holdback Vote regardless of such Partner’s
interest in the Partnership. Such vote may be cast by any such
Partner in person or by proxy.

(C) If the result of the second
Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Partner’s Holdback
Percentage, such Subject Partner may submit the decision to an
arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both
the Subject Partner and the Partnership; provided , that if
the Partnership and the Subject Partner cannot agree upon a
mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second
Holdback Vote, each of the Partnership and the Subject Partner
shall request its candidate for arbitrator to select a third
arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided
further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a
mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request,
the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association
shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Partner that
submits the decision of the Partnership pursuant to the second
Holdback Vote to arbitration and the Partnership shall estimate
their reasonably projected out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto
and each such party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator
and prior to any determination being made by the arbitrator, pay
the total of such estimated expenses (i.e., both the Subject
Partner’s
 
26



and the Partnership’s
expenses) into an escrow account to be controlled by Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett, as escrow agent (or such other
comparable law firm as the Partnership and Subject Partner shall
agree). The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of
such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration
(including costs leading thereto) and to return to the
“victorious” party the entire amount of funds such
party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to
the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the
expenses of such arbitration, such “losing” party shall
then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to
such “victorious” party. For purposes hereof, the
“victorious” party shall be the Partnership, if the
Holdback Percentage ultimately determined by the arbitrator is
closer to the percentage determined in the second Holdback Vote
than it is to the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the Subject
Partner’s Partner Category; otherwise, the Subject Partner
shall be the “victorious” party. The party that is not
the “victorious” party shall be the
“losing” party.

(D) In the event of a decrease in a
Subject Partner’s Holdback Percentage (1) pursuant to a
Holdback Vote under this clause (iv) or (2) pursuant to a
decision of an arbitrator under paragraph (C) of this clause
(iv), the Partnership shall release and distribute to such Subject
Partner any Trust Amounts (and the Trust Income thereon (except as
expressly provided herein with respect to using Trust Income as
Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required Holdback of such
Subject Partner (in accordance with such Subject Partner’s
reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced Holdback
Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject
Partner’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback
Vote under this clause (iv).

(v) (A) If a Partner’s
Holdback Percentage exceeds 15% (such percentage in excess of 15%
constituting the “ Excess Holdback Percentage
”), such Partner may satisfy the portion of his Holdback
obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such
portion constituting such Partner’s “ Excess
Holdback ”), and such Partner (or a Withdrawn Partner
with respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he
was a Partner), to the extent his Excess Holdback obligation has
previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the
Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain
in the Trust Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner) satisfying such Partner’s or Withdrawn
Partner’s Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or
otherwise making available to the Partnership, on a first priority
basis (except as provided below), all or any portion of his Firm
Collateral in satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any
Partner seeking to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess
Holdback utilizing Firm Collateral shall sign such documents and
otherwise take such other action as is necessary or appropriate (in
the good faith judgment of the General Partner) to perfect a first
priority security interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of
the Partnership to realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral;
provided , that in the case of entities listed in the books
and records of the Partnership, in which Partners/members are
permitted to pledge their interests therein to finance all or a
portion of their capital contributions thereof (“
Pledgable Blackstone Interests ”), to the extent a
first priority security interest is unavailable because of an
existing lien on such Firm Collateral, the Partner or Withdrawn
Partner seeking to utilize such Firm Collateral shall grant the
Partnership a second priority security interest therein in the
manner provided above; provided further , that
(x) to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second
priority security interest in Pledgable Blackstone Interests is
available, or (y) if the General Partner otherwise determines
in its good faith judgment that a security interest in Firm
Collateral (and the corresponding documents and actions) are not
necessary or appropriate, the
 
27



Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall
(in the case of either clause (x) or (y) above)
irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant partnership, limited
liability company or other entity listed on Exhibit A to remit any
and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization
on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in
clause (B) below. The Partnership shall, at the request of any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner, assist such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner in taking such action as is necessary to enable such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner to use Firm Collateral as provided
hereunder.

(B) If upon a sale or other
realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral (a “
Firm Collateral Realization ”), the remaining Firm
Collateral is insufficient to cover any Partner’s or
Withdrawn Partner’s Excess Holdback requirement, then up to
100% of the net proceeds otherwise distributable to such Partner or
Withdrawn Partner from such Firm Collateral Realization (including
distributions subject to the repayment of financing sources as in
the case of Pledgable Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the
Trust Account to fully satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement
(allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) and shall be
deemed to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds
from such Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount
necessary to satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement shall be
distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner.

(C) Upon any valuation or
revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a decreased
valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm Collateral is
insufficient to cover any Partner’s or Withdrawn
Partner’s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm
Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining
Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Partner’s or
Withdrawn Partner’s Excess Holdback requirement), the
Partnership shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner
or Withdrawn Partner and such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall,
within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or
additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount
necessary to satisfy his Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner defaults upon his obligations under
this clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto;
provided , that the first sentence of
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default
under this clause (C); provided further , that for
purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under
this clause (C): (1) the term “GP-Related Defaulting
Party” where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as “defaulting
party” for purposes hereof and (2) the terms “Net
GP-Related Recontribution Amount” and “GP-Related
Recontribution Amount” where such terms appear in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due
pursuant to this clause (C).

(vi) Any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner may (i) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but
not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust
Account and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner) or Firm
Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit
of such Partner or Withdrawn Partner or (ii) require the
Partnership to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise
required to be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm
Collateral), by obtaining a letter of credit for the benefit of the
Trustee(s) (an “ L/C ”) in such amounts. Any
Partner or Withdrawn Partner choosing to furnish an L/C to the
Trustee(s) (in such capacity, an “ L/C Partner
”) shall deliver to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and
irrevocable L/C from a commercial bank whose (A) short-term
deposits are rated at least A-1 by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s
(if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or less), or (B) long-term
deposits are rated at least A+ by S&P or A1 by Moody’s
(if the L/C is for a term of 1 year or more) (each
 
28



a “ Required Rating
”). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing
such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Partner
shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence,
a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least
equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient
L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier
than the latest possible termination date of BSSF Europe, the
Trustee(s) shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C
Partner fails to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose
relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating,
at least 30 days prior to the stated expiration date of such
existing L/C. The Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Partner 10 days
prior to drawing on any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the
Partnership in the case of clause (1) below) draw down on an
L/C only if (1) such a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C
Partner’s obligation relating to the Partnership’s
obligations under the Clawback Provisions or (2) an L/C
Partner has not provided a new L/C from a commercial bank whose
relevant rating is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating
(or the requisite amount of cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the
extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30 days prior to the stated
expiration of an existing L/C in accordance with this clause (vi).
The Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, shall return to any
L/C Partner his L/C upon (1) termination of the Trust Account
and satisfaction of the Partnership’s obligations, if any, in
respect of the Clawback Provisions, (2) an L/C Partner
satisfying his entire Holdback obligation in cash and Firm
Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder), or (3) the
release, by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, of all
amounts in the Trust Account to Partners or Withdrawn Partners. If
an L/C Partner satisfies a portion of his Holdback obligation in
cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or
if the Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership, release a
portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to the Partners or
Withdrawn Partners in the Partner Category of such L/C Partner, an
L/C Partner’s L/C may be reduced by an amount corresponding
to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the
extent permitted hereunder) or such portion released by the
Trustee(s), as directed by the Partnership; provided, that in no
way shall the general release of any Trust Income cause an L/C
Partner to be permitted to reduce the amount of an L/C by any
amount.

(vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions
by the Partnership relating to Carried Interest shall be made in
accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash.
The Partnership may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind
distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net
proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed
to the Trust Account.

(B) In lieu of the foregoing, any
Existing Partner may pledge with respect to any in-kind
distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in the
applicable books and records of the Partnership; provided ,
that the initial contribution of such Special Firm Collateral shall
initially equal 130% of the required Holdback Amount for a period
of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least 115% of the
required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs 4.1(d)(viii)(C) and
(D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the extent
such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum
percentage of the required Holdback Amount specified in the first
sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Partner may obtain a
release of such excess amount from the Trust Account.

(viii) (A) Any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner may satisfy all or any portion of his Holdback (excluding
any Excess Holdback), and such Partner or a Withdrawn Partner may,
to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) has been
previously satisfied in cash or by the use of an L/C as provided
herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income
thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and allocated to
such Partner or
 
29



Withdrawn Partner) that satisfy such
Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Holdback (excluding
any Excess Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a first
priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a particular
Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed the amount
of the Holdback distributed to the Partner or Withdrawn Partner (as
more fully set forth below). Any Partner seeking to satisfy such
Partner’s Holdback utilizing Special Firm Collateral shall
sign such documents and otherwise take such other action as is
necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner) to perfect a first priority security interest in, and
otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) )to realize on (if
required), such Special Firm Collateral.

(B) If upon a distribution,
withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of all or any
portion of any Special Firm Collateral (a “ Special Firm
Collateral Realization ”), the remaining Special Firm
Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm Collateral
that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in connection
with an Excess Holdback) is insufficient to cover any
Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Holdback (when taken
together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided
herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in
the Trust Account)), then up to 100% of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner from such
Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the
amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be paid
into the Trust (and allocated to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner)
to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed thereafter to be
Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such
Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of the amount
necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback)
shall be distributed to such Partner or Withdrawn Partner. To the
extent a Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Partner or
Withdrawn Partner in connection with a Special Firm Collateral
Realization, such Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall be required to
promptly fund such Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s
deficiency with respect to his Holdback in cash or an
L/C.

(C) Upon any valuation or
revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any adjustment in
the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a Qualifying
Fund (as provided in the books and records of the Partnership), if
such Partner’s or Withdrawn Partner’s Special Firm
Collateral valued at less than such Partner’s Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the books and
records of the Partnership, taking into account other permitted
means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Partnership shall
provide notice of the foregoing to such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner and, within 10 business days of receiving such notice, such
Partner or Withdrawn Partner shall contribute cash or additional
Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary
to make up such deficiency. If any such Partner or Withdrawn
Partner defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that
clause (A) of the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)
shall be deemed inapplicable to such default; provided
further , that for purposes of applying
Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C):
(I) the term “GP-Related Defaulting Party” where
such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be
construed as “defaulting party” for purposes hereof and
(II) the terms “GP-Related Net Recontribution Amount”
and “GP-Related Recontribution Amount” where such terms
appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C).
 
30



(D) Upon a Partner becoming a
Withdrawn Partner, at any time thereafter the General Partner may
revoke the ability of such Withdrawn Partner to use Special Firm
Collateral as set forth in this Section 4.1(d)(viii),
notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In
that case the provisions of clause (C) above shall apply to
the Withdrawn Partner’s obligation to satisfy the Holdback
(except that 30 days’ notice of such revocation shall be
given), given that the Special Firm Collateral is no longer
available to satisfy any portion of the Holdback (excluding any
Excess Holdback).

(E) Nothing in this
Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Partner or Withdrawn
Partner from using any amount of such Partner’s interest in a
Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided that at all
times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are
each satisfied.

Section 4.2. 
Interest . Interest on the balances of the Partners’
capital (excluding capital invested in GP-Related Investments and,
if deemed appropriate by the General Partner, capital invested in
any other investment of the Partnership) shall be credited to the
Partners’ GP-Related Capital Accounts at the end of each
accounting period pursuant to Section 5.2, or at any other
time as determined by the General Partner, at rates determined by
the General Partner from time to time, and shall be charged as an
expense of the Partnership.

Section 4.3. 
Withdrawals of Capital . The Partners may not withdraw
capital related to such Partner’s GP-Related Partner Interest
from the Partnership except (i) for distributions of cash or
other property pursuant to Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, or (iii) as determined
by the General Partner.

ARTICLE V

PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND
LOSSES

Section 5.1.  General
Accounting Matters . (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss)
shall be determined by the General Partner at the end of each
accounting period and shall be allocated as described in
Section 5.4.

(b) “ GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) ” from any activity of the Partnership related to
the Partnership’s GP-Related Associates Interest for any
accounting period (other than GP-Related Net Income (Loss) from
GP-Related Investments described below) means (i) the gross
income realized by the Partnership from such activity during such
accounting period less (ii) all expenses of the Partnership,
and all other items that are deductible from gross income, for such
accounting period that are allocable to such activity (determined
as provided below).

“ GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) ” from any GP-Related Investment for any
accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment has not been
sold or otherwise disposed of means (i) the gross amount of
dividends, interest or other income received by the Partnership
from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting period less
(ii) all expenses of the Partnership for such accounting
period that are allocable to such GP-Related Investment (determined
as provided below).

“ GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) ” from any GP-Related Investment for the
accounting period in which such GP-Related Investment is sold or
otherwise disposed of means (i) the sum of the gross proceeds
from the sale or other disposition of such GP-Related Investment
and the gross amount of dividends,
 
31


interest or other income received by the
Partnership from such GP-Related Investment during such accounting
period less (ii) the sum of the cost or other basis to the
Partnership of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of the
Partnership for such accounting period that are allocable to such
GP-Related Investment.

GP-Related Net Income
(Loss) shall be
determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the
Partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes with the following
adjustments: (i) any income of the Partnership that is exempt
from U.S. federal income taxation and not otherwise taken into
account in computing GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be added to
such taxable income or loss; (ii) if any asset has a value on
the books of the Partnership that differs from its adjusted tax
basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any depreciation,
amortization or gain resulting from a disposition of such asset
shall be calculated with reference to such value; (iii) upon
an adjustment to the value of any asset on the books of the
Partnership pursuant to Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2), the

definition shall be treated as deductible items; (v) any
income from a GP-Related Investment that is payable to Partnership
employees in respect of “phantom interests” in such
GP-Related Investment awarded by the General Partner to employees

Profit Sharing Percentages during such accounting period;
provided , that the GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentages of

period and (y) the GP-Related Net Loss allocated to such
Partner for such accounting period.
