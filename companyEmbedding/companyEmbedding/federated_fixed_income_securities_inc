Prices of emerging-market and frontier-market securities can be significantly more volatile than the prices of securities in developed countries, and currency risk and political risks are accentuated in emerging markets.   Mutual funds are subject to risks and fluctuate in value.   Bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices.   High-yield, lower-rated securities generally entail greater market, credit/default and liquidity risks and may be more volatile than investment-grade securities.

Invests primarily in a strategic mix of floating rate fixed-income investments, which pay interest at rates that increase or decrease with changes in market rates. Has broad flexibility to invest across a unique range of non-correlated floating rate sectors: U.S. non-investment grade (primarily floating-rate bank loans); U.S. investment grade (primarily adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities); and international (primarily floating-rate trade finance instruments). Management team strategically positions the fund in the most attractive floating rate sectors (up to 75% in any sector) and adjusts the sector mix and duration based on relative valuations and economic and market conditions.

Bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices.   High-yield, lower-rated securities generally entail greater market, credit/default and liquidity risks and may be more volatile than investment-grade securities.   International investing involves special risks including currency risk, increased volatility, political risks, and differences in auditing and other financial standards.   The value of some mortgage-backed securities may be particularly sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates, and although the securities are generally supported by some form of government or private insurance, there is no assurance that private guarantors or insurers will meet their obligations.   Variable and floating-rate loans and securities generally are less sensitive to interest rate changes but may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much or as quickly as interest rates in general. Conversely, variable and floating-rate loans and securities generally will not increase in value as much as fixed-rate debt instruments if interest rates decline.   Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss.   In addition to the risks generally associated with debt instruments, such as credit, market, interest rate, liquidity and derivatives risks, bank loans are also subject to the risk that the value of the collateral securing a loan may decline, be insufficient to meet the obligations of the borrower, or be difficult to liquidate.

	Portfolio Turnover


	The
	Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in
	higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year,
	the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 22% of the average value of its portfolio.

	RISK/RETURN SUMMARY: INVESTMENTS,
	RISKS and PERFORMANCE


	What are the Fund's Main
	Investment Strategies?


	The
	Fund allocates the portfolio among three categories of fixed-income investments: domestic investment-grade (including, but not limited to, U.S. government, mortgage-backed and corporate), domestic noninvestment-grade
	corporate (also known as junk bonds and leveraged loans) and foreign investments (both investment-grade and non-investment grade, including, but not limited to, government and corporate investments traded in both
	emerging and developed markets, and trade finance). Based upon historical returns, the Fund's investment adviser (“Adviser”) expects the three categories of investments to have different returns and risks
	under similar market conditions. The Adviser relies on the differences in the expected performance of each category to manage risks by allocating the Fund's portfolio among the three categories. The Adviser seeks to
	enhance the Fund's performance by allocating more of its portfolio to the category that the Adviser expects to offer the best balance between risk and return. While the Fund's portfolio usually includes securities
	from all three categories, the Fund limits the amount it may invest in a single category to 60% of its assets. In addition

	,

	when the Adviser considers the risk/return prospects of equity securities to be attractive, the Fund may also opportunistically invest up to 20% of its assets in equity securities,
	including common stocks, preferred stocks, warrants, convertible securities, and pooled investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or other investment companies. Pooled vehicles are utilized in order to
	gain broad exposure to the equity market. The Fund may also invest in derivative contracts or hybrid instruments (such as, for example, futures contracts, option contracts and swap contracts) to implement its
	investment strategies as more fully described herein. The Adviser may invest in bonds of any maturity. The Fund may at times use derivative securities to take a position on interest rate moves.


	Certain
	of the government securities in which the Fund invests are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, such as those issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie
	Mac”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Bank System. These entities are, however, supported through federal subsidies, loans or other benefits. The
	Fund may also invest in government securities that are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, such as those issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”).
	Finally, the Fund may invest in a few government securities that have no explicit financial support, but which are regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors their activities.


	Because
	the Fund refers to fixed-income investments in its name, it will notify shareholders at least 60 days in advance of any change in its investment policies that would enable the Fund to normally invest less than 80% of
	its assets in fixed-income investments.

	What are the Main Risks of
	Investing in the Fund?


	All
	mutual funds take investment risks. Therefore, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The primary factors that may reduce the Fund's returns include:





	■ 


	Interest Rate Risk.

	Prices of fixed-income securities generally fall when interest rates rise. Interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed-income securities with longer durations.
	Duration measures the price sensitivity of a fixed-income security to changes in interest rates.





	■ 


	Prepayment Risk

	. When homeowners prepay their mortgages in response to lower interest rates, the Fund will be required to reinvest the proceeds at the lower interest rates available. Also, when interest
	rates fall, the price of mortgage-backed securities may not rise to as great an extent as that of other fixed-income securities.





	■ 


	Call Risk

	. An issuer may redeem a fixed-income security before maturity (a call) at a price below its current market price.





	■ 


	Credit Risk

	. It is possible that interest or principal on securities will not be paid when due. Noninvestment-grade securities generally have a higher default risk than investment-grade securities.
	Such non-payments or default may reduce the value of the Fund's portfolio holdings, its share price and its performance.





	■ 


	Risk Associated with Noninvestment-Grade Securities.

	The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in securities rated below investment grade which may be subject to greater interest rate, credit and liquidity risks than investment-grade
	securities.





	■ 


	Risk Related to the Economy.

	The value of the Fund's portfolio may decline in tandem with a drop in the overall value of the stock market. Economic and financial conditions may from time to time, and for varying
	periods of time, cause volatility, illiquidity, shareholder redemptions, political and/or other potentially adverse effects in the financial markets. Among other investments, lower-grade corporate bond returns are
	sensitive to changes in the economy.





	■ 


	Currency Risk.

	Exchange rates for currencies fluctuate daily. Accordingly, the Fund may experience increased volatility with respect to the value of its Shares and its returns as a result of its exposure
	to foreign currencies through direct holding of such currencies or holding of non-U.S. dollar


	denominated securities.





	■ 


	Eurozone Related Risk.

	A number of countries in the European Union (EU) have experienced, and may continue to experience, severe economic and financial difficulties. Additional EU member countries may also fall
	subject to such difficulties. These events could negatively affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's investments in euro-denominated securities and derivatives contracts, securities of issuers located in the EU or
	with significant exposure to EU issuers or countries.








	4















	■ 


	Risk of Foreign Investing.

	Because the Fund invests in securities issued by foreign companies, the Fund's Share price may be more affected by foreign economic and political conditions, taxation policies and
	accounting and auditing standards than would otherwise be the case.





	■ 


	Risk of Investing in Emerging Market Countries

	. Securities issued or traded in emerging markets generally entail greater risks than securities issued or traded in developed markets. Emerging market economies may also experience more
	severe downturns (with corresponding currency devaluations) than developed economies.





	■ 


	Liquidity Risk.

	The fixed-income securities in which the Fund invests may be less readily marketable and may be subject to greater fluctuation in price than other securities. Liquidity risk also refers to
	the possibility that the Fund may not be able to sell a security or close out a derivative contract when it wants to. If this happens, the Fund could incur losses.





	■ 


	Leverage Risk.

	Leverage risk is created when an investment exposes the Fund to a level of risk that exceeds the amount invested. Changes in the value of such an investment magnify the Fund's risk of loss
	and potential for gain.





	■ 


	Risk of Investing in Derivative Contracts and Hybrid Instruments.

	Derivative contracts and hybrid instruments involve risks different from, or possibly greater than, risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional
	investments. Specific risk issues related to the use of such contracts and instruments include valuation and tax issues, increased potential for losses and/or costs to the Fund and a potential reduction in gains to
	the Fund. Each of these issues is described in greater detail in this Prospectus. Derivative contracts and hybrid instruments may also involve other risks described in this Prospectus or the Fund's Statement of
	Additional Information (SAI), such as interest rate, credit, currency, liquidity and leverage risks.





	■ 


	Exchange-Traded Funds Risk.

	An investment in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) generally presents the same primary risks as an investment in a conventional fund (i.e., one that is not exchange-traded) that has the same
	investment objectives, strategies and policies. The price of an ETF can fluctuate up or down, and the Fund could lose money investing in an ETF if the prices of the securities owned by the ETF go down.





	■ 


	Risk of Loss after Redemption.

	The Fund may also invest in trade finance loan instruments primarily by investing in other investment companies (which are not available for general investment by the public) that owns
	those instruments and that are advised by an affiliate of the Adviser and is structured as an extended payment fund (EPF). In the EPF, the Fund, as shareholder, will bear the risk of investment loss during the period
	between when shares of such EPF are presented to the transfer agent of the EPF for redemption and when the net asset value of the EPF is determined for payment of the redeemed EPF shares (the “Redemption Pricing
	Date”).








	5















	■ 


	Sector Risk.

	Companies with similar characteristics may be grouped together in broad categories called sectors. Sector risk is the possibility that a certain sector may underperform other sectors or
	the market as a whole. As the Adviser allocates more of the Fund's portfolio holdings to a particular sector, the Fund's performance will be more susceptible to any economic, business or other developments which
	generally affect that sector.





	■ 


	Stock Market Risk.

	The value of equity securities in the Fund's portfolio will fluctuate and, as a result, the Fund's Share price may decline suddenly or over a sustained period of time. Information publicly
	available about a company, whether from the company's financial statements or other disclosures or from third parties, or information available to some but not all market participants, can affect the price of a
	company's shares in the market.





	■ 


	Small Cap Company Risk.

	The Fund may invest in small capitalization (or “small-cap”) companies. Small-cap companies may have less liquid stock, a more volatile share price, unproven track records, a
	limited product or service base, and limited access to capital. The above factors could make small-cap companies more likely to fail than larger companies, and increase the volatility of the Fund's portfolio,
	performance and Share price.





	■ 


	Risk Related to Investing for Growth.

	Due to their relatively high valuations, growth stocks are typically more volatile than value stocks. For instance, the price of a growth stock may experience a larger decline on a forecast
	of lower earnings, a negative fundamental development, or an adverse market development. Further, growth stocks may not pay dividends or may pay lower dividends than value stocks. This means they depend more on price
	changes for returns and may be more adversely affected in a down market compared to value stocks that pay higher dividends.





	■ 


	Risk Related to Investing for Value.

	Due to their relatively low valuations, value stocks are typically less volatile than growth stocks. For instance, the price of a value stock may experience a smaller increase on a forecast
	of higher earnings, a positive fundamental development or positive market development. Further, value stocks tend to have higher dividends than growth stocks. This means they depend less on price changes for returns
	and may lag behind growth stocks in an up market.





	■ 


	Technology Risk.

	The Adviser uses various technologies in managing the Fund, consistent with its investment objective and strategy described in this prospectus. For example, proprietary and third-party
	data and systems are utilized to support decision making for the Fund. Data imprecision, software or other technology malfunctions, programming inaccuracies and similar circumstances may impair the performance of
	these systems, which may negatively affect Fund performance.






	The
	Shares offered by this Prospectus are not deposits or obligations of any bank, are not endorsed or guaranteed by any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government, the Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or any other government agency.

	Performance: Bar Chart and
	Table


	Risk/Return Bar Chart


	The bar
	chart and performance table below reflect historical performance data for the Fund and are intended to help you analyze the Fund's investment risks in light of its historical returns. The bar chart shows the
	variability of the Fund's A class total returns on a calendar year-by-year basis. The Average Annual Total Return table shows returns

	averaged

	over the stated periods, and includes comparative performance information.

	The Fund's performance will fluctuate, and past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of future results.

	Updated performance information for the Fund
	is available under the “Products” section at FederatedInvestors.com or by calling 1-800-341-7400.








	The total returns shown in the
	bar chart do not reflect the payment of any sales charges or recurring shareholder account fees. If these charges or fees had been included, the returns shown would have been lower.


	Within the periods shown in
	the bar chart, the Fund's A class highest quarterly return was 12.80% (quarter ended June 30, 2009). Its lowest quarterly return was (9.81)% (quarter ended December 31, 2008).


	Average Annual Total Return
	Table


	The
	Fund's IS class commenced operations on January 28, 2008. For the period prior to the commencement of operations of the IS class, the performance information shown below is for the A class. The performance of the A
	class has not been adjusted to reflect the expenses applicable to the IS class since the IS class has a lower expense ratio than the expense ratio of the A class. The performance of the A class has been adjusted to
	reflect the absence of sales charges and adjusted to remove any voluntary waiver of Fund expenses related to the A class that may have occurred during the period prior to the commencement of operations of the IS
	class.


	In
	addition to Return Before Taxes, Return After Taxes is shown for the Fund's A class to illustrate the effect of federal taxes on Fund returns. After-tax returns are shown only for the A class and after-tax returns for
	the B, C, F and IS classes will differ from those shown above for the A class.

	Actual after-tax returns depend on each investor's personal tax situation, and are likely to differ from those shown.

	After-tax returns are calculated using a standard set of
	assumptions. The




	7












	stated returns assume the highest
	historical

	federal

	income and capital gains tax rates. These after-tax returns do

	not

	reflect the effect of any applicable

	state

	and

	local

	taxes. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors holding Shares through tax-deferred programs, such as a 401(k) plan, an Individual Retirement Account or other
	tax-advantaged investment plan.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
