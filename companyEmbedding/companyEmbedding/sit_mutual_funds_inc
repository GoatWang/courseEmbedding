	Before you invest, you may want to review the Funds prospectus, which contains more information about
	the Fund and its risks. You can find the Funds prospectus and other information about the Fund online at

	www.sitfunds.com/open/documents.php

	. You can also get this information at no cost by calling 800-332-5580 or by sending an email
	request to

	info@sitinvest.com

	. If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary, the prospectus will also be available from your financial intermediary. The Funds prospectus and statement of
	additional information (SAI), both dated November 1, 2015, are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus and may be obtained at no cost online at the website, phone number, or email address listed above.





	INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



	The Fund seeks to maximize
	long-term capital appreciation.






	FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND



	This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund.


	 




















	Shareholder Fees


	(fees paid directly from your investment)




	  



	 




	 




	 












	Redemption Fee

	(as a percentage of amount redeemed only on shares held for less than 30 days)




	  


	 


	2.00%     


	  











	    



	  


	 


	 


	 






	Annual Fund Operating Expenses


	(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of
	the value of your investment)




	  



	 




	 




	 






	Management Fees



	  


	 


	2.00%     


	  





	Acquired Fund Fees and
	Expenses

	(1)




	  


	 


	0.01%     


	  





	Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses



	  


	 


	2.01%     


	  






	(1)

	The total annual fund operating expenses do not correlate to the ratio
	of expenses to average net assets shown in the Funds Financial Highlights, which does not include Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses represent fees and expenses incurred indirectly by the Fund as a result of its
	investment in shares of investment companies.



	Example



	This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. It assumes that you invest
	$10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated, that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the Funds operating expenses remain the same, and that you redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. Although your actual
	costs and returns may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:


	 




























	 


	 



	1 Year



	    



	3 Years



	    



	5 Years

	$636


	    


	$1,093


	    


	$2,355


	  





	PORTFOLIO TURNOVER



	The
	Fund pays transactions costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares
	are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 21.51% of the
	average value of the portfolio.

	Summary  Sit Developing Markets Growth Fund






	 





	PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES



	The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets in common stocks of companies domiciled
	or operating in a developing market.


	Developing markets are those countries that:


	 




	 




	>




	 


	have emerging stock markets as defined by the International Finance Corporation,
	                                         
	   




	 




	 




	>




	 


	have low-to middle-income economies according to the World Bank, or
	                                         
	                   




	 




	 




	>




	 


	have similar developing characteristics, for example, countries in the MSCI EM Index and Hong Kong are considered to be developing.




	As of September 30, 2015, the Fund held investments in Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, China, Singapore, Israel,
	India, Indonesia, Peru, Chile, Malaysia, Japan, Netherlands, and Turkey.


	In selecting investments for the Fund, the Adviser begins by selecting countries
	or regions in which to invest. In making its selections, the Adviser considers several factors affecting the economy and equity market of foreign countries and regions, including:


	 




	 




	>




	 


	economic trends,

	>




	 


	liquidity within the market,
	                                         
	                                         
	                                         
	         




	 




	 




	>




	 


	fiscal and monetary
	policy,                                        
	                                         
	                                         
	          




	 




	 




	>




	 


	currency exchange rate expectations,

	>




	 


	market sentiment, and
	                                         
	                                         
	                                         
	                 




	 




	 




	>




	 


	social and political trends.
	                                         
	                                         
	                                         
	         




	After the country and regional allocations are determined, the Adviser seeks
	industries and sectors that appear to have strong earnings growth prospects. Within the selected industries and sectors, the Adviser invests in foreign growth-oriented companies it believes exhibit the potential for superior growth. The Adviser
	believes that a companys earnings growth is the primary determinant of its potential long-term return and evaluates a companys potential for above average long-term earnings and revenue growth. Several factors are considered in the
	Advisers evaluation of a company, including:


	 




	 




	>




	 


	unique product or service,
	                                         
	                                         
	                                         
	             




	 




	 




	>




	 


	growing product demand,
	                                         
	                                         
	                                         
	             




	 




	 




	>




	 


	regional or country dominance and growing market share,
	                                         
	                                         
	  




	 




	 




	>




	 


	management experience and capabilities, and
	                                         
	                                         
	                      




	 




	 




	>




	 


	strong financial condition.
	                                         
	                                         
	                                         
	             




	When selling equity securities for the Fund, the Adviser
	considers several factors, including changes in a companys fundamentals and anticipated earnings.


	The Fund invests in small, medium and large sized
	companies. Small companies generally have capitalizations of under $3.0 billion, and large companies generally have a capitalization greater than $5 billion. The Fund may invest in securities representing underlying international securities such as
	sponsored American Depository Receipts, European Depository Receipts and Global Depository Receipts.


	In order to hedge against adverse movements in
	currency exchange rates, the Fund may from time to time enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts.

	Summary  Sit Developing Markets Growth Fund






	 





	PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS



	 




	 




	>




	 


	Developing Markets Risk: Investment in developing markets are subject to unique political, economic, and market risks that can cause the Funds investments to be more volatile and less liquid than investments
	in developed markets.




	 




	 




	>




	 


	Foreign Currency Hedging Transactions Risk: If the Advisers forecast of exchange rate movements is incorrect, the Fund may realize losses on their foreign currency transactions. In addition, the Funds
	hedging transactions may prevent the Funds from realizing the benefits of a favorable change in the value of foreign currencies.




	 




	 




	>




	 


	Growth Style Investing Risk:  Different types of stocks tend to shift into and out of favor with stock market investors depending on market and economic conditions. The Fund invests in growth style stocks. The
	Funds performance may at times be better or worse than the performance of funds that focus on other types of stocks or that have a broader investment style.




	 




	 




	>




	 


	International Investing Risk: International investing involves risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities which may adversely affect the Funds investment. These risks include currency
	risk, foreign securities market risk, foreign tax risk, information risk, investment restriction risk, and political and economic risks.




	 




	 




	>




	 


	Management Risk:  A strategy used by the investment management team may not produce the intended results.




	 




	 




	>




	 


	Market Risk:  The market value of securities may fall or fail to rise. Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, or the market as a whole. The market value of securities may fluctuate,
	sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.




	 




	 




	>




	 


	Mid Cap Stock Risk:  Stocks of mid cap stocks may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than stocks of larger, more established companies.




	 




	 




	>




	 


	Small Cap Stock Risk:  Stocks of smaller companies involve substantial risk. Prices of small cap stocks may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than stocks of larger, more established
	companies. Additionally, for certain small cap stocks, there may also be limited liquidity, or trading opportunities at a favorable price or time.








	HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE



	The following bar chart and
	table provide information on the Funds volatility and performance. The Funds past performance before and after taxes is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. The bar chart below is intended to provide

	individual retirement accounts.

	to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your intermediary or visit your intermediarys website for more information.

Global Investment Outlook and Strategy
July 2017



Synchronized global growth, improving corporate earnings, benign inflation, and positive economic surprises have contributed to the solid performance of U.S. Equities in 2017.  Earnings growth has been the driver of stock appreciation in 2017.  Potential economic outcomes from the Trump administration’s policies, if effectively implemented, could boost U.S. Economic growth, but the impact of Washington’s partisan conflicts and the Federal Reserve’s unwinding of its bloated balance sheet are unknown.
Increases in the target fed funds rate have continued to move short-term yields higher, while the modest reduction of stimulus has partially relieved fears of rising inflation, which resulted in modestly lower longer-term yields.  The taxable bonds yield curve has flattened with a historically steep position, and we expect it to assume a naturally flatter shape as the Fed continues to normalize monetary policy.  As a result of the Fed’s implementation of balnace sheet reduction, we expect spreads to increase modestly on current coupon mortgages and, coupled wit the anticipated rise in interest rates, could lead to meaningful increases in mortgage rates.
The AAA tax-exempt municipal bond yield curve flattened during the second quarter due primarily to sizable yield declines across the middle and the long end of the curve.  Meanwhile, yields rose slightly on maturities of two years and less.  All durations of municipal bond indices posted a second consecutive quarter of positive returns, with longer maturities performing best for the period.  All investment-grade municipal bond index returns continued to be positive on the year.  Bonds with A and/or BBB ratings have generally outperformed more highly rated bonds.
In Europe, Brexit-related uncertainty, the Italian general election, and the eventual moderation of accommodative monetary policy remain key issues, but Euro Area economic data has consistently surprised to the upside in 2017.  Business activity and consumer confidence measure are near historically high levels, with domestic demand continuing to be the driver of incremental growth.  Employment conditions are improving, yet economic momentum is starting to show signs of moderation.
