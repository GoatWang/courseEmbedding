Car Insurance
Car insurance covers you in case of an accident or theft. Save with an employee or association discount! For service, please call 1-800-422-4272 (individual policies) or 1-800-438-6381 (group customers).








Car Insurance



When you're in the driver's seat, keep your car, yourself, and your family protected with quality car insurance from MetLife Auto & Home®.
Why choose car insurance from MetLife Auto & Home?

Great savings. Save hundreds with discounts for good drivers and savings for every year you drive claim-free.1
Quality coverage. MetLife Auto & Home offers comprehensive and collision coverage and options to suit your needs. Many of our policies offer new car replacement, special parts replacement, enhanced rental car damage coverage and identity theft protection at no extra cost.2
Convenience. You decide: you can call to get personalized customer service and enhanced coverage, then choose between multiple payment options and schedules. With this option, you can access your policy information by phone, online or through our mobile app, anytime, anywhere. Or, you can quickly enter your information, get a quote, buy and manage your policy entirely online with MetLife Auto & Home MyDirectSM (not available in all states).

Group Car Insurance



If your employer offers MetLife Auto & Home's group car insurance program as part of your employee benefits, you could receive special savings. Some membership associations have discounts, too.

 Find out if you're eligible:

Group discounts. Most people saved an average of $536 per year!3 We can offer these savings because your employer provides you access to a group insurance program with special low rates as part of your employee benefits.
Coverage that stays with you. If you retire, leave your company or go on leave, you can still continue your coverage without interruption or change.
Great features. Even though the policy's cheaper, you'll still have access to all our policy benefits. These include replacement coverage for total loss, rewards for good driving, enhanced rental car damage coverage, identify theft protection and more.2

MetLife Auto & Home®: Auto Safety Features




        FAQs 
      




 What types of basic auto insurance coverage does MetLife Auto & Home offer?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Liability protection, which pays claims if you're responsible for an accident that causes bodily injuries and property damage.
Collision and comprehensive coverage, which pays for damage to your car if it hit another vehicle or object, no matter who caused the accident.4 It also pays for damage to your car caused by events like theft, vandalism, fire, flood, and hail.
Personal injury protection, which covers the costs of doctors, hospitals, and funeral expenses for you, members of your household, and/or your passengers, if a covered accident occurs, no matter who was at fault. You'll also be protected when you drive another person's car (with permission) or if a vehicle hits you or a family member as pedestrians.4
Uninsured motorists coverage, which pays the cost of damages and injuries resulting from being hit by an uninsured or hit-and-run driver. Coverage for both you and your passengers includes medical expenses, lost wages, and other injury-related losses.4
Underinsured motorists coverage, which pays for damages if you're injured in an accident caused by someone who doesn't have enough insurance to cover your medical expenses.





What other types of coverage are available?








MetLife Auto & Home® offers a wide variety of coverage options, including:

Rental car coverage. This will pay costs to the rental agency if you have an accident driving a rental car.
New car replacement. If you total your new car within one year of purchase or during the first 15,000 miles—whichever comes first—you get it repaired or it will be replaced with a new car with no deduction for depreciation.5
Special parts replacement. We'll pay to replace certain major parts—like tire, brakes and batteries--no matter what their wear-and-tear/depreciated value at the time of the accident.6
Glass repairs without a deductible. If your windshield is chipped or cracked, we'll repair it and waive your deductible.
Towing and roadside assistance and labor cost coverage. If your car breaks down while traveling, this can help reimburse you for towing and other roadside-assistance expenses.
Legal defense costs. If you're sued, we'll cover your legal fees. We'll also reimburse you for up to $200 per day for lost wages, if you attend a hearing or trial at our request.
Lease/loan gap coverage. Your vehicle's lease or loan will be paid off if your vehicle is a total loss due to an accident, even if the amount exceeds the value of your vehicle.





 What types of car insurance discounts and rewards does MetLife Auto & Home offer?









Deductible Savings Benefit. Automatically earn $50 every year you don't make a claim (to a maximum of $250) that may be used toward your deductible, if you have a covered loss.1
Defensive Driver Discount. Earn up to a 7% discount by completing a qualifying driver training course, like the one on the National Safety Council website.7
Superior Driver Discounts and MetRewards. Earn up to a 12% Superior Driver Discount if all of the drivers in your household have outstanding driving records, or up to 20% off your policy through the MetRewards program, if you are claim and violation-free for 5 years.8
Bundle and save. Save up to 10% with our multi-product and multi-policy discounts for having home as well as auto insurance with us. Check out our Bundle and Save page for more details! Sample multi-policy discounts:
          
Auto/Home multi-policy discount: 10%
Auto/Life multi-policy discount: 5% 9
 
Good Student Discount. Your star high school or college student could earn you a 15% discount if he or she qualifies.





 If I have a group policy, what happens if I retire, go on leave or change companies?








No worries! Your policy and coverage will continue without interruption, subject to policy terms and conditions. You'd be able to pay your insurance premiums through our EFT payment plan, by credit or debit card, through bills received by mail, or, in some cases, by pension deduction. If your premium is currently deducted from your paycheck and you go on short-term disability, like parental leave, your coverage stays in effect throughout your leave (subject to policy terms). If you were on payroll deduction and you're not receiving a regular paycheck from your employer, you'll receive a bill directly by mail.10




 What's the process for reporting an accident and filing a claim?








To file a claim with MetLife Auto & Home, call 1-800-854-6011—we're open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If you need to file a claim against another driver, you'll need to contact that person's insurance company or agent and give the other company your insurance information. If you purchased collision coverage, you won't have to wait for the other driver to pay for damages: we will pay for damage to your car minus your deductible, regardless of who is at fault. Depending on the claim, you may be assigned a primary adjuster who conducts a thorough investigation of the accident, a field adjuster who appraises your car vehicle, a total loss specialist who finalizes the vehicle value, and a medical payments/personal injury protection adjuster who handles medical bills, like emergency room visits. If your repair shop finds additional damage that wasn't included in the original estimate, your repair shop will advise the appraiser, who will then write up a supplemental estimate that includes the additional damage. A second check is issued for the additional damage.         




My lienholder is showing up on the claim I've reported and/or the claim check. What should I do?








If you've paid off your auto loan but your lienholder is showing up on the claim reported, contact your primary claim adjuster right away. You will be asked to mail or fax a copy of your vehicle's title with the stamp indicating that the lien was discharged. The claim adjuster will forward the copy of the title to our service center, which will update your policy automatically. If you lease your vehicle or if you are still making loan payments, the leasing company or lienholder must be listed on the claim check. To cash the check, simply contact your lienholder's or leasing company's customer service department to find out how it will arrange to endorse the check. Once it has been endorsed, you may deposit it into your bank account.

What is life insurance and why do I need it?








A death in the family is not only emotionally devastating, it can also take a tremendous toll on the future financial security of a family. Suddenly, without the deceased’s income, paying the mortgage or providing for a child's college education may become much more difficult.   
Those who buy life insurance do so to help ensure their loved ones are taken care of financially. Life insurance is a promise by an insurance company to pay those who depend on you a sum of money upon your death. In return, you make periodic payments called premiums. Premiums can be based on factors such as age, gender, medical history and the dollar amount of the life insurance you purchase.
In the event of your passing, life insurance provides money directly to the individuals you select, your beneficiaries, who can use the money as they see fit, including:

Replacing lost income
Covering basic living expenses
Paying household debts, estate taxes and funeral expenses
Funding a child’s education
Supplementing retirement savings





What kinds of life insurance can I get at work?








Life insurance comes in two main types – term and permanent – which may both be available through your workplace.
Term life insurance pays a specific lump sum to your loved ones for a specified period of time – usually from one to 20 years. If you stop paying premiums, the insurance stops. Term policies pay benefits if you die during the period covered by the policy, but they do not build cash value. They may also give you the option to port. That is, you can take the coverage with you if you leave your company.
Generally, you should consider a term life insurance policy to:

Get valuable coverage at an affordable price
Help cover specific financial responsibilities like a mortgage or college expenses
Supplement a permanent policy

 Permanent life insurance policies do not expire. They are intended to protect your loved ones permanently, as long as you pay your premiums. Some permanent life insurance policies accumulate cash value. That means, the value of the policy will grow each year, tax-deferred, until it matches the face value of the policy. The cash can generally be accessed via loans or withdrawals, and can be used for a variety of purposes. This type of plan is typically portable so coverage can continue if employment terminates. 
Consider a permanent insurance policy if you want:

Protection for life
Payments that stay the same each year
To put additional money into the policy on a tax-favored basis
Cash value you can use while you are living





What are the advantages of purchasing life insurance through work?








Getting life insurance through work can be an easy way to protect your family. If your employer offers a group plan, consider signing up for advantages that may include:

Competitive group rates
Guaranteed issue, meaning you can get a certain amount of coverage without answering health questions or taking a medical exam
Convenient payroll deductions
Easy access to enrollment and educational tools that can help you make the right decisions about the type and amount of insurance that’s right for you
The confidence of knowing that your employer has reviewed and selected the plan

 All you have to do is sign up, and sometimes enrollment is automatic.




How much life insurance do I need?








While you won’t be able to pinpoint the amount you’ll need to the penny, you can make a sound estimate.  Your goal should be to develop a life insurance plan that, following your death, will allow your family to live comfortably without your economic contribution. Also consider the effect of inflation over time. The amount needed for retirement or college 20 years from now is likely to be significantly higher than today.
To estimate the amount of life insurance your family would need, first calculate everything you now provide for your family including:

Salary
Benefits/health insurance
401(k) and retirement savings
Personal services you perform for your family, such as child care, cooking, home maintenance, etc.

 Then, subtract your personal expenses including:

Annual spending on personal needs, such as food, clothing, entertainment, etc.





How much does life insurance cost?








Life insurance through your workplace may be more affordable than you think. In fact, many people can get term life insurance coverage from a quality company for a surprisingly low price.1
Premiums are typically based on factors such as:

Age, sex, height and weight
Health status, including whether or not you smoke
Participation in high-risk occupations

 Life insurance gets more expensive as you get older, and the type of coverage you choose will also affect your premium. Rates for term insurance are typically lower, while rates for permanent policies are typically higher.




Does MetLife offer an individual one year term life insurance product?








Yes.  MetLife’s one year term products offer affordable protection when you require insurance for the short term. These products are designed to provide the right amount of protection when it’s needed most, or to supplement a policy you already have. Premium rates can be found here. For more information contact MetLife's Specialized Benefit Resources at 877-638-3932, and press 2 for New Business.




What are the tax advantages of life insurance?








Death benefits are generally received income tax-free by your beneficiaries. In the case of permanent life insurance policies, cash values accumulate on an income tax-deferred basis. That means you would not have to pay income tax on any of the policy’s earnings as long as the policy remains in effect. In addition, most policy loans and withdrawals are not taxable (although withdrawals and loans will reduce the cash value and death benefit).2

Under new structure, fewer MetLife advisers pushed to produce more
Restructuring puts two B-Ds under one roof, ups pressure to sell proprietary products

MetLife Inc. is revamping its distribution group, giving its two remaining broker-dealers higher required minimum production levels with the expectations of selling more proprietary products with fewer reps.The insurer is placing MetLife Securities Inc., New England Securities Inc. and MetLife Resources, a retirement services distributor, under a new banner called The MetLife Premier Client Group. As part of the restructuring, the firm will further cut its adviser corps by 300 to 600 reps after eliminating about 2,300 since last year.
				



(See also: MetLife adviser ranks thinning out fast after cuts)“The goal for the end of 2015 is about 4,700 to 5,000 advisers with an average of $185,000 in production,” said Paul LaPiana, senior vice president of MetLife Premier Client Group.In 2012, MetLife had 7,600 advisers with an average production of $127,000 per rep. Today, that number is down to 5,300, with an average of $165,000 in production for each adviser. Advisers under the new structure will be expected to meet higher sales minimums. Last year, brokers needed to generate $60,000 in production to make their minimum. That number is now $90,000 — and of that, at least $60,000 must come from proprietary products, whether MetLife's asset management platform or the sale of disability, annuity or life insurance products. “If someone doesn't have the $90,000, but they've made $75,000 in proprietary product sales, we'll allow them to make the minimum production requirement,” Mr. LaPiana said.The requirement on proprietary product sales goes against the grain, noted Jonathan Henschen, a recruiter with Henschen & Associates LLC. “The whole direction of the industry is the opposite of that: Make everything available to the rep and leave it to them what to sell,” he said. “In the captive market, many have opened up on things like mutual funds, so you have multiple fund families available. But for insurance, many of the companies are still restrictive.”Mr. Henschen added that the $90,000 production minimum is a high hurdle for many of the brokers. “A lot of those captive reps are in the $50,000 to $100,000 range, so this will force out a lot of them,” he said.Overall, the revamp is supposed to result in an elite adviser force that's inclined more toward comprehensive financial planning rather than just selling products. Mr. LaPiana said the firms are adopting a client engagement model that is “similar to what you see with a [certified financial planner] framework.”“It's a focus on training and education,” Mr. LaPiana said. “In the past, the top advisers have always been a process-driven holistic planning group. They take clients through a thoughtful dialogue, understand their objectives, help them accumulate for retirement and address risk management needs.”He added: “We find that a lot of our advisers at the lower tiers were going at it from a product perspective, rather than a comprehensive planning approach.” In addition to that higher training standard, MetLife wants more from its new recruits. In the past, the firm would recruit “a couple thousand [inexperienced representatives] in a year” and 100 who were experienced, Mr. LaPiana said. From this point on, the firm hopes to attract 700 to 750 inexperienced brokers, and 250 to 300 veteran reps. New advisers will be expected to work on teams and have access to guidance, mentorship and client prospects from the more experienced advisers.Recruits will be required to get their Series 7 and 65 licenses, as opposed to only their Series 6, 63 and life and health insurance licenses, Mr. LaPiana said.Mr. Henschen noted that the additional licensing is what gives wirehouse reps an edge over insurance brokers. Many reps at insurance firms tend to only be Series 6 licensed, he added. “MetLife will have its work cut out for them,” Mr. Henschen said. “This is going to be a long road.”MetLife has been through interesting times: In May, InvestmentNews reported that the insurer had cut its adviser force by about 2,500 reps in the past year — excluding the 850 brokers at Walnut Street Securities and Tower Square Securities, the two MetLife independent broker-dealers that were sold to Cetera Financial Group in April.

METLIFE INVESTMENT ADVISORS COMPANY, LLC CODE OF ETHICS

MetLife Investment Advisors Company, LLC Code of Ethics
MetLife Investments Department 
Code of Ethics 
April 30, 2007 
Amended January 1, 2010   
1 


SECTION I 
METLIFE INVESTMENTS DEPARTMENT 
INSIDER TRADING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES   


1.)
Introduction  This Code
of Ethics sets forth the policies and procedures of MetLifes Investments Department (Investments or the Investments Department) regarding material nonpublic information and applies to transactions in accounts for which
the Investments Department has day-to-day investment management responsibility. This Code of Ethics also applies to personal securities transactions of all MetLife Investments Department Access Persons (as defined herein) who have access to material
nonpublic information either by virtue of their affiliation with the MetLife Investments Department, including the registered investment adviser subsidiaries, MetLife Investment Advisors Company, LLC (MLIAC) and Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company (MLIC), or by other means.   


2.)
Standard of Conduct 
Capitalized terms used herein, but not defined, take on the meaning set forth in the glossary attached hereto as
Appendix A  MetLife seeks to foster a reputation for integrity and professionalism. That reputation is a vital business
asset. The confidence and trust placed in us by investors and clients is something that is highly valued and must be protected. As a result, any activity which creates even the suspicion of misuse of material non-public information by Investments or
any Access Person, which gives rise to or appears to give rise to any breach of fiduciary duty owed to any client, which creates any actual or potential conflict of interest between any client and Investments (or any Access Persons) or even the
appearance of any conflict, must be avoided and is prohibited.  Court decisions and Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) rulings interpreting the federal securities laws make it unlawful for any person to purchase or sell securities on the basis of material nonpublic information, commonly known as insider trading. The Insider Trading and
Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (ITSFEA) requires all investment advisers and broker-dealers to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent insider trading. ITSFEA
also provides additional penalties for individuals who engage in insider trading as well as their employers, if such employers have failed to establish and enforce adequate procedures. In addition, the Investments Department prohibits certain
practices even though they may not be unlawful because MetLife considers them to be poor business practices or to reflect adversely on MetLifes reputation. 
 
2 


The Investments Department policy is: 
 


 
A.
An Access Person may not trade for his or her own account (a Personal Account), directly or indirectly, in Securities on the basis of material information
which is gained in the course of employment or which is gained by any other means and which has not been made known to the general public for at least forty-eight (48) hours. 
 


 
B.
An Access Person may not trade in Securities for or on behalf of an account owned, managed or controlled by Investments, (a Company Account) on the basis of
material information which is gained in the course of employment or which is gained by any other means and which has not been made known to the general public for at least forty-eight (48) hours. 
 


 
C.
An Access Person may not recommend to any person, either in connection with the Access Persons employment or otherwise, any transactions in any Securities on the
basis of material information, whether or not gained in the course of such Access Persons employment with MetLife or the Investments Department and which has not been made known to the general public for at least forty-eight (48) hours.
  


 
D.
An Access Person may not communicate material nonpublic information to any person except in furtherance of such Access Persons duties as an Associate of MetLife.
 The exact scope of what constitutes material nonpublic information is a continuously evolving area
of law. For purposes of this Code of Ethics, material nonpublic information should be deemed to be any information about an issuer which is nonpublic because it has not been disseminated in a manner which would cause it to be available
to investors generally, provided there is a substantial likelihood that the information would affect the market price for the securities or any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold
securities of the issuer.  Material nonpublic information about a company or its securities is likely to originate from someone
who is an insider. The concept of insider is very broad. The term includes certain officers, directors and employees of a company. A person can become a temporary insider if he or she enters into a special
confidential relationship in the conduct of a companys affairs and as a result is given access to information solely for the companys purposes. A temporary insider can include, among others, a companys outside counsel, outside
accountants, consultants, bank lending officers, and the employees of such organizations, as well as, in certain cases, secretaries, administrative or legal 
 
3 



assistants, messengers and printers. In addition, the Investments Department itself may become a temporary insider of a company with which it has a business relationship or for which it performs
other services. In these situations, the company expects the Investments Department and its Access Persons to keep nonpublic information confidential. In addition, a person who receives material nonpublic information from an insider (a
tippee), may assume the status of an insider with respect to the material nonpublic information received if the tippee knows or should know that this information has been provided in violation of the insiders duty to keep it
confidential.  Any benefit derived from the misuse of material nonpublic information does not have to be monetary, but can be a
reputational or goodwill benefit. For example, an insider who provides material nonpublic information to others in order to make it appear that he or she holds an important position may violate the law. In addition, for example, a parent who
provides material nonpublic information to a son or daughter who then purchases or sells securities may violate the prohibition on tipping. 
In addition to the general prohibitions against purchasing or selling securities while in possession of material nonpublic information,
and against disclosing such information to others who purchase or sell securities discussed above, there is a specific SEC rule concerning trading in connection with tender offers. This rule makes it unlawful to buy or sell securities while in
possession of material information relating to a tender offer, if the person buying or selling the securities knows or has reason to know that the information is nonpublic and has been acquired directly or indirectly from the person making or
planning to make the tender offer, from the target company, or from any officer, director, partner or employee or other person acting on behalf of either the bidder or the target company. The term tender offer generally refers to the
purchase of a significant amount of securities of a company at a price above the prevailing market price.  Information should
be presumed material if it relates to such matters as dividend increases or decreases, earnings and earnings estimates, changes in previously released earnings estimates, significant increases or decreases in orders for a companys
products, dispositions of subsidiaries or divisions, merger or acquisition proposals or agreements, changes in debt ratings, significant new products or discoveries, extraordinary borrowing, significant major litigation, liquidity problems,
extraordinary management developments, purchases or sales of substantial assets, actions by a company that may have an impact on the companys financial condition such as significant write-downs of assets, additions to reserves for bad debts or
contingent liabilities, recapitalizations, restructurings, spin offs, leveraged buy-outs, contract awards, new products, voluntary calls of debt or preferred stock, public offerings of debt or equity Securities, major price and marketing changes,
significant litigation, impending bankruptcy and investigations by government entities. Material information also includes similar major events that would be viewed as having materially altered the total mix of information available regarding a
company or the market for its Securities.   
4 


As a rule, information which is no longer timely or cannot otherwise be reasonably
anticipated to have any immediate market impact will lack materiality. Among the factors to be considered in determining whether information is actually material are the degree of its specificity, the extent to which it
differs from information previously disseminated publicly, and its reliability in view of its nature and the source and the circumstances under which it was received. 
Nonpublic information is information that has not been publicly disclosed. Information received about an issuer under circumstances which
indicate that it is not yet in general circulation in the market place may be deemed to be nonpublic information. As a rule, before determining that information is public, one should be able to point out some readily demonstrable fact to show that
the information has been disseminated to the public through, for example, Bloomberg, an SEC filing, a press conference or press release or after delivery of the information to a stock exchange, the Associated Press, The New York Times, The Wall
Street Journal or appropriate trade publications, including online communications. In certain situations, the insider may be required to know that the information has been publicly disseminated. One should wait for at least forty-eight
(48) hours, after the information has been disseminated to the public through such means, before trading for his or her Personal Account or a Company Account.   


3.)
Penalties for Insider Trading 
Civil and criminal penalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information are severe, both for individuals involved in
such unlawful conduct and their employers and other controlling persons. A person can be subject to some or all of the penalties below even if he or she does not personally benefit from the violation. Penalties include: 
 


 

 
 civil injunctions   


 

 
 treble damages   


 

 
 disgorgement of profits   


 

 
 jail sentences (up to 10 years) for each violation   


 

 
 fines for the person who committed the violation of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided, whether the person actually benefited or the
benefit accrued to a tippee of that person, and   


 

 
 fines for the employer or other controlling person (i.e., supervisors) of up to the greater of $1,000,000 or three times the amount of the
profit gained or loss avoided.  Events have shown how severe the penalties for insider trading can be and how
becoming involved in insider trading can result not only in such things as fines and/or the loss of a persons liberty, but can also destroy careers and families and cause public humiliation and disgrace. The late 1980s cases involving Ivan
Boesky, Dennis Levine and the more recent cases involving Martha Stewart or the Galleon Hedge Fund are good examples.   
5 


In addition, any violation of this Code of Ethics can be expected to result in sanctions by
MetLife, including, but not limited to, such disciplinary action as a warning, a reprimand, probation, suspension, demotion or dismissal of the persons involved, even if such violation does not also violate the law. 
 


4.)
Making a Determination 
Any question as to what constitutes material nonpublic information should be resolved in the most conservative fashion (i.e., that
the determination be made that the information in question is material nonpublic information) or the question should be referred to the Securities Investments Law Department and/or the Investments Ethics and Compliance Officer (the Investments
ECO) or his/her designee for a ruling.  Before trading for a Company Account or a Personal Account in the securities of a
company about which you may have potential inside information, ask yourself the following questions:  Is the information
material? Is this information that an investor would consider important in making an investment decision? Would this information substantially affect the market price of the securities if generally disclosed? 
And  Is the
information nonpublic? To whom has this information been provided? Has the information been effectively communicated to the marketplace by being published in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times or other publications of
general circulation, including online communications?  If, after consideration of the foregoing, you have any questions as to
whether the information is material and nonpublic, you should consult the Securities Investments Law Department and/or the Investments ECO.   


5.)
Procedures   


 
A.
Proper Course of Conduct for Those Who Possess Material Nonpublic Information 
 


 
1.
If you have determined that information in your possession may be material and nonpublic (a) you should not purchase or sell the affected Securities on behalf of
yourself or others, including purchases or sales for any Company Accounts or Personal Accounts, (b) you should notify the Securities Investments Law Department and/or the Investments ECO immediately and consult with either regarding the
appropriate course of action, and (c) you should refrain from discussing such information with any other person at MetLife or any of its Affiliates except in connection with your duties as an Associate. 
 
6 




 
2.
In addition, if the material nonpublic information was obtained in the course of your association with the Investments Department, you should: 
 


 
(i)
Identify the issuer or issuers of the securities about which such material nonpublic information relates and notify the Investments ECO that such issuer or issuers may
need to be placed on the MetLife Restricted Issuer List (the Restricted List) (see below). Since no one other than the Investments ECO maintains a complete and current restricted list, it is extremely important that the Investments ECO
be contacted in this regard.   


 
(ii)
Not communicate the material nonpublic information except to other Associates or agents of MetLife or its Affiliates who need to know about such information in
connection with work being performed on behalf of MetLife. When communicating material nonpublic information is necessary, you should inform the recipient of the confidential nature of such information and notify the Investments ECO of the identity
of the recipients.  Access to material nonpublic information must be restricted. For example, files containing
such information should be securely maintained in ones own office or placed in limited access files within the files of ones unit or department, and access to computer files containing such information must be restricted or especially
coded to prevent and detect any improper use of such material.   


 
3.
 As long as the information you possess remains material and nonpublic, you must comply with the provisions outlined in this Code of Ethics. Thereafter,
(i) to the extent an issuers name was placed on the Restricted List or the Watch List (see below), you should notify the Investments ECO that removal of such issuer may be appropriate and, (ii) you will be free to trade on and
communicate the relevant information (subject to any other applicable restrictions contained elsewhere in this Code of Ethics) after being advised by the Investments ECO that such issuer has been removed from the Restricted List or Watch List. Those
persons with access to the Restricted List and/or Watch List will be notified of the removal of any issuers from such lists. Please note that it is as important for you to notify the Investments ECO when
  
7 




 

an issuer should be deleted from the Restricted List or Watch List as it is to notify the Investments ECO when an issuer needs to be added to the Restricted List or Watch List.
  


 
4.
When obtaining information outside the course of employment  When you acquire material nonpublic information outside the course of your employment you should not
disclose this information to anyone at MetLife, including your Unit Head manager or the Investments ECO. Consequently, the name of the issuer will not be placed on the Restricted List. Nevertheless, you are still prohibited from buying or selling,
on behalf of a Company Account or Personal Account, any Security issued by such issuers, and from making any investment recommendations to advisory clients on the basis of such material nonpublic information. 
 


 
B.
Restricted Issuer Lists  In
order to comply with the federal securities laws and to detect and prevent both the misuse of material nonpublic information as well as the appearance of impropriety in connection with securities transactions, the Investments ECO maintains two
confidential Restricted Lists containing the names of companies about which MetLife or its Affiliates or any of their Associates possess material nonpublic information. One list contains the names of all companies about whom MetLife has material
nonpublic information and that issue Securities that are either public, about to become public or 144A Securities. The second list contains the names of companies about whom MetLife has material nonpublic information and that do not have a class of
publicly issued securities. These Restricted Lists identify issuers that are subject to certain trading restrictions.  An
issuer may be placed on the Restricted List on any occasion where, under the particular facts and circumstances, it is deemed necessary and appropriate to restrict trading in order to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information. The private
company list is used to ensure that MetLife does not have an informational advantage in connection with a purchase or sale of a private security in the secondary market. An issuers name is deleted from the Restricted List when, in the judgment
of the Investments ECO, MetLife or its Affiliates no longer possess material nonpublic information about the issuer or its securities. 
For the period during which an issuer is listed on the Restricted List, neither the Investments Department nor any of its Access Persons
may buy or sell, solicit trades in, or recommend a Security of that issuer.  The Investments ECO maintains a record of each
addition to or deletion from the Restricted List. This record reflects the date the Issuer was added to or deleted from the Restricted List and the name(s) of the person(s) responsible for the addition to or deletion from the Restricted List and a
brief summary of the reasons for the inclusion or deletion.   
8 


The Restricted List itself is confidential information and therefore should not be widely
distributed. Access to the Restricted List must be approved by the Investments ECO. Associates with access to the Restricted List should not share it with anyone who has not been approved by the Investments ECO. The Investments ECO will generally
only approve access to Associates who (1) trade in Securities that are likely to be on the Restricted List, (2) monitor compliance with the Restricted List and its policies and procedures, or (3) supervise these traders and monitors.
The Investments ECO will also assess whether the Associate has frequent or urgent need for access or it would be a significant inconvenience for the Associate to obtain the information from other sources. 
 


 
C.
Watch List  The Investments ECO
also maintains a Watch List for those issuers about which MetLife, its Affiliates or any of their Associates may, as a result of special relationships or otherwise, appear to be in the position of having sensitive information, even though no
employee actually has material nonpublic information. Thus, for example, the Investments ECO will list the issuer on whose board a MetLife Executive Group member sits. The Investments ECO will also place names of issuers with whom MetLife or its
Affiliates has contractually restricted itself from trading Securities above a certain threshold.  For the period during which an issuer is
listed on the Watch List, the Investments Department and its Access Persons are prohibited from buying or selling, soliciting trades in, or recommending a Security of that issuer. If an Access Person wishes to trade for a Company Account in the
Securities of any issuer whose name appears on the Watch List, such Access Person must first request a waiver from the Investments ECO. The Investments ECO will in turn check with the Executive Group member to determine if that person possesses
material nonpublic information with respect to the applicable Security and if that person does not, the Investments ECO may permit the Access Person to trade in the name for a limited period of time, on a case by case basis. Similarly, in the case
of self-imposed contractual trading restrictions, the Investments ECO will check the applicable contract to determine whether the purchase or sale desired by the Access Person fits within the contractual trading limitations and will advise the
Access Person accordingly.

SECTION II 
Personal Trading Policies and Procedures   


1.)
Introduction  MetLife has
several levels of reporting and monitoring with respect to personal securities transactions based on the nature of an Associates duties and responsibilities at MetLife and its Affiliates and the assessed likelihood of the Associate having
access to material nonpublic information in the course of his/her employment. This section sets forth the Personal Trading Policies and Procedures that apply to MetLife Investments Department Access Persons, as defined herein (together Access
Persons). Access Persons may be subject to other Codes of Ethics or personal trading policies and procedures and are required to comply with all such policies and procedures in addition to this Investments Department Code of Ethics.
 The Investments ECO will assist Access Persons in interpreting this Code of Ethics. All Access Persons should direct any
questions concerning any provision of this Code of Ethics to the Investments ECO.   


2.)
Access Person  The
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act) defines Access person as: any supervised person of the investment adviser who (a) has access to nonpublic information regarding any advisory clients
purchases or sales of securities, or nonpublic information regarding the portfolio holdings of any reportable fund or (b) is involved in making securities recommendations to advisory clients, or has access to such recommendations that are
nonpublic.  Each Investments Department Associate or non-Investments Department Associate, wherever such person may be located,
who is involved in the investment advisory activities of MLIAC or MLIC, or who has access to portfolio holdings information or recommendations as set forth above, shall be considered an Access Person. This includes any MetLife employee who has full
data access to the Charles River Trading System, IDEAS data warehouse, CAMRA or Murex. The Investments ECO will advise those persons who are considered Access Persons that they are subject to the following requirements. 
All Access Persons are required to pre-clear their Personal Securities transactions, file Quarterly Transaction Reports, Initial and
Annual Holdings Reports, and an annual certification of compliance with the Investments ECO. Access Persons are prohibited from participating in any initial public offering, are subject to a blackout period for certain transactions as described
below, and are prohibiting   
10 



from generating short swing profits on transactions in MetLife, Inc. as described below. Access Persons are not required to pre-clear but are required to report holdings and transactions in
exchange traded funds (ETFs), other closed-end funds and proprietary variable product holdings. Failure to file a required report within the time period provided or to adhere to any provision of this Code of Ethics will constitute a
violation of this Code of Ethics and will subject the violator to penalties, up to and including termination.   


 
A.
Pre-Clearance  MetLife employs
an on-line Personal Securities Trading System called Sungard Personal Trading Assistant (PTA) that permits each Access Person to obtain prompt advice as to whether the Access Person or a Family Member of the Access Person may purchase or
sell a Security. PTA compares all requested and actual personal purchases and sales of Securities by each Access Person and each Family Member of the Access Person with the Restricted List and all purchases and sales of Securities by MetLifes
Investments Department in order to assist the Investments ECO in assessing whether such personal purchases and sales may involve the Access Person or a Family Member in potential front-running, trading on the basis of material non-public
information, or other potential violations of laws, regulations or rules applicable to the purchase or sale of Securities. 
Each Access Person must request pre-clearance, before the Access Person or a Family Member of the Access Person purchases or sells a
Security (other than those set forth below under the caption Exemptions), either by using PTA or, if the Access Person is unable to use PTA, by contacting the Investments ECO by telephone, e-mail or writing. Any Access Person who is
included on the Corporate Secretarys Restricted Group List is subject to the pre-clearance of MetLife, Inc. stock by MetLifes Corporate Secretary and must first obtain pre-clearance of the MetLife stock from the Corporate Secretary
before submitting a request for pre-clearance through PTA. The Investments ECO will process and maintain records of all such requests. Telephone, e-mail or written requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis, and will be subject to the
availability of access to PTA. The Investments ECO will promptly respond to telephone, e-mail or written requests for pre-clearance only if the Access Person cannot access PTA. 
An Access Person or a Family Member of the Access Person may not purchase or sell a Security (other than those set forth below under the
caption Exemptions), unless the Access Person has first provided the following information, as applicable, and obtained pre-clearance from PTA or the Investments ECO, prior to directly or indirectly initiating, or in any way
participating in, the purchase or sale of such Security:   


 

 
 Name of issuer of the Security and a description of the Security (such as common or preferred stock or interest rate and maturity, class, tranche, type
or other designation), including CUSIP or other identifier, if applicable.   
11 




 

 
 Nature of transaction (such as a buy, sell, exercise, etc.). 
 


 

 
 Whether the transaction involves the purchase of an equity Security in an initial public offering. 
 


 

 
 Name of Security Fiduciary who will effect such purchase or sale. 
 


 

 
 Account Number.   


 

 
 Number of shares (or principal amount as to debt Securities). 
 


 

 
 If readily available, current price information of the Security. 
 


 

 
 Order type (such as market, limit or good until cancelled). 
Obtaining pre-clearance does not relieve an Access Person from complying with all provisions of this Code of Ethics, including, but not
limited to, (a) the prohibition against purchases or sales of Securities while in possession of material non-public information, and (b) the requirement that all purchases or sales must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and
rules, including, but not limited to, the prohibitions against front-running.  If the Access Person is not granted
pre-clearance by PTA, the Access Person may request a waiver from the Investments ECO. The Access Person may submit each such request through PTA, if able, or otherwise in writing to the Investments ECO, describing fully the basis for requesting
such waiver. The Investments ECO may grant or deny such waiver in his/her sole discretion.   


 
1.
Effective Date of Pre-Clearance 
In general, each pre-clearance of a purchase or sale is effective only for the business day on which the pre-clearance is
obtained. If pre-clearance is obtained after 3 p.m. it is effective until 4 p.m. of the following business day. If any purchase or sale approved by such pre-clearance is not executed within that period, the Access Person must obtain a new
pre-clearance before executing the transaction. However, a pre-clearance request for an open order (including, but not limited to, a limit order) is effective until the transaction subject thereto is completed. However, before making any change in
the terms of the order, the Access Person must obtain a new pre-clearance.   


 
2.
Approval of Pre-Clearance Request 
PTA or the Investments ECO will pre-clear purchases and sales of Securities that appear to (a) present no reasonable likelihood of
harm   
12 



to any Account, (b) not involve the use of material non-public information, and (c) not to violate any applicable law, regulation or rule. 
PTA will maintain a record of each request and its approval or disapproval, and PTA or the Investments ECO will notify the requesting
Access Person of each such approval or disapproval. For all requests made outside of PTA, the Investments ECO will confirm, in writing or by e-mail in a standard format, the approval or disapproval of each request. The Investments ECO will maintain
the original form, and will send a copy to the requesting Access Person.  Hardship Exemptions. In rare situations where
unique circumstances exist, hardship exemptions or exceptions may be granted, in the sole discretion of the Investments ECO. The Investments ECO will address such situations on a case-by-case basis. 
 


 
B.
Prohibitions and Restrictions   


 
1.
Blackout Period 
Any Access Person who knows or has reason to believe that MetLife Investments Department is purchasing, selling or
actively negotiating with respect to a particular Security or other investment in an issuer (or guarantor) (e.g., the provider of a letter of credit for an issuer) of Securities (the issuer) may not trade for his or her Personal
Account the equity Securities of that entity until five
(5) days1 after any such purchase or sale by
Investments without the approval of the Investments ECO.   


 
2.
Initial Public Offering  Access
Persons and Family Members of Access Persons may not acquire any Beneficial Ownership in any equity security in an initial public offering   


 
3.
Private Placements  In
considering a request for the purchase of a Security in a private placement, the Investments ECO will determine whether the private placement should be reserved for an Account, and whether the opportunity is being given to the Access Person because
of the Access Persons position with MetLife.     


1

 This five day black-out period does not apply to entities that have a total market capitalization of over $3 billion. 
 
13 


An Access Person who receives approval to invest in a private placement of a Security and
who, at a later date, anticipates participating in the investment decision process regarding the purchase of Securities of the issuer of that private placement on behalf of any Account must disclose to the Investments ECO the Access Persons
prior investment in the private placement before participating in the investment decision process.  The Investments ECO may
revoke a pre-clearance any time after it is granted and before the transaction is executed. The Investments ECO may deny or revoke the request for any reason.   


 
4.
Short-Term Trading  All
MetLife, Inc. securities must be held for a minimum period of 60 calendar days, unless received as part of a performance share grant. All Access Persons are prohibited from profiting from the purchase and sale (or sale and purchase) of the same or
equivalent MetLife Security within 60 calendar days. The 60 calendar days will be calculated from the date of the most recent transaction and does not include trade date. Any profit realized from a trade in violation of this provision shall be paid
to MetLife, who will, in turn, donate that amount to a charitable organization.  This provision does not apply to: 
Transactions in Securities that are exempt from the pre-clearance requirements as described in section II(E) 
below; or 
Transactions that are otherwise exempted from the pre-clearance and reporting requirements as described in Section II(D) below.
 The Investments ECO may, in his or her discretion, grant an exception to this prohibition for Access Persons whose Family
Members livelihood depends upon the ability to trade securities without regard to a minimum holding period.   


 
5.
Investment Clubs  Access
Persons and Family Members of Access Persons may not form or participate in an investment club, unless the Access Person obtains an approval from the Investments ECO. After receiving such approval, the Access Person must pre-clear each purchase or
sale of a Security by the investment club.   
14 




 
6.
MetLife  Access Persons may not
purchase Securities of MetLife, Inc. while in the possession of material non-public information. In addition, Access Persons who have been notified by the Corporate Secretarys office that they are part of the Restricted Group may
not purchase MetLife Securities during certain blackout periods, which occur before and after the announcement of quarterly earnings.   


 
C.
Reporting and Disclosure   


 
1.
Quarterly Transactions Report 
Each Access Person must report on a quarterly basis each purchase or sale of a Security made during the quarter in which the Access
Person or a Family Member of the Access Person has any direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership. As to all purchases and sales of Securities reported as provided in this Code of Ethics, PTA will generate a Quarterly Transaction Report due from each
Access Person. Each Access Person must sign (either electronically or manually), and deliver the Quarterly Transaction Report to the Investments ECO, whether or not the Access Person or Family Member made any reportable purchases or sales, within


 
 Read the provisions of this Code of Ethics.

17 




 
 
which an Access Person or a Family Member has Beneficial Ownership, if neither the Access Person nor the Family Member has any Control over such Securities because they are under the
Discretionary Account management of another person, and (a) the Access Person enters into a letter agreement with that person, in substantially the form set forth in Appendix C, at the later of the time that person obtains such Control or
becomes an Investments Department Access Person, and (b) the Access Person, during the month of January of each calendar year, enters into a similar letter agreement for the calendar year. 
 


 
E.
Special Treatment for Exchange Traded and other Closed-End Funds and Proprietary Variable Products 
Advisers Act rules specifically exclude from the reporting requirements shares issued by open-end funds other than reportable funds;
closed-end funds and exchange traded funds are not specifically excluded. While there is little risk that an Access Person will be able to benefit from the use of material non-public information while transacting in closed-end funds or exchange
traded funds, all Access Persons must report these holdings since they are reportable securities under the Advisers Act. While these transactions do not need to be pre-cleared, they must be reported on the quarterly transaction report and Annual
Holdings Report.  Advisers Act rules also exclude from the reporting requirements Shares issued by a unit investment
trust that are invested exclusively in one or more open-end funds, none of which are reportable funds. A reportable fund is any fund in which the adviser serves as investment adviser or any fund whose investment adviser or
principal underwriter controls the adviser, is controlled by the adviser or is under common control with the adviser. MLIAC acts as an investment adviser to the Metropolitan Series Fund (Met Series Fund) pursuant to subadvisory
agreements. When an individual purchases a proprietary variable product, that person is essentially purchasing shares in the separate account, which is a unit investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940
Act). The separate account then invests in one of the available open-end funds, depending upon the underlying portfolios the client has selected. The Met Series Fund is one of the available open-end funds on many of the proprietary variable
products issued by MetLife and its Affiliates. Since the Met Series Fund is a reportable fund, and the exclusion for shares issued by a unit investment trust is not available where one or more of the open-end funds is a reportable fund, MetLife
Investments Department must require Access Persons to report as required under the Advisers Act. Therefore, all Access Persons must report their holdings of proprietary variable products on their quarterly transaction reports and Annual Holdings
Reports.   
18 




 
F.
Special Treatment for MetLife, Inc. Stock and Options 
There are a number of ways in which an Access Person or Family Member may own MetLife stock or options, some of which must be pre-cleared
or otherwise reported in PTA.   


 

 
 Shares or options of MetLife that are acquired in the open market and are held in a brokerage account, in an account of a Family Member of an Access
Person, or a trust or another account for which an Access Person is deemed to be a beneficial owner MUST be pre-cleared through PTA.

Preventative Measures  The
Investments ECO will review all purchases and sales of Securities reported by each Access Person, and compare each transaction with the Restricted List and purchases and sales of Securities by the Accounts. He/she will investigate each alleged
violation of this Code of Ethics, and, as a part of that investigation, will allow the Access Person an opportunity to explain why the violation did or did not occur. If the Investments ECO concludes that an Access Person has violated any provision
of this Code of Ethics, the Investments ECO shall prepare a report of such violation including details of the investigation (Violation Report), and shall present the Violation Report to the Ethics Committee for evaluation and advice as
to the penalty to be imposed.   
19 


The penalties for violating these personal transaction policies and procedures vary in
severity depending upon the nature of the violation. At a minimum, the penalties shall be as follows:   


 

 

1st violation
  a written warning with the specific details of the violation provided to the Access Person by the individuals Planning Board member;   


 

 

2nd violation
  A $250.00 fine will be imposed as a deduction from the individuals year-end AVIP incentive award, and a written notice with the specifics of the violation will be provided to the individual by the individuals Planning Board
member with a copy to the individuals HR file;   


 

 

3rd +
 violation  Access Persons with ongoing and/or multiple violations will be referred to the Ethics Committee for further disciplinary action, including possible termination. 
In addition to the above, the Investments ECO may recommend to the Ethics Committee further steps that should be taken to address such
violation, including recommending to the Ethics Committee additional sanctions against the violator.  The Ethics Committee may
impose such sanctions as it deems appropriate, including issuing a letter of censure, recommending that the Access Persons performance rating and/or AVIP incentive award be further reduced, recommending that the Access Person be placed on
probation, suspended, demoted or terminated. In addition, if the Access Persons actions violate federal securities laws, MetLife may be required to report such violations to the SEC. The SEC may bring civil and criminal charges against the
Access Person. If convicted, a person may face:   


 

 
 a jail sentence (of up to 10 years) for each violation; 
 


 

 
 disgorgement of profits; and   


 

 
 fines of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided. 
In addition, MetLife may be subject to fines of up to the greater of $1,000,000 or three times the amount of the profit gained or loss
avoided for failing to properly supervise the Access Person.

 PTA will contain restrictions so that each Access Person may only access Information on PTA as to the Personal Accounts of each Access Person and

22 



group of Associates of MetLife on a temporary or permanent basis. In addition, failure by any Access Person to comply with any of the reporting requirements specifically imposed by this Code of
Ethics upon him or her, including the filing of false information, is considered a violation of the Code of Ethics and may subject the Access Person to sanctions including possible termination. 
B. Consultation 
Compliance with applicable laws and with the Investments Departments policies described in this Code of Ethics and MetLifes
Guide to Insider Trading or any other Investments or MetLife policy or procedure with respect to insider trading, is the responsibility of each person. Interpretative questions may arise, such as whether certain information is material or nonpublic,
