Positioned as a brand that believes in "creating happy travelers," yatra.com provides information, pricing, and booking capability for domestic Indian and international air travel, hotel bookings, holiday packages, and bus and railway reservations, all designed to make business and leisure travel easier and more affordable. Customers can access yatra.com from their desktop or mobile browsers, via Yatra's mobile applications, a 24x7 multi-language call center, and a countrywide network of Holiday Lounges and Yatra Travel Express store locations. Yatra customers booked more than 2.8 million air travel reservations and hotel stays with total transaction value worth more than $900 million (at current exchange rates) during their fiscal year ended March 2016, an increase of 25% from the prior year (at constant currency rates) with 74% of transactions coming from repeat clients who return to book more travel. "We are excited to partner with TRTL in a transaction that we believe will enable Yatra to continue its growth as a new public company," said Mr. Shringi. "This transaction gives us substantial additional resources to support our growth and the continued improvement of our integrated online and mobile platforms. We look forward to expanding our already extensive network of domestic and international partnerships with hotels, airlines, car services, and tour package promoters, as well as further strengthening our brand presence and technology platform." Nathan Leight, Chairman of the board of TRTL, said, "We created TRTL with the express purpose of partnering with a company that would benefit from a public listing, could utilize our cash resources for growth and generate long-term returns for our shareholders. Yatra has the broadest brand recognition of any online travel agent in India. The infrastructure required to compete in India as an online travel agent represents a significant barrier to market entry. With its high level of brand recognition, large hotel network, significant investment in technology, and deep management experience in this sector, we believe Yatra has created tremendous competitive advantages. Not only is India one of the fastest growing economies in the world, business and leisure travel are among the fastest growing parts of its economy. Adding to that India's tremendous socio-economic trends toward urbanization and the rapid adoption of e-commerce and smartphone use by a population with increasing amounts of disposable income, we are excited about Yatra's prospects. We believe our combination will provide substantial new resources to position the company for accelerated future growth." Yatra's current key investors include leading U.S. and Indian venture capital firms and Indian strategic investors. This group will continue to own approximately a third or more of Yatra upon the consummation of the business combination. Promod Haque, Senior Managing Partner at Norwest Venture Partners, said, "We are delighted to have TRTL on board in combination with Yatra. This transaction will provide Yatra with significant resources to further strengthen its presence as one of the leading players in the fast growing Indian online travel market. We believe that the online travel market in India has a long runway of future growth with the key drivers of increasing prosperity, smartphone penetration and internet access across broad sections of the population. With its strong brand awareness and robust technology platform, Yatra is perfectly positioned to leverage the additional resources from this transaction to grow the business at an even faster pace going forward." Summary of TransactionTRTL raised $212.75 million in its IPO which is now held in a trust account. MIHI LLC, an affiliate of Macquarie Capital ("MIHI") has committed to purchase an additional $20 million of TRTL equity as part of the transaction. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, it is estimated that the current shareholders of Yatra will continue to own at least 35% of the issued and outstanding shares in the combined company. The first $100 million of cash (including MIHI's $20 million forward purchase) will be allocated entirely to the combined company's balance sheet and to pay transaction expenses. Any amount greater than $100 million available from TRTL will then be allocated 80% to current Yatra shareholders and 20% as cash to the combined company's balance sheet. Cash payments to current Yatra shareholders will be capped at $80 million. In addition, existing shareholders of Yatra may receive additional consideration of up to $35 million upon the achievement of certain financial objectives during the 18 months after closing. In order to facilitate the transaction, TRTL's sponsors have agreed to reduce by half the number of founder shares that they would have otherwise had at closing and MIHI has agreed commensurately to reduce the amount of its forward purchase of TRTL shares, made at the time of TRTL's initial public offering, from $40 million to $20 million. The boards of directors of both TRTL and Yatra have approved the proposed transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected in October 2016, is subject to approval by TRTL stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. is acting as TRTL's capital markets advisor. Greenberg Traurig, LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP are representing TRTL. Goodwin Procter LLP is representing Yatra. The description of the business combination contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the reference to the definitive agreements relating to the transaction, copies of which will be filed by TRTL with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as exhibits to a Current Report on Form 8-K.

NEW YORK and GURGAON, India, Dec. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:   TRTL, TRTLU, TRTLW, "TRTL") today announced that it completed its business combination with Yatra Online, Inc. ("Yatra"), a rapidly growing, India-based online travel agent.  The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and was approved by a vote of TRTL's shareholders on December 12, 2016.  With the closing of the transaction, TRTL has become a partially owned subsidiary of Yatra and all shares of TRTL Class A Common Stock will be automatically exchanged for Yatra's ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis and all warrants to purchase shares of TRTL Class A Common Stock will automatically become warrants to purchase Yatra's ordinary shares on the same terms. Yatra's ordinary shares will be traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "YTRA" beginning Monday, December 19, 2016 and Yatra expects its warrants will be traded on the OTCQX market under the symbol "YTRAW" in the near future.








Yatra is one of the fastest growing consumer travel platforms and the second largest online travel agency in India, one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Founded in 2006 by venture capital firms and experienced travel industry and technology executives, Yatra is a leading consolidator of travel products. Yatra has India's largest hotel network of 61,000 hotels.

Dhruv Shringi, Yatra's co-founder and chief executive officer, said, "It's a matter of great pride for us to be one of the few Indian companies to be listed on NASDAQ. Over the course of the past decade, Yatra has established itself as one of the leading brands and companies in the Indian Internet and e-commerce space. We are thankful to our shareholders, customers and patrons for supporting us and helping us achieve this milestone. The additional capital raised through this transaction will be used by us to further accelerate our growth, invest in mobile technology, and expand our multi-channel distribution network. With a well-established brand, a large and loyal customer base, and a strong balance sheet, we are a strong force to be reckoned with in the Indian travel market." 
Nathan Leight, chairman of Terrapin 3 Acquisition Corporation, said, "We are truly delighted to align our shareholders' interests with Yatra's accomplished team of management and distinguished venture and strategic investors.  Dhruv Shringi and his team founded and created a company that millions of customers trust and return to for a wide range of travel services and experiences.  We believe Yatra is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued vibrant expansion of India, the world's fastest growing major economy, and the rapid adoption of e-commerce and mobile technology by India's flourishing consumer class."
Yatra received approximately $93 million in cash in connection with the business combination and related transactions.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    and advances from one of our sponsors, Apple Orange LLC, of $200,000 as     
    described in this prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of 
    this offering.                                                              

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%  
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, up to $6,475,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s 
    deferred commissions (or up to $7,446,250 if the underwriter’s              
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter 
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be   
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination   
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business   
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working        
    capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                            

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect    
    approximately $100,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the    
    funds held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This 
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.025% per annum based upon current    
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.            

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing. This amount does not include any investment banking fees which   
    may be payable upon consummation of a business combination. Macquarie       
    Capital has not yet been retained for a specific financial advisory,        
    underwriting, capital raising or other transaction and so we are not able to
    quantify the fees for any such engagement. No funds will be paid out of the 
    trust to fund any such fee payments and it is not expected that any fees    
    would be paid prior to the consummation of a business combination. The      
    actual amount of fees received will vary significantly based on the size of 
    any transaction and the extent to which other investment banks are involved.

(6) In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
    business combination, our sponsors, their respective affiliates or          
    designees, have committed $500,000 each, for an aggregate of $1,000,000, to 
    be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to investigating and        
    selecting a target business and other working capital requirements after    
    this offering and prior to our initial business combination.                

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $185,000,000 (or approximately $212,750,000 if
the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$6,475,000 (or up to $7,446,250 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account located in the United States and held at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based upon current interest rates, we expect the trust account to
generate approximately $100,000 of interest during the next 24 months. We will
not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes and to fund working
capital requirements, until the earlier of the completion of our initial 
business combination or the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are 
unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of 
this offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on current interest 
rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be 
sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsors, members of our management team or
their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds
to, or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay Terrapin Partners, LLC, an affiliate of our Terrapin sponsor a total of
$10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, Apple Orange LLC, one of our sponsors,
has loaned and advanced us $200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at
the earlier of September 30, 2014 or the closing of this offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsors, their respective affiliates
or designees, have committed $500,000 each, for an aggregate of $1,000,000, to
be provided to us in the event that funds held outside of the trust are
insufficient to fund our expenses relating to investigating and selecting a
target business and other working capital requirements after this offering and
prior to our initial business combination and may, but are not obligated to,
loan us additional funds to fund our expenses relating to investigating and
completing our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the initial
stockholders.

MIHI LLC, one of our sponsors and a subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited, or
Macquarie (ASX: MQG), has agreed to enter into a contingent forward purchase
contract with us to purchase, in a private placement for gross proceeds of
approximately $40,000,000 to occur concurrently with the consummation of our
initial business combination, 4,000,000 of our units on substantially the same
terms as the sale of units in this offering at $10.00 per unit, and 1,000,000
shares of Class F common stock on the same terms as the sale of shares of Class
F common stock to our sponsors prior to this offering. The funds from the sale
of units will be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial
business combination; any excess funds from this private placement of units will
be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. This commitment is
independent of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their shares
and provides us with a minimum funding level for the initial business
combination. The contingent forward purchase contract is contingent upon, among
other things, our Macquarie sponsor approving the business combination, which
approval can be withheld for any reason.

In addition, we have granted Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. a right of first
refusal for a period of 36 months from the closing of this offering to provide
certain financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services
for which they may receive fees.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our Class A common
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the
limitations described herein or the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described
herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements)
created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsors or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware
corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout


 this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any
potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our
behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any
potential business combination target.

We intend to focus our efforts on seeking an initial business combination with a
company that has an enterprise value of between $200 million and $1.25 billion,
although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be
considered. Following the initial business combination, our objective will be to
implement or support the acquired company’s operating strategies in order to
generate additional value for shareholders. General goals may include additional
acquisitions and operational improvements. Our efforts to identify a prospective
target business will not be limited to a particular industry.

We believe that private equity firms and others will find the opportunity to
enter into the initial business combination with us attractive for the following
reasons:

.   Track Record of Our Management Team. Nathan Leight has served as chairman  
    of two previous blank check companies that completed successful business   
    combinations. Mr. Leight served as chairman of Aldabra Acquisition         
    Corporation, or Aldabra 1, which completed a merger with affiliates of and 
    into Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation, or GLDD (NASDAQ: GLDD) in 2006.
    Mr. Leight later served as chairman, and Mr. Arora and Mr. Barudin served  
    as key members of the management team of Aldabra 2 Acquisition Corp. or    
    Aldabra 2, which completed a merger in 2008 with certain paper and         
    packaging businesses of Boise Cascade Company. The resulting company was   
    subsequently listed on the New York Stock Exchange as Boise, Inc. or Boise.
    Mr. Leight has been on the board of GLDD since 2006 and has served as      
    chairman of GLDD since 2011. He served as a member of the board of         
    directors of Boise for five years following the merger with Aldabra 2. Both
    GLDD and Boise assets were owned by private equity investors prior to these
    transactions. We believe private equity firms will view the consummation of
    the Aldabra 1 and Aldabra 2 mergers, and the subsequent management of those
    companies, as positive factors in considering whether to sell a portfolio  
    company to us.                                                             

.   Minimum Funding Available as a Result of the $40 Million MIHI LLC Private  
    Placement. Our Macquarie sponsor has agreed to enter into a contingent     
    forward purchase contract with us to purchase, in a private placement for  
    gross proceeds of approximately $40,000,000 to occur concurrently with the 
    consummation of our initial business combination, 4,000,000 of our units on
    substantially the same terms as the sale of units in this offering at      
    $10.00 per unit, and 1,000,000 shares of Class F common stock on the same  
    terms as the sale of shares of Class F common stock to our sponsors prior  
    to this offering. The funds from the sale of units will be used as part of 
    the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination; any  
    excess funds from this private placement will be used for working capital  
    in the post-transaction company. This commitment is independent of the     
    percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their public shares and      
    provides us with a minimum funding level for the initial business          
    combination.                                                               

The contingent forward purchase contract is subject to the following closing
conditions:

.   the representations and warranties made by us in the contingent forward    
    purchase contract shall be true and correct in all material respects;      

.   all covenants, agreements and conditions contained in the agreement shall  
    have been performed by us;                                                 

.   we have obtained all blue sky law permits and qualifications required by   
    any state for the offer and sale of the private placement securities; and  

.   MIHI has provided its consent to the business combination, which it can    
    withhold for any reason.                                                   

MIHI LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Capital, which, in turn, is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited, or Macquarie (ASX: MQG).
Macquarie is a global provider of financial, advisory, investment, and funds
management services. Macquarie’s main business focus is generating returns to
investors and shareholders by providing a diversified range of services to
clients. Macquarie acts on behalf of institutional, corporate, and retail
clients and counterparties around the world. Founded in 1969, Macquarie operates
in 65 office locations in 28 countries, employs approximately 13,900 people and
has assets under management of over $394 billion (as of March 31, 2014).

Macquarie Capital comprises Macquarie’s advisory, capital raising and principal
investing capabilities. The firm provides varied services to corporate,
financial sponsor and government clients involved in mergers and acquisitions,
debt and equity fund raising, corporate restructuring, project finance and
public private partnerships. In the US, Macquarie Capital has specialist sector
expertise and a comprehensive advisory and capital markets platform. Macquarie
Capital’s expertise spans a variety of industry sectors including:

.  Industrials;

.  Telecommunications, Media, Entertainment and Gaming;

.  Financial Institutions;

.  Real Estate;

.  Resources;

.  Infrastructure; and

.  Power, Utilities and Renewables.

We believe private equity firms and management teams will view the track record
of our management team and Macquarie Capital’s deal sourcing and execution
capabilities as a positive attribute contributing to our ability to identify
attractive acquisition opportunities, and structure and complete a successful
business combination.

With respect to the above transactions, past performance by Mr. Leight and
Macquarie is not a guarantee either of success with respect to any business
combination we may consummate or that we will be able to locate a suitable
candidate for our initial business combination.
