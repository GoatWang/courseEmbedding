Women's Outdoor Shoes and Clothing
When women get out and hit the road or mountain trails, they apply their own brand of strength, agility and natural athleticism to the challenges of the outdoors. The right gear can help you conquer many obstacles, whether you are a casual walker or a serious hiker. This is why the women's collection from Merrell includes all the right shoes and outdoor gear and apparel for maximum protection and comfort. In addition to footwear like women's hiking boots and shoes, Merrell has the right tees, tanks, pants, skirts, socks, insoles, beanies, and backpacks. Your gear does not necessarily define your outdoor lifestyle, but it can enhance your experience and make it much more enjoyable. You want to protect yourself from rain, wind and rugged terrain, and Merrell has the M Select™ technology to help strong women flourish in the outdoors. Moisture wicking fabric, M Select™ GRIP and GORE-TEX® are just a few examples of the amazing technologies that are built into Merrell outdoor gear.

A unique, more personal approach to investing: One that puts the interests of our clients first. 
 


We take a more personal approach to investing.
One focused on what's really important—your future.









Our purpose is to help you reach your goals at each stage of life
John Thiel














Why a Merrill Lynch Advisor?

Creating a financial strategy that reflects your personality. Getting to know you is your financial advisor's primary goal.



An approach built around your life's priorities. It's time for a financial strategy that puts your needs and priorities front and center.



Adapting the approach as life changes and goals are reached. It starts by being open and transparent about what we do. We'll explain the services you'll get, outcomes you may face and, just as importantly, what you'll pay. As things change, we'll be there to help you navigate with our industry leading insights.

Women's Outdoor Shoes and Clothing
When women get out and hit the road or mountain trails, they apply their own brand of strength, agility and natural athleticism to the challenges of the outdoors. The right gear can help you conquer many obstacles, whether you are a casual walker or a serious hiker. This is why the women's collection from Merrell includes all the right shoes and outdoor gear and apparel for maximum protection and comfort. In addition to footwear like women's hiking boots and shoes, Merrell has the right tees, tanks, pants, skirts, socks, insoles, beanies, and backpacks. Your gear does not necessarily define your outdoor lifestyle, but it can enhance your experience and make it much more enjoyable. You want to protect yourself from rain, wind and rugged terrain, and Merrell has the M Select™ technology to help strong women flourish in the outdoors. Moisture wicking fabric, M Select™ GRIP and GORE-TEX® are just a few examples of the amazing technologies that are built into Merrell outdoor gear. Women can accomplish great things in nature, and our gear can help. Enjoy the journey, but make sure the right gear from Merrell comes along.
