Thar Pharmaceuticals Inc. plans to go public in a $50 million offering, according to a filing the company made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Based in O’Hara Township, Thar spun out of Thar Technologies in 2007. The company plans to trade on Nasdaq using the ticker symbol THAR.




 


The clinical stage biopharmaceutical company develops oral versions of existing drugs that are only delivered to patients through an IV.




Thar’s lead product candidate is T121, a treatment for CRPS, short for complex regional pain syndrome, a disorder characterized by loss of motor function, changes in skin color and texture, bone demineralization and severe, debilitating pain.
"We intend to utilize the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to seek approval of T121 in the United States," the company noted in the filing. "Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes novel, oral therapies designed to solve clinical limitations of IV-only therapies for serious and life threatening conditions."

Reinventing Known, Safe Drugs


Thar Pharmaceutical’s lead product, T121, is an oral form of intravenous (IV)-only zoledronic acid. Zoledronic acid (ZA), marketed as Zometa® by Novartis, is a bisphosphonate drug compound used currently in the treatment of multiple myeloma, bone metastases and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Zoledronic Acid is also marketed by Novartis as Reclast® and used for the treatment of osteoporosis.
Thar has developed T121 using its Enhance™ technology platform. T121 has been granted orphan designation in complex regional pain syndrome by the FDA and has been granted composition-of-matter protection IP protection until 2030 with extensions to 2035 pending. Thar is developing T121 in a Phase 3 program for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and has a very clear path from the regulatory agencies for its development.
T121 removes the requirement to deliver zoledronic acid through an IV. An oral version of zoledronic acid should improve patient convenience, compliance and comfort.
T109 is in preclinical development and is a fast-acting non-narcotic therapy for acute pain. Originally used for chronic pain, Thar has re-invented this drug for acute pain with targeted applications in back pain, post-operative pain and dysmenorrhea.
Thar Pharmaceuticals has additional IV-to-oral transformation programs ongoing for other cancer products and faster onset product opportunities in development for such indications as pain, erectile dysfunction, anxiety and migraines.
For the company’s own clinical development Thar Pharmaceuticals starts with already approved drugs with known safety, efficacy and market success in order to skip drug discovery and many of the high-risk steps in drug development. An expedited regulatory path may also be available for certain drugs and indications. Furthermore, our EnhanceTM Technology allows us to obtain new composition-of-matter patent life around our products.

CRPS - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Explained - Thar Pharmaceuticals





























































 
 















CRPS – Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Explained 



Learn about Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)What is CRPS?


CRPS is an orphan disease and is a chronic pain condition characterized by spontaneous and evoked regional pain, usually beginning in a distal extremity, which is disproportionate in magnitude and/or duration to the typical course of pain following a particular tissue injury or trauma.  It is distinguished from other chronic pain conditions by the presence of signs and symptoms indicating prominent autonomic and inflammatory changes in the area of pain.  Patients may present with a limb displaying extreme hyperalgesia and allodynia (i.e., normally non-painful stimuli such as touch or cold are experienced as painful); obvious changes in skin color, skin temperature, and sweating relative to the unaffected side; edema and altered patterns of hair, skin, or nail growth in the affected region; diminished strength; tremors; and dystonia (Harden et al., 1999). CRPS is often associated with significant impairments in activities of daily living and ability to function.
CRPS was formerly known by various names, “reflex sympathetic dystrophy” (RSD) and “causalgia” being the most common. Population studies indicate that CRPS is 3-4 times more common in females than males, more commonly affects the upper limbs, and peaks in incidence between 50 and 70 years of age. It is diagnosed solely based upon clinical signs and symptoms using internationally agreed-upon diagnostic criteria published by the IASP.


Treatment of CRPS


There are currently no FDA approved therapies for the treatment of CRPS. Oral opioids are often used to treat short-term pain, but generally have poor efficacy. Spinal cord stimulators are also sometimes used, but are highly invasive, expensive and only provide temporary relief. For severe pain, multiple sub-anesthetic infusions of ketamine may be used. There remains a very high unmet need for FDA-approved efficacious therapies to treat CRPS and its symptoms.

Improving the Patient ExperienceImproving the patient experience is an integral part of solving clinical limitations of existing drugs. Not only are there clinical or chemistry limitations of existing drugs such as low solubility or bio availability, but there are also challenges to patients such IV-only drugs with long, painful infusion periods over hours in a day. Thar Pharmaceuticals’ new oral versions of drugs can offer patients more convenience, comfort, activity and mobility than IV-only drugs. Oral drugs also save time and cost less, which benefits patients, insurance companies and healthcare companies.See Our Technology

News


Grünenthal has acquired US-based Thar Pharmaceuticals Inc. to expand its development portfolio of treatment options for CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome), a serious, disabling orphan disease

The acquisition supports Grünenthal’s commercial and R&D strategy to drive innovation in pain.
Thar Pharmaceutical’s lead compound, T121, complements Grünenthal’s existing development pipeline and the goal of delivering innovative and effective treatments to patients with CRPS.
Patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), an orphan disease, suffer from severe, persistent pain and a variety of other disabling symptoms.
There is a significant unmet medical need for those suffering from CRPS. Classic analgesics offer only limited symptomatic relief; there are no sufficiently effective treatment options available.
There are no FDA or EMA approved drug treatments for CRPS.

Aachen, Germany, and Pittsburgh, PA, USA – 16 November 2016 – Grünenthal, an R&D-driven, privately held international pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Germany, has announced its recent acquisition of Thar Pharmaceuticals, a US-based clinical-stage, specialty pharmaceutical company. Thar Pharmaceuticals focused on transforming IV-only drugs into oral drugs for existing and new indications using its proprietary technology EnhanceTM development platform. With this acquisition, Grünenthal has obtained the worldwide development and commercialization rights for Thar Pharmaceutical’s lead development candidate, T121.
T121 is a novel, Phase III-ready, composition-of-matter patented oral zoledronic acid drug product. It has received orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. T121 complements and broadens Grünenthal’s portfolio for CRPS, which includes IV neridronate that is currently in phase III clinical development.
Grünenthal will conduct clinical phase III development to demonstrate efficacy and safety of T121 for the treatment of patients with CRPS. Preclinical1 and pilot clinical2 evidence suggest that zoledronic acid could significantly reduce pain and other debilitating symptoms of CRPS.
“Grünenthal is highly dedicated to improving the life of patients with pain and orphan diseases that have limited treatment options”, said Gabriel Baertschi, CEO of the Grünenthal Group. “As global leader in pain, we strive to develop innovative, life-changing products. This acquisition fully supports our strategy to become a leading player in CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome).”
“We are expanding our development portfolio for treating patients with orphan, disabling diseases. For CRPS, an often debilitating, extremely painful syndrome, truly efficacious treatments are lacking today“, explained Dr. Klaus-Dieter Langner, Chief Scientific Officer of Grünenthal. “With the successful development of our expanded portfolio, oral T121 and IV neridronate, Grünenthal seeks to offer CRPS patients new hope for the future. Our teams are highly motivated and will use all of their knowledge, experience and resources to bring these promising treatments to market for patients as soon as possible.”
“We are very proud of what our team of employees, advisors, partners and investors has accomplished in driving our T121 lead product from an idea to the initiation of Phase 3 development for the treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,” stated the former Thar Pharmaceuticals board chairman, Dr. Lalit Chordia. Raymond K. Houck, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Thar Pharmaceuticals, added, “We believe Grünenthal is an exceptional strategic fit for Thar’s T121. Grünenthal combines world-leading knowledge and expertise in CRPS with the resources, motivation and dedication to successfully develop and commercialize our potential first-in-class, non-opioid oral treatment to improve the lives of CRPS patients. Grünenthal’s track record of bringing innovative pain treatments to patients around the globe underscores that we have chosen the right partner”.
Locust Walk acted as lead financial advisor to Thar on this transaction. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. served as co-financial advisor to Thar, and Goodwin Procter LLP served as its legal advisor.

TechnologyEnhanceTM Technology: A Platform for Solving Clinical Limitations



EnhanceTM Technology is a proprietary chemistry technology for solving clinical limitations such as bioavailability, safety, efficacy and stability. EnhanceTM Technology uses generally-recognized-as-safe (GRAS) compounds to improve drugs at the molecular level. These changes affect the drug’s physicochemical (solubility, permeability, melting point, etc.) and pharmacokinetic (bioavailability, onset, and absorption) properties. Although the pharmacokinetics of the drug are changed, neither the pharmacology nor the pharmacodynamics of the drug are changed. There is no change to the basic drug-protein target interaction. From the perspective of pharmacokinetics, EnhanceTM Technology impacts absorption but does not change distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug.









EnhanceTM Technology Can Solve Clinical Limitations By:



Changing the route of delivery from IV-only to oral administration

Eliminates cost of administration and increases patient convenience


Reducing IV, IM or SC suspension and reconstitution problems







Reducing PK variability
Improving safety, reduced side effects and toxicity
Reducing polymorphic proliferation, improving stability
Increasing speed of onset of action:

Expands patient population by repositioning chronic drugs for acute uses









Managing product lifecycle:

New composition-of-matter IP
Cost-effective and time-efficient regulatory approach with 505(b)(2) filings

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Funding stage comparison
employee comparison












Estimated website visits
This graph shows estimated monthly visits to the company website. As our data source puts it, "a visit is defined as an entry to a web domain from a different web domain or from the beginning of an empty browsing session, and expires after 30 minutes of inactivity."


Ok, thanks






















Funding stage comparison
This graph gives a simple snapshot of a startup's evolutionary position among its competitors. To determine a company's development stage, we count the number of funding rounds and the amount of capital raised. We then approximate and visualise a company's value -- the bigger its circle, the more valuable the company.
Why does it matter?
The size and number of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed. Investors use this basic data to take the pulse of a startup among its competitors that aim for the same market. Several funding rounds and sizable investments are a good gauge of current investors' confidence in the market, the business, and the team.
Ideally, you'll want to see the startup developing from the lower left corner of the graph to the top right. This would signify a gradual rise in both funding and value. Anomalies, such as multiple small funding rounds, or few very large funding rounds, also warrant closer inspection.


Ok, thanks










Value, Funderbeam estimate, $m
















Employee comparison
This graph shows staff growth over time. If an older company’s balloon still lingers low, its employee growth has stalled.
                            Larger balloons indicate that hiring has likely been fuelled by investors' cash, smaller balloons high in the graph hint at revenue-driven staff growth.


Ok, thanks

valuation
relative funding history
funding history











Disclosed funding
This build-up graph gives an overview of disclosed funding rounds in chronological order, indicating the time and type of funding raised.
Why does it matter?
The size and frequency of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed. Experienced investors look at the size, number and timing of funding rounds in a given industry, and estimate the value of a startup,
                            as well as the amount of equity that founders have likely surrendered. Funding reflects investor confidence in the market, the business, and the team.


Ok, thanks












 








Valuation, Funderbeam estimate
This graph shows a given startup's valuation at different disclosed funding rounds. We approximate the post-money valuation by estimating the value range of the equity stake that the startup may have surrendered to investors in each disclosed funding round.
Why does it matter?
Investors usually want to avoid overpaying for an equity stake in a startup. Comparing startup valuations in the same industry segment helps you read the mood and maturity of the market, investors' exit potential, etc. It also helps you see if a startup prices itself above or below its competitors, considering its product, development stage, etc.
A startup's precise value is impossible to estimate, partly because parties rarely disclose the percentage of the company that's surrendered to investors in any given funding round. However, we can estimate a likely value range based on how startup investments usually work.


Ok, thanks












 








Relative funding history
This graph gives competitors a common starting point, making it easier to view their speed of growth in relation to one another.


Ok, thanks






















Funding history
This graph makes it easy to see and compare the pace of funding among competitors. As a rule, later rounds mean that a company's business model works. This helps to gauge when business in a given sector really took off.


Ok, thanks
