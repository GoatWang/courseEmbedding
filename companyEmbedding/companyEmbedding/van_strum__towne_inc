Van Strum & Towne


















 

 


FIRM BACKGROUND
Van Strum & Towne was originally founded in 1927 by Kenneth S. Van 
        Strum and Herbert S. Towne. Kenneth Van Strum was one of the first  
        members of the investment community to recognize that ownership of  
        common stocks could be a valuable means of preserving purchasing  
        power. He published the book “Investing in Purchasing Power” in 1925 
        and was the originator of “The Trader” column in Barron’s Weekly. The 
         more than seventy-five years of the firm’s investment counseling
        experience has spanned both adverse and prosperous times – and we 
        have weathered exposure to extremes in financial market confidence.
Van Strum & Towne is an independent investment management firm; it has no brokerage, banking or underwriting affiliations. Ownership is 
        vested with the firm’s officers and directors, and income is derived solely 
         from fees for investment management services.

DECISION MAKING PROCESS
THE INVESTMENT POLICY COMMITTEE
The decision making process is controlled by our Investment Policy Committee, made up of all the firm’s senior investment officers. The Committee, which meets weekly, analyzes pertinent macroeconomic, monetary, and political developments that have an overall effect on securities markets.
The Committee also focuses on individual industries and companies. Based on their research, recommendations are made by Committee members for approval of individual securities, which, in our judgment, offer the opportunity for long-term capital appreciation.
RESEARCH CAPABILITIES
Each portfolio manager is assigned responsibility for particular industries and keeps abreast of all research in this area using trade journals and periodicals, corporate annual reports, SEC filings and research produced by leading Wall Street firms. Based on this research, each portfolio manager recommends to the Committee those companies and industry sectors he or she considers attractive for purchase or sale.
THE “BUY LIST”
Through our decision making process common stocks are recommended and discussed, then either approved or disapproved by the Investment Committee for inclusion on our approved or “buy list”. The same process is used both in deleting a security from the list and in adding a name to it. This list reflects our current thinking and is composed of approximately fifty companies. We review companies weekly and take into account price movement, new information, and attractiveness relative to the market. The final decision maker is the portfolio manager, who is responsible for implementing buy and sell decisions based on specific client objectives and circumstances.

 INVESTMENT STRATEGY & APPROACH
COMMON STOCKS
Our portfolio managers are responsible for implementing the firm’s overall investment strategy. They recommend the percentage of each portfolio to be committed to equities and alternative investments.
Our equity strategy aims at capital growth by emphasizing investment in quality companies with excellence in management, a faster rate of growth than the economy, and reliability in earnings growth rates. In short, we seek “quality growth” firms.
FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS
Fixed income securities are useful to clients with certain income needs and tax requirements. We emphasize high-quality issues including, U.S. government bonds, corporate bonds and municipal bonds. We do not sacrifice quality to capture unusually high yields.
CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Cash Equivalents holding sizeable quantities of short-term Treasury obligations and other money market instruments can shelter client portfolios from risk and provide buying reserves for the future. We emphasize credit quality and liquidity in the selection of cash equivalents.
ASSET ALLOCATION
Asset mix – the percentage levels allocated to cash, fixed income securities, and common stock – remains one of the most crucial elements of investment strategy. Our portfolio managers determine the asset allocation of each of their accounts, and they are constantly reviewing these ratios to be sure they reflect the clients’ objectives and tax considerations. Asset allocation is also discussed at our weekly Investment Policy Committee meetings.
