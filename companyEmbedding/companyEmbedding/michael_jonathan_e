Amazon.com Store Card


                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system.
