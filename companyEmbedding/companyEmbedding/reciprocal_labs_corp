Propeller Health Receives FDA Clearance for Propeller Platform in Association with GSK's Ellipta Inhaler
Nov 7 16
Propeller Health announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance to market its Propeller platform for use with GSK's Ellipta inhaler, the pharmaceutical company's innovative, patented, dry powder inhaler (DPI). The sensor for the Ellipta inhaler was built and cleared as part of a development agreement and R&D collaboration between Propeller and GSK that was announced on December 1, 2015. This FDA clearance follows CE Mark and Health Canada registration for the device and system earlier this year. The company is FDA-cleared to help patients and their physicians better understand asthma and COPD, and help to improve the symptoms and outcomes of these chronic respiratory diseases. With proprietary sensor technology, software, and services, Propeller's digitally-guided therapy platform integrates information from multiple sources, including connected medications, then uses machine intelligence to help individuals manage their condition. The company platform has been used by patients with asthma or COPD in over 45 commercial programs across the US, including major healthcare systems, payers, employers and other commercial partners. This clearance marks the eighth FDA clearance, as well as the eighth international clearance, received by Propeller to date.


Vectura Group plc and Propeller Health Announce Collaboration to Develop Digitally-Connected Inhalers to Address Chronic Respiratory Diseases
May 24 16
Vectura Group plc and Propeller Health announced a collaboration to develop inhalers that combine Vectura's proven dry powder inhaler ("DPI") technology with Propeller's FDA-cleared digital health platform. The initial focus of the collaboration will be the development of an add-on sensor for Vectura's lever-operated multi-dose inhaler (LOMI). Patients with a Propeller-connected LOMI device will be more engaged with their care and better equipped to understand their disease and improve self-management. The LOMI device leverages key attributes from Vectura's GyroHaler® device: Familiar user interface; Foil blister strips of up to 60 pre-metered doses; Used blister strip within device; Key drug delivery components (especially drug contact components) sourced from GyroHaler®. The companies are also discussing additional connected strategies for other proprietary respiratory devices in Vectura's pipeline.

Testimonials





Carrie,
Asthma patient and Propeller user
“Asthma is a difficult disease, but with Propeller I have now had a few weeks without many symptoms and many days without any symptoms.”




Yvette,
Propeller user and caregiver
“My biggest 'wow' moment was getting a text message that my son used his inhaler.”




Katherine,
Propeller user and patient
“Asthma can make a lot of things in your life just a little more challenging.”
We all get busy and you can have a tendency to just deal with things being harder, but the weekly emails... helped remind me to take some time to check in with myself to see how I was doing and actually focus on making sure I'm managing my asthma as well as I can be.
