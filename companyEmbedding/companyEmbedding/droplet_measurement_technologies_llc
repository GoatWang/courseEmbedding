Particle Imaging 


Particle imaging technology is used to size and image larger water droplets. A laser illuminates the particle, which shadows elements in a photodiode array depending on the particle's size and shape. Information from the photodiode array is then relayed to the data analysis system.




Particle Light-Scattering 


Light-scattering is used to determine the size of smaller water droplets. A laser illuminates the particle, which scatters the light in all directions. This light is measured and used along with Mie theory to infer particle size. 




Polarization Detection 


Polarized light is used to determine particle phase. A laser illuminates the particle, polarized light measurements are recorded, and ratios of polarized to non-polarized light are used to infer phase. Polarization detection is available on certain probes, including the CDP and BCPD.




Supersaturation Generation 


DMT's nuclei counters work by generating supersaturated conditions (RH > 100%) inside the instrument. Nuclei are drawn into the instrument, and the supersaturation causes water vapor to condense around them. The resulting particles are then counted by an Optical Particle Counter, giving an estimate of nuclei in the inflow.




Fluorescence Detection 


Fluorescence detection is used to detect bioaerosols. Bioaerosols fluorescence, whereas non-organic aerosols do not. Measuring the amount of fluorescence emission thus provides an estimate of bioaerosol concentrations. 




Hotwire Sensing 


DMT's Liquid Water Content Sensor (LWC-300), designed for aircraft use, features hotwire-sensing technology. A wire is heated to a a specific temperature, and the energy required to maintain this temperature is used to infer liquid water concentration.
