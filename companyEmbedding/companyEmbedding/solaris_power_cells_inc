	NOTE
	1 – ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS




	 



	Solaris
	Power Cells, Inc. (formerly Rolling Technologies, Inc.) (“Solaris” and the “Company”) was incorporated
	in Nevada on July 27, 2007.



	 



	The
	Company is developing a renewable energy storage device to market to residential and commercial industrial users. Solaris currently
	has developed a prototype of our Solaris Power Cell.



	 




	NOTE
	2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Basis
	of Presentation




	 



	The
	accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Solaris Power Cells have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read
	in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 contained
	in the Company’s Form 10-K originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21, 2015. In the opinion
	of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position
	and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the
	interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements
	which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for years ended
	December 31, 2014 and 2013 as reported in the Company’s Form 10-K have been omitted.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates




	 



	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Property
	and equipment, net




	 



	Property
	and equipment are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives, 3 to 5 years, using the straight-line method of depreciation
	for book purposes. As of September 30, 2015, property and equipment consisted of the following:

	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded a depreciation expense of $8,005 and $8,947, respectively.




	 





	Recently
	Adopted Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	The
	Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and
	does not believe that there are any other new pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
	position or results of operations.





	 






	NOTE
	3 - GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and
	the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the financial statements, during the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,117,404, which included a deduction for derivative expenses of
	$444,001, consulting expense of $825,624 and as of the same date has an accumulated deficit of $5,765,656. If the Company is unable
	to generate profits and is unable to continue to obtain financing for its working capital requirements, it may have to curtail
	its business sharply or cease business altogether. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
	continue as a going concern.




	 




	The
	financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might
	be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.




	 




	The
	Company is taking certain steps to provide the necessary capital to continue its operations. These steps included, but are not
	limited to: 1) focus on sales to minimize the need for capital at this stage; 2) converting part of the outstanding accounts payable
	to equity; 3) raising equity financing; 4) continuous focus on reductions in cost where possible.

	NOTE
	4 –NOTES PAYABLE






	 





	The
	Company entered into a convertible note agreement on September 2, 2014 for $500,000. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company shall
	receive $450,000 against the $500,000 note, after the original issue discount of $50,000. The Maturity Date of the note is 2 years
	from the date of each advance. The Lender has the right, at any time after the advance, at its election, to convert all or part
	of the outstanding and unpaid principal sum and accrued interest (and any other fees) into shares of fully paid and non-assessable
	shares of common stock of the Company as per the conversion formula. The conversion price is the lesser of $0.26 or 60% of the
	lowest trade price in the 25 trading days previous to the conversion. If the Company does not repay on or before 90 days from
	the date of advance, a one-time interest charge of 12% shall be applied to the principal sum. The Lender advanced $50,000 at the
	closing of note. Pursuant to the terms of the note, the original issue discount amounted to $5,556. Since, the note did not have
	a conventional conversion feature and had a variable conversion price indexed to the market price, the conversion feature was
	separately valued and was recorded as a derivative liability. The Company issued 3,477,098 shares from March 5, 2015 to June 22,
	2015 for the full conversion of the note. The Company fully amortized the original issue discount of $5,556 and removed the related
	derivative liability of $114,143, on the conversion of the note.




	 




	On
	February 25, 2015, the lender advanced another $30,000 against the same note. The Company recorded an interest and original issue
	discount of $7,333 which is being amortized over the term of the note of 2 years from the date of advance. The Company calculated
	an initial derivative liability on the note of $211,197. Of this value, $30,000 was recorded as debt discount and is being amortized
	over the term of the note. The balance amount of $181,197 was recorded as derivative liability. This derivative liability was
	revalued and on September 30, 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability was $36,242. The change in derivative liability
	was charged to the income statement. During the three months period ended September 30, 2015, the note holder converted partial
	note. The Company issued 3,000,000 shares to the note holder for conversion of $11,500 of the total note. This note conversion
	reduced the derivative liability by $26,493. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company amortized $8,918 of
	debt discount and $2,180 of the original issue discount and interest.




	 




	On
	June 24, 2015, the same lender advanced an additional $50,000 against the note. The Company recorded an interest and original
	issue discount of $12,222 which is being amortized over the term of the note of 2 years from the date of advance. The Company
	calculated an initial derivative liability on the note of $99,211. $52,242 was recorded as debt discount and is being amortized
	over the term of the note.This derivative liability was revalued and on September 30, 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability
	was $87,241. The change in derivative liability was charged to the income statement. During the three months ended September 30,
	2015, the Company amortized $8,020 of debt discount and $1,960 of the original issue discount and interest.




	 




	On
	May 26, 2015, the Company entered into another convertible note agreement for $110,000. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company
	is to receive $100,000 against the $110,000 note, after the original issue discount of $10,000. The lender advanced $50,000 at
	closing and altered the original issue discount to $6,000 plus legal fees of $5,000. The, Maturity Date of the note is May 26,
	2016. The lender has the right, at any time after 90 days of the advance, at its election, to convert all or part of the outstanding
	and unpaid principal sum and accrued interest (and any other fees) into shares of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common
	stock of the Company as per the conversion formula. The conversion price is 40% of the lowest trade price in the 25 trading days
	immediately preceding the issuance date or 40% of lowest trading price during 25 days immediately prior to the conversion. A one-time
	Interest charge of 10% shall be applied to the principal sum. Since the note is not convertible until August 26, 2015, the Company
	did not record any derivative liability on the note at closing, but did so on August 24, 2015, in the amount of $140,532 and recorded
	$50,000 as debt discount and is being amortized over the term of the note. This derivative liability was revalued and on September
	30, 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability was $102,234. The change in derivative liability was charged to the income
	statement. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company amortized $6,703 of debt discount and $3,817 of the original
	issue discount and interest.

	The
	Company entered into another convertible note agreement on June 9, 2015 for $250,000. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company shall
	receive $225,000 against the $250,000 note, after the original issue discount of $25,000. The maturity date of the note is 2 years
	from the date of each advance. The lender has the right, at any time after the advance, at its election, to convert all or part
	of the outstanding and unpaid principal sum and accrued interest (and any other fees) into shares of fully paid and non-assessable
	shares of common stock of the Company as per the conversion formula. The conversion price is the lesser of $0.05 or 55% of lowest
	trading price during 25 days immediately preceding the conversion date. A one-time Interest charge of 12% shall be applied to
	the principal sum. The lender advanced $50,000 at the closing of note. Pursuant to the terms of the note, the original issue discount
	amounted to $5,556. Since, the note did not have a conventional conversion feature and had a variable conversion price indexed
	to the market price, the conversion feature was separately valued and was recorded as a derivative liability. The Company calculated
	an initial derivative liability on the note of $168,325. Of this value, $50,000 was recorded as debt discount and is being amortized
	over the term of the note. The balance amount of $118,325 was recorded as derivative liability. This derivative liability was
	revalued and on September 30, 2015, the fair value of the derivative liability was $79,882. The change in derivative liability
	was charged to the income statement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company amortized $6,301 of debt discount
	and $1,462 of the original issue discount and interest.

	Corporate
	Overview






	 





	We
	were formed as a Nevada corporation, “Rolling Technologies, Inc.” on July 27, 2007. On August 12, 2013, we changed
	our name to Solaris Power Cells, Inc. Effective August 12, 2013, we effected a 24 for 1 forward stock split of our authorized,
	and issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Our authorized common stock increased from 90,000,000 shares of common stock
	to 2,160,000,000 shares of common stock.




	 




	We
	are developing a renewable energy storage device, known as a “passive electron storage array”, to market to residential
	and commercial industrial users. We currently have developed a prototype of our Solaris Power Cell, which is a 100% lead-free,
	solid state digital storage device. Our device provides a PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) that creates an intelligent power
	cell creating digital energy storage solution capable of providing energy storage to applications normally reliant and equipped
	with highly toxic lead acid, nickel metal hydride batteries. Our products can use any renewable or non-renewable energy source
	including sun, wind, water, motion or thermal to provide the energy to be stored. To date we do not have any sales contracts.




	 




	Our
	system stores DC energy at a rate limited only by the network feeding it, as it has efficiencies reaching 98%. Our product design
	allows for mass production and we anticipate it will compete head on with lead acid batteries.




	 




	Off-grid
	lithium-ion and other battery types currently used in energy storage is limited in the flow of energy that can be accepted and
	stored at any given time and suffer from deficiencies such as short-life-cycles and are a hazardous waste product. In a typical
	battery, only a percentage of the energy sent to the battery is accepted; the balance is wasted. Our product is anticipated to
	accept close to 100% of its storage capacity very quickly because our charging process is only limited by the network, and not
	our technology.




	 




	A
	normal battery can take hours to recharge, whereas our product can recharge in significantly less time compared to similar voltage
	storage capacity. A typical battery has a lifespan of 400-500 charge/discharge cycles, whereas our product can have 1,000,000
	charge/discharge cycles.




	 




	Solar
	panel manufacturers and other energy providers are working to maximize the amount of electrical power they can generate, but they
	are losing that power to poor battery performance. We hope we can provide a better solution to those manufactures for use by the
	end users, and into new markets.




	 




	We
	incorporate and implement a digital balancing design to insure the proper voltage is maintained on each power cell, thus making
	each cell smart. The energy is available to the regulator circuits that will regulate the output current and voltage. The capacity
	of the storage transfer rate is not limited in voltage or current and is controlled by our intelligent power controller and can
	be configured per application. The output of regulator section can be greater or less than the input voltage provided by the power
	cell. The output from the power cell system is regulated AC or DC power provided to the connected electrical systems.




	 





	Results
	of Operations






	 





	The
	following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the three
	and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014.




	 





	Revenues





	 




	We
	have limited operational history. We do not anticipate earning adequate revenues until we procure additional financing to manufacture
	and market our products. There is no assurance that we will earn adequate revenues or amounts that will enable us to continue
	as a going concern. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, we generated $24,658 and $30,110 from
	the sale of inventory and experimental items.




	 





	Expenses






	 





	Our
	operating expenses for the three months ended September 30. 2015 and 2014 were $83,629 and $166,760 respectively. The reduction
	of $83,131 or 50% was the result of managements’ decision to discontinue their salaries beyond December 31, 2014 minus additional
	costs attributed to the retention of outsourced consulting services and additional research and development on new products.




	 




	Operating
	expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $1,004,274, including $778,770 of stock based compensation compared
	to $771,736 which included stock based compensation of $154,167. The increase in expenses was primarily the result of outsourcing
	consulting services to work on the development of our products.

	Our
	working capital deficiency increased from a deficiency of $179,032 to a working capital deficiency of $257,856 primarily as a
	result of continued operational costs, additional stock based payroll costs and ongoing research and development.




	 




	We
	have incurred operating losses since inception, and this is likely to continue in the foreseeable future. We require funds to
	enable us to address our minimum current and ongoing expenses.





	 






	Cash
	Flows






	 





	During
	the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we used net cash in operating activities in the amount of $207,453 compared to $554,901
	for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The reduction in cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared
	to the same nine months in 2014, was primarily due to the reduction of cash paid for expenses associated with research and development,
	advertising, marketing, accounting, legal and wages.




	 




	Our
	cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased to $200,750 from $450,000 as the
	result of a reduction in the sales of common stock.




	 




	No
	cash was used for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to $4,482 during the nine months
	ended September 30, 2014.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	We
	anticipate that our cash on hand will not be sufficient to satisfy all of our cash requirements for the next twelve month period.
	We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing and may not be able to obtain additional financing, particularly,
	if the volatile conditions in the stock and financial markets persist. If we require any additional financing, we plan to raise
	any such additional capital primarily through equity financing and loans from our directors, provided that such funding continues
	to be available to our company. We plan to continue to seek additional funds from our directors to fund our day-to-day operations
	until equity financing can be pursued. We have no guarantee that our directors will continue to fund our day-today operations.
	The issuance of additional equity securities by our company may result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our
	current stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations
	or that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable
	terms. If we are not able to obtain additional financing as required on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet certain obligations
	as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.




	 





	Future
	Financings





	 




	We
	will require additional financing to fund our planned operations, including further development, regulatory requirements, and
	commercializing our existing assets. We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing and may not be able to
	obtain additional financing, particularly, if the volatile conditions in the stock and financial markets, and more particularly,
	the market for early development stage company stocks persist.




	 




	There
	can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on
	commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed,
	we will be forced to delay or scale down some or all of our development activities or perhaps even cease the operation of our
	business.




	 









	 



	5



	 









	 


	 


	 






	 



	Since
	inception, we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund
	our operations through the equity and debt financing. If we raise additional financing by issuing equity securities, our existing
	stockholders’ ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase
	our liabilities and future cash commitments.




	 




	There
	is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his, her,
	or its investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements






	 





	We
	have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
	resources that is material to investors.




	 





	Risks
	Associated with our Business





	 





	We
	will encounter manufacturing risks and may face product liability claims.






	 





	Our
	manufacture and sale of battery systems may expose us to significant risk of product liability claims. We may obtain product liability
	insurance, but such coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we may incur, or we may not be able to maintain
	adequate product liability insurance at acceptable rates. If a product liability claim or series of claims were brought against
	us for uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insurance coverage, and it is ultimately determined that we are liable,
	we may be liable to pay the claim, which could exceed the resources available to us. In addition, we could experience some material
	design or manufacturing failure, a quality system failure, other safety issues or heightened regulatory scrutiny that may warrant
	a recall of our products. A recall of any of our products could also result in increased product liability claims and damage to
	our reputation.




	 





	Since
	we lack a meaningful operating history, it is difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business.






	 





	Our
	limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our business or prospective operations. We are
	subject to all the risks inherent in the initial organization, financing, expenditures, complications and delays inherent in a
	new business. Investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by new companies in an intensely
	competitive industry. Our business is dependent upon the implementation of our business plan, as well as our ability to enter
	into agreements with third parties for, among other things, the manufacturing of our products on commercially favorable terms.
	There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to attain profitability.




	 





	We
	may not be able to achieve commercialization of any products on the timetable we anticipate, or at all.





	 




	We
	cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to develop commercially viable battery systems on the timetable we anticipate,
	or at all. The continued commercialization of our battery system requires substantial technological advances to improve the efficiency,
	functionality, durability, reliability, cost and performance of these products and to develop commercial volume manufacturing
	processes for our future products. Developing our technology may require substantial capital, and we cannot assure you that we
	will be able to generate or secure sufficient funding on acceptable terms to pursue commercialization plans on a larger scale.
	In addition, before any product can be released to market, it must be subjected to numerous field tests. These field tests may
	encounter problems and delays for a number of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. If these field tests reveal technical
	defects or reveal that our potential products do not meet performance goals, including useful life, reliability, and durability,
	our commercialization schedule could be delayed, and potential purchasers may decline to purchase future systems and products.




	 




	The
	commercialization of our battery systems also may depend on our ability to significantly reduce the costs of future systems and
	products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently reduce the cost of these products versus existing technologies
	without reducing performance, reliability and durability, which would adversely affect consumers’ willingness to buy future
	products.




	 









	 



	6



	 









	 


	 


	 







	 





	We
	cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute our business plan.






	 





	The
	execution of our business plan poses many challenges and is based on a number of assumptions. We cannot assure you that we will
	be able to execute our business plan. Narrowing the scope of our development activities may not accelerate product commercialization.
	If we experience significant cost overruns on any of our product development programs, or if our business plan is more costly
	than anticipated, certain research and development activities may be delayed or eliminated, resulting in changes or delays to
	our commercialization plans.




	 





	Potential
	fluctuations in our financial and business results makes forecasting difficult and may restrict our access to funding for our
	commercialization plan.






	 





	We
	expect our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and even year to year. As a result, quarter to quarter
	or year to year comparisons of these operating results are not expected to be meaningful. Due to our business’ stage of
	development, it is difficult to predict potential future revenues, if any, or results of operations accurately. It is likely that
	in one or more future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, if
	any, who follow our Company. In addition, investors or security analysts may misunderstand our business decisions or have expectations
	that are inconsistent with our business plan. This may result in our business activities not meeting their expectations. Not meeting
	investor or security analyst expectations may materially and adversely impact the trading price of our common shares, and increase
	the cost and restrict our ability to secure required funding to pursue our commercialization plans.




	 





	A
	mass market for our products may never develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate.





	 




	We
	do not know whether end-users will want to use our products. The development of a mass market for our battery system may be affected
	by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products,
	the future cost of raw materials used by our systems, regulatory requirements, consumer perceptions of the safety of any developed
	products and consumer reluctance to buy a new product.




	 




	If
	a mass market fails to develop or develops more slowly than anticipated, we may be unable to recover the losses it will have incurred
	in the development of our current and potential future products and may never achieve profitability. In addition, we cannot guarantee
	that we will be able to develop, manufacture or market any products if sales levels do not support the continuation of those products.




	 





	Regulatory
	changes could hurt the market for our products.

	in existing government regulations and the emergence of new regulations with respect to our products may hurt the market for our
	future products. Environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries have driven interest in alternate energy systems.
	We cannot guarantee that these laws and policies will not change. Changes in these laws and other laws and policies or the failure
	of these laws and policies to become more widespread could result in consumers abandoning their interest in our products in favor
	of alternative technologies. In addition, as alternative energy products are introduced into the market, the governments in countries
	we intend to market our products may impose burdensome requirements and restrictions on the use of these technologies that could
	reduce or eliminate demand for some or all of our potential products.




	 





	If
	we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology, which could weaken our competitive
	position, eliminate the potential for future revenue and increase costs.






	 





	We
	believe that our long-term success will depend to a large degree on our ability to protect the proprietary technology that we
	have developed or any other technology that we may develop or acquire in the future. Although we intend to aggressively pursue
	anyone we reasonably believe is infringing upon our intellectual property rights, initiating and maintaining suits against third
	parties that may infringe upon those intellectual property rights will require substantial financial resources. In addition, significant
	financial resources could be required to defend against any suits brought against us claiming our infringement of others’
	intellectual property rights. We may not have the financial resources to bring or defend such suits, and if such suits emerge,
	we may not prevail. Regardless of our success in any such actions, we could incur significant expenses in connection with such
	suits.

	Failure
	to protect any intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business and prospects because we believe that developing
	new systems and products that are unique to us is critical to our success. We will rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and
	copyright law to protect our intellectual property. However, some of the intellectual property may not be covered by any patent
	or patent application, and certain patents will eventually expire. We cannot assure that any present or future issued patents
	will protect the technology. Moreover, our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to
	uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent. Accordingly, there is no assurance that:




	 






	 




	●




	any
	of the patents or patent applications developed, acquired or licensed by us will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged,
	or rendered unenforceable; or






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	any
	potential future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us, if issued at all.






	 




	In
	addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in
	certain countries.




	 




	We
	may also seek to protect any proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable,
	in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors’ rights agreements with strategic partners and employees.
	We can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or
	that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships.




	 




	Future
	intellectual property may be acquired without typical representations and warranties. If necessary or desirable, we may seek further
	licenses under the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. However, we can give no assurances that we will obtain
	such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third
	party for intellectual property we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the development, manufacture
	or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the use of such intellectual property.




	 





	We
	may be involved in intellectual property litigation that causes us to incur significant expenses or prevents us from selling any
	developed products.






	 





	We
	may become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or commence
	lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing upon our rights. Involvement in intellectual property litigation could result
	in significant expense, adversely affecting the development of the challenged product or intellectual property and diverting the
	efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in its favor. In the event of an
	adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may, among other things, be required to:




	 






	 




	●




	pay
	substantial damages;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	cease
	the development, manufacture, use, sale or importation of any developed products that infringe upon other patented intellectual
	property;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	expend
	significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	discontinue
	processes incorporating infringing technology; or






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	obtain
	licenses to the infringing intellectual property.






	 




	We
	can provide no assurance that we would be successful in such development or acquisition, or that such licenses would be available
	upon reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other
	resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

	We
	will face significant competition.






	 





	As
	alternative energy technologies have the potential to replace existing power products, competition for those products will come
	from current power technologies, from improvements to current power technologies, and from new alternative power technologies,
	including other types of alternative energy technologies. Each of our target markets is currently serviced by existing manufacturers
	with existing customers and suppliers. These manufacturers use proven and widely accepted technologies.




	 




	Additionally,
	there are competitors working on developing other technologies related to our system, such as advanced lithium-ion batteries and
	battery/fuel cell hybrids in each of our targeted markets. Some of these technologies are as capable of fulfilling existing and
	proposed regulatory requirements as our technology.




	 




	There
	are many different individuals, institutions and companies across the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan, including corporations,
	national laboratories and universities that are actively engaged in the development and manufacture of alternative energy technologies.
	Each of these competitors has the potential to capture market share in any of our future target markets.




	 




	Many
	of these competitors have substantial financial resources, customer bases, strategic alliances, manufacturing, marketing and sales
	capabilities, and businesses or other resources which give them significant competitive advantages over our company.




	 





	The
	loss of the services of certain key employees, or the failure to attract additional key individuals, would materially adversely
	affect our business.





	 




	Our
	success will depend on the continued services of certain technology development and marketing personnel. In addition, our success
	depends in large part on our ability in the future to attract and retain key management, engineering, scientific, manufacturing
	and operating personnel. Recruiting personnel for the alternative energy industries is highly competitive. We cannot guarantee
	that we will be able to attract and retain qualified executive, managerial and technical personnel needed for the development
	of potential products business. Our failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our
	business. Liquidity issues, discussed earlier, could severely impact our ability to attract qualified key personnel or retain
	existing personnel.




	 





	New
	legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract officers and directors.





	 




	The

	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

	was enacted in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection
	with recent accounting scandals. The stated goals of the

	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

	are to increase corporate responsibility,
	to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors
	by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The

	Sarbanes-Oxley Act
	of 2002

	generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, under the

	Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934

	. Upon becoming a public company, we will be required to comply with the

	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

	.
	The enactment of the

	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

	has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the SEC that increase
	responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers. The perceived increased personal risk associated with these
	recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract
	and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We continue to evaluate and monitor
	developments with respect to these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the
	timing of such costs.




	 





	Risks
	Associated with our Financial Condition






	 






	Because
	our auditor has issued a going concern opinion regarding our company, there is an increased risk associated with an investment
	in our company.





	 




	We
	have incurred cumulative net losses of $5,765,656 since July 27, 2007. We have not attained profitable operations. As of September
	30, 2015 we had cash in the amount of $58,876. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing or upon future profitable
	operations. We reserve the right to seek additional funds through private placements of our common stock and/or through debt financing.
	Our ability to raise additional financing is unknown. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the advancement
	or loan of funds. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report to our financial statements for the year ended December
	31, 2014 that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern. As a result, there is an increased risk
	that you could lose the entire amount of your investment in our company.

	Risks
	Related to Our Securities





	 





	If
	a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares.






	 





	A
	market for our common stock may never develop. We are listed for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board but have limited trading. A
	public market may not materialize. If a public market for our common stock does not develop, investors may not be able to sell
	the shares of our common stock that they have purchased and may lose all of their investment.




	 





	If
	we issue shares of preferred stock with superior rights than the common stock, it could result in the decrease the value of our
	common stock and delay or prevent a change in control of us.





	 




	Our
	board of directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the power to
	establish the dividend rates, liquidation preferences, voting rights, redemption and conversion terms and privileges with respect
	to any series of preferred stock. The issuance of any shares of preferred stock having rights superior to those of the common
	stock may result in a decrease in the value or market price of the common stock. Holders of preferred stock may have the right
	to receive dividends, certain preferences in liquidation and conversion rights. The issuance of preferred stock could, under certain
	circumstances, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us without further vote or action by
	the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock.




	 





	If
	a public market for our common stock develops, short selling could increase the volatility of our stock price.






	 





	Short
	selling occurs when a person sells shares of stock which the person does not yet own and promises to buy stock in the future to
	cover the sale. The general objective of the person selling the shares short is to make a profit by buying the shares later, at
	a lower price, to cover the sale. Significant amounts of short selling, or the perception that a significant amount of short sales
	could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. In contrast, purchases to cover a short position may have the
	effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty
	bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock
	may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued
	at any time. These transactions may be effected on over-the-counter bulletin board or any other available markets or exchanges.
	Such short selling, if it were to occur, could impact the value of our stock in an extreme and volatile manner to the detriment
	of our shareholders.




	 





	Because
	we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common
	stock.





	 




	We
	have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to
	finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
	Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors,
	including, but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit
	agreements that we may be a party to at the time. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their own common stock after price
	appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not
	purchase our common stock.




	 





	Because
	we will be subject to the “Penny Stock” rules, the level of trading activity in our stock may be limited.






	 





	Broker-dealer
	practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities
	and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered
	on some national securities exchanges or quoted on NASDAQ). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction
	in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information
	about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer
	with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction,
	and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed
	control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s
	account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited
	investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
	receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing
	the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules, and investors
	in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.

	We
	will be required to remain current in our filings with the SEC and our securities will not be eligible for quotation on the over-the-counter
	bulletin board if we are not current in our filings with the SEC.





	 




	In
	the event that our shares are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board, we will be required order to remain current in our
	filings with the SEC in order for shares of our common stock to be eligible for quotation on the over-the-counter bulletin board.
	In the event that we become delinquent in our required filings with the SEC, quotation of our common stock will be terminated
	following a 30 day grace period if we do not make our required filing during that time. If our shares are not eligible for quotation
	on the over-the-counter bulletin board, investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.

	Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures





	 




	As
	required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the

	Securities Exchange Act of 1934

	, our management, with the
	participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q, these disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
	was due to material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in our annual report
	on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2014.




	 




	Because
	of the inherent limitations in all control systems, our management believes that no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
	assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
	that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	 





	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended September 30, 2015, that have materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

	I, Leonard
	M. Caprino, certify that:




	 






	1.




	I
	have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Solaris Power Cells, Inc.;






	 




	 






	2.




	Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
	to the period covered by this report;






	 




	 






	3.




	Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
	presented in this report;






	 




	 






	4.




	I
	am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
	and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for
	the registrant and have:






	 






	 




	(a)




	designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
	me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(b)




	designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
	my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(c)




	evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
	on such evaluation; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(d)




	disclosed
	in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s
	most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting;
	and






	 






	5.




	I
	have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s
	auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):






	 






	 




	(a)




	all
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(b)




	any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.






	 




	Dated:
	November 16, 2015

﻿﻿﻿﻿Solaris PESA™ TechnologyEnergy Storage Solution - ESS﻿﻿﻿﻿INSTANTANEOUS STORAGE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY FOR USE ON DEMAND









Solaris Power Cells answers the energy storage challenge with the Passive Electron Storage Array (PESA™) - a 100% renewable energy storage solution (ESS) with compelling advantages over battery storage systems.Electrical system designers are eager to use renewable energy solutions that reduce reliance on polluting fossil fuels.  Storing renewable energy generated during peak hours for later use, however, is a challenge for engineers.  An emerging approach to this challenge is the use of battery storage.  Unfortunately battery storage suffers from drawbacks not limited to:Short lifetimes and associated replacement and maintenance costsInefficient charging behavior that results in less than optimal electrical performanceBattery solutions are not environmentally friendly solutions.Solaris engineering has developed the Solaris PESA™ (Passive Electron Storage Array) - a solid state energy storage solution.  Our system uses the energy collected by solar panels to charge a PESA™ array. When the renewable is no longer available the PESA™ array provides its stored energy where its needed.
 






 






﻿Technology Tipping Point ﻿
Solaris Power Cells major business and revenue plans are focused on energy storage and management solutions for utilities and power grids.  These are systems that store, buffer and/or balance electrical energy produced through both traditional and renewable (solar, wind, etc.) sources.  Four factors are fueling an immediate demand for Solaris’ PESA™ technology. The California Public Utilities Commission approved a target requiring the state’s three largest investor-owned utilities, aggregators, and other energy service providers to procure 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage by 2020.According to research firm HIS, the energy storage market is set to ‘explode’ to an annual installation size of 6 gigawatts in 2017 and over 40 gigawatts by 2022.  This contrasts against an initial installed base of 0.34 gigawatts installed in 2012 and 2013. The total market for energy storage in photovoltaic systems has been estimated at $19 billion in 2017. (‘The Role of Energy Storage in the PV Industry,’ IMS Research, 2012).  The market for supercapacitor components in renewable energy, grid balancing, infrastructure and other electrical systems has been estimated at $1.9 billion in 2023 (IDTechEx, 2013).
﻿Welcome to Solaris Power Cells﻿
﻿Solaris Power Cells is a publicly traded Nevada corporation.  (OTC: SPCL)  The company has spent several years largely in an R&D phase having developed the PESA™ system for Energy Storage along with several products that demonstrate the technology.  These demonstration products are a self-recharging neighborhood utility vehicle (NUV) and a ‘vapor mod’ smoking system.  ﻿
