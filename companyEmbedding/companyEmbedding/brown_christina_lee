Obituary
Carrier-Journal.com
Sep. 27, 2011Owsley Brown II, Louisville philanthropist and 
		retired chairman of his family-controlled liquor company died late 
		Monday after a brief illness.

		Son-in-law Matthew Barzun said the death was the result of complications 
		from pneumonia.

Brown, who turned 69 earlier this month, was a great-grandson of the 
		founder of Brown-Forman and worked in the family business for about 40 
		years, including 12 years as chief executive.

		During his tenure, the distiller expanded its footprint overseas, 
		bringing brands such as Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort to millions 
		of new customers outside the United States.

		On Brown's watch as CEO from 1993 to 2005, the company's stock value 
		more than quadrupled and outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index, a 
		broad measure of U.S. stocks. Brown also served as chairman from 1995 
		until his retirement in 2007.

		"Owsley was a personal friend to so many of us across the world and we 
		are all shocked and saddened by his premature death," Paul Varga, who 
		succeeded Brown as chief executive, said in a statement released Tuesday 
		by the company. "Owsley was a truly remarkable man with a brilliant 
		mind. ... He generously shared these unique gifts to build Brown-Forman 
		into the global success it is today and to establish long-lasting 
		friendships throughout our industry."

		"Owsley Brown has left a legacy in our city in so many ways, from the 
		arts, education and business community to the environment and interfaith 
		issues," Mayor Greg Fischer said in a statement Tuesday. "I've lost a 
		dear friend and the community has lost a compassionate man ."

		A Republican until December 2006 when he became a Democrat, Brown 
		supported Fischer, a Democrat, in his bid to replace Jerry Abramson, who 
		was not seeking reelection.

		U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that he 
		knew Brown for more than 30 years.

		"Louisville lost a great friend today; he will be missed," McConnell 
		said.

		When he retired, Brown, a graduate of Yale and Stanford universities, 
		said he would take a step toward another legacy: philanthropy. His 
		efforts extended to organizations that supported art and music, historic 
		preservation and environmental protection. He was active in Actors 
		Theatre of Louisville, the Fund for the Arts and River Fields, where he 
		was a board member.

		Last year, his family's Owsley Brown Charitable Foundation of which he 
		was president, gave $769,837 to a variety of churches and community 
		groups, including more than $100,000 in donations to the Center for 
		Interfaith Relations, according to tax records. In both 2006 and 2008, 
		tax records show the foundation's giving totaled $1.2 million.

		But his interest in the arts was more than financial.

		A 1971 Courier-Journal article said it wasn't uncommon for Brown — as 
		Actors' board president — to be seen cleaning windows or lugging props 
		at the theater in his spare time. He also helped lead efforts for Actors 
		to secure its current Main Street location.

		Jon Jory, who led the theater for 31 years and founded the Humana 
		Festival of New American Plays, said "Owsley was not only a friend, but 
		a friend who amazed me. ... I have used him as my example of what one 
		can be and do for years. "

		In a 2007 Courier-Journal article about Brown's retirement, Christina 
		Lee "Christy" Brown described her husband as a "brilliant thinker" with 
		a passion for architecture and history. Contemplative and humble, he 
		wouldn't readily admit that he spoke or read French, German and some 
		Italian, and created oil paintings in his spare time, she said.

		At the Speed Art Museum, he was vice chairman of the board and headed a 
		building committee overseeing a planned expansion.

		Christy and Owsley "were up in the galleries all the time," Speed 
		director Charles Venable said in a phone interview. Brown would arrange 
		his schedule so that meetings at the museum could be augmented by time 
		seeing what was new in the galleries, Venable said.

		Brown's death came five months after that of his mother, Sara 
		Shallenberger "Sally" Brown, the family matriarch who was 100, and had 
		spearheaded a restoration of the Locust Grove historic property.

		After earning a master's in business administration from Stanford, 
		Owsley Brown II worked as an Army intelligence officer at the Pentagon. 
		Most of his adult years were spent with the family business. He started 
		at Brown-Forman in 1961 as a summer employee, the company said.

		At Brown-Forman, Brown oversaw the acquisition of key brands including 
		Finlandia vodka and Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards.

		While he broadened the company's spirits portfolio, his favorite 
		cocktail was traditional: The company's founding brand, Old Forester 
		Bourbon with ice and a little water in a tall glass.

		Earlier this year, Brown received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate 
		Citizenship and along with his wife, Christy, Greater Louisville Inc.'s 
		Gold Cup award in honor of their civic and philanthropic leadership.

		"Owsley instilled a culture of enduring growth for which the board and 
		family are truly indebted," Geo. Garvin Brown IV, chairman of 
		Brown-Forman's board of directors and Brown's cousin, said in a 
		statement. "The continued strength of the company and its role as a 
		responsible global citizen are the greatest testaments to his life's 
		work."

		Brown is survived by his wife, Christy; three children, Owsley III (Victoire), 
		Brooke Barzun (Matthew), and Augusta Holland (Gill); and nine 
		grandchildren.

		A public visitation will be held Thursday at The Speed Art Museum from 
		3-6 p.m. The funeral will be 10 a.m. Friday at Christ Church Cathedral 
		on Second Street followed by a private burial at Breeze Hill Farm, the 
		Oldham County farm he owned with his wife.

		The family requests that donations be directed to the Metro United Way 
		or the Fund for the Arts.

		"The last thing he would want in the world is for people to say, ‘well, 
		now that he's gone we can't accomplish what he was helping us to 
		accomplish,'" the Speed's Venable said. "He more than anybody knows that 
		life can be fleeting and that Louisville needs to raise the bar and 
		really do great things going forward."

Editorial
Carrier-Journal.com
Sep. 27, 2011


The sadly premature death Monday night of Owsley 
		Brown II at the age of 69 deprives Louisville of one of its most 
		generous and committed benefactors.

		U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth was right when he noted, "Nobody took the 
		responsibilities of being a citizen more seriously" than Mr. Brown. His 
		generosity and leadership in the fine arts, historic preservation and 
		the quest for world peace set a gold standard for community leadership.

		As chief executive of Brown-Forman from 1993 to 2005 and chairman from 
		1995 to 2007, Mr. Brown carried on a family legacy that dated back to 
		the liquor company's founding in 1870. While in charge of the company, 
		he led a vigorous effort to expand its international profile and to 
		modernize the marketing of its brands, with the result that labels such 
		as Jack Daniel's whiskey and Finlandia vodka became readily recognized 
		worldwide. The company's financial returns were impressive.

		However, as the liquor market — like most other industries — went 
		global, Brown-Forman remained a Louisville company and a major corporate 
		citizen. It has almost 1,200 local employees, still makes whiskey in 
		Jefferson County and has resisted the impulse to move its headquarters 
		despite what it feels is a tax climate that singles out its industry 
		unfairly.

		Mr. Brown's own role in his hometown was prominent. He served on 
		numerous boards, and led fund-raising drives for the Greater Louisville 
		Fund for the Arts and Actors Theatre of Louisville. He was lauded for 
		his leadership in the rehabilitation of the Actors Theatre building, the 
		Cathedral of the Assumption and Brown-Forman's building in the 600 block 
		of West Main Street.

		After retirement, Mr. Brown and his wife, Christy, expanded their 
		already sizable philanthropic and community outreach, donating hundreds 
		of thousands of dollars from his family's charitable foundation to 
		religious and community groups. Last year's gifts included more than 
		$100,000 to the Center for Interfaith Relations.

		In one of his final public pronouncements, Mr. Brown used the occasion 
		of receipt of the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship in June 
		to stress that in community life, as in business, better is preferable 
		to bigger — and bigger is desirable only when it results from becoming 
		better.

		That serves as a fitting epitaph for Mr. Brown — an emphasis on 
		excellence. And, as happened so often, he leaves his community yet 
		another insight to ponder.

Remembrance
Christopher L. ("Kit") Kincade '64
		Sep. 30, 2011
		Owsley was a tremendous force for good in the Louisville community. In 
		addition to the many philanthropic efforts cited in his obituary, Owsley 
		also supported a program called "Bulldogs in the Bluegrass," where we 
		bring Yale undergraduates to Louisville in the summer for internships. 
		The genius and driver behind that movement, Rowan Claypool '80, extols 
		the work of Owsley and his wife Christy in helping to get it off the 
		ground.

Christine Lee Brown Allegedly Dials 911 To Thank Sheriff For Bologna Sandwiches

She had the wurst reasons for calling 911.
Christine Lee Brown, of Palm Bay, Fla., was arrested on Saturday after allegedly calling 911 repeatedly to thank Sheriff Jeff Parker for the bologna sandwiches she had previously eaten while in jail. 
With each call, the dispatcher asked the 51-year-old if she was experiencing an emergency, but she just kept talking about the sandwiches, Florida Today reports.
Police arrived at Brown's home while she was still on the phone with the dispatcher.
The woman was given the opportunity to enjoy those sandwiches once again after being booked into the Brevard County Jail Complex on a $3,000 bond. She has been charged with six felony counts of misuse of 911. 
Brown is not the first Floridian to misunderstand the purpose of the 911 line. In August, Joshua Basso allegedly called 911 seven times to request that female deputies come have sex with him. 
And in September, teenager Mark Welch allegedly made two emergency calls trying to convince dispatchers that everything he had dreamt was becoming a reality.

Exterior of the Visitor Center


Louisville Stoneware, previously known as Louisville Pottery, is located in the Highlands section of Louisville, Kentucky. Founded in 1815, making it one of the oldest stoneware companies in the United States, it creates fanciful stoneware that is nationally renowned.[1][2][3] It specializes in decorating its pottery with Kentucky Derby and Christmas themes, but it has other themes as well: Noah's Ark, Primrose, and Pear being examples. They can also create personalized items. Besides pottery, they have made bird baths and bird feeders.[3]

The JB Taylor Company was founded in 1815 in Louisville, Kentucky. But it was not owned by John B. Taylor until 1938. In 1970 the company was sold and became known as Louisville Stoneware. The company is still produces the stoneware. Some of the old patterns are still in production as well as many new designs.
Some of the oldest patterns include Harvest and Vintage. In the earlier days, the artists were likely to experiment with different designs and you can occasionally find a unique treasure in antique/consignment shops. They also do many pieces on commission for company/event promotions, the best known being their pieces done to commemorate the running of the Kentucky Derby. They also did a pattern for Cracker Barrel Restaurants, Kentucky Fried Chicken and many more.
The fun aspect of this stoneware is the different patterns and individual hand painted designs, from Bachelor Button, Country Flowers, hummingbirds, 12 Days of Christmas, Noah's Ark, etc. As well as some decorative pieces including castles, birdhouses, pet dishes, etc.
One of the better known potters to work for John B. Taylor was MA Hadley (Mary Alice Hadley), who started a company of her own. MA Hadley is very collectible and highly sought after for their varied and creative hand painted patterns.[citation needed]
Hadley Pottery had its inception early in 1940. At that time, M.A.Hadley applied her artistic talents to the making of a custom set of dishes for a cruiser that the Hadleys had on the Ohio River. The Hadley Pottery building was purchased by the Hadley's in October 1944 as a birthday present for Mrs. Hadley. Mrs. Hadley painted all of the murals on the walls of the building.
Since 1997, company sales have averaged $3 million a year. In those ten years, the business switched from a mostly wholesale business to mostly retail. Over 90% of their business has been centered around Louisville and Kentucky, but internet and national advertising is expected to expand distribution.[4]
In March 2007, Louisville Stoneware laid off most of its employees (38 out of 49), after which they retooled their visitor's center and temporarily opened a store at Oxmoor Center in St. Matthews, Kentucky. In July, it was sold to Two Stone Inc., as the previous owner, Christina Lee Brown, wished to retire.[5] The chief concept officer, Lisa Mullins, decided to increase the number of places that sold their stoneware from just one, Taste of Kentucky, to three additional locations in Louisville, and one apiece in Bardstown, Kentucky, Owensboro, Kentucky, and Cincinnati, Ohio.[6] There has been plans to open stores in Chicago, Illinois, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana.[4]
Factory tours are available weekdays by appointment, with group discounts available.[7] It is anticipated that, eventually, tours could make the factory as big a center for Louisville tourism as the Louisville Slugger Museum.[4]
Product[edit]
Clay used by the company comes from western Indiana, and may be up to 250 million years old.[8] Dishes made at the factory have been proven to be safe for use in ovens, microwave ovens, and dishwashers, and can retain heat for keeping food warm.[9]
Cultural references[edit]
Items from Louisville Stoneware are in the Smithsonian Institution and White House.[3] In addition, Queen Elizabeth II was presented a music box made by Louisville Stoneware, given by the wife of Kentucky's governor Ernie Fletcher, that played My Old Kentucky Home when the Queen visited Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby in 2007.[10]
The New York Times singled out Louisville Stoneware as a business especially affected by the United Parcel Service strike of 1997.[11]
During the U.S. presidential campaign of 2004, John Kerry gave a campaign speech on small-business healthcare insurance in May 2004 at Louisville Stoneware.[2]

The company is still produces the stoneware. Some of the old patterns are still in production as well as many new designs.
Some of the oldest patterns include Harvest and Vintage. In the earlier days, the artists were likely to experiment with different designs and you can occasionally find a unique treasure in antique/consignment shops. They also do many pieces on commission for company/event promotions, the best known being their pieces done to commemorate the running of the Kentucky Derby. They also did a pattern for Cracker Barrel Restaurants, Kentucky Fried Chicken and many more.
The fun aspect of this stoneware is the different patterns and individual hand painted designs, from Bachelor Button, Country Flowers, hummingbirds, 12 Days of Christmas, Noah's Ark, etc. As well as some decorative pieces including castles, birdhouses, pet dishes, etc.
One of the better known potters to work for John B. Taylor was MA Hadley (Mary Alice Hadley), who started a company of her own. MA Hadley is very collectible and highly sought after for their varied and creative hand painted patterns.[citation needed]
Hadley Pottery had its inception early in 1940. At that time, M.A.Hadley applied her artistic talents to the making of a custom set of dishes for a cruiser that the Hadleys had on the Ohio River. The Hadley Pottery building was purchased by the Hadley's in October 1944 as a birthday present for Mrs. Hadley. Mrs. Hadley painted all of the murals on the walls of the building.
Since 1997, company sales have averaged $3 million a year. In those ten years, the business switched from a mostly wholesale business to mostly retail. Over 90% of their business has been centered around Louisville and Kentucky, but internet and national advertising is expected to expand distribution.[4]
In March 2007, Louisville Stoneware laid off most of its employees (38 out of 49), after which they retooled their visitor's center and temporarily opened a store at Oxmoor Center in St. Matthews, Kentucky. In July, it was sold to Two Stone Inc., as the previous owner, Christina Lee Brown, wished to retire.[5] The chief concept officer, Lisa Mullins, decided to increase the number of places that sold their stoneware from just one, Taste of Kentucky, to three additional locations in Louisville, and one apiece in Bardstown, Kentucky, Owensboro, Kentucky, and Cincinnati, Ohio.[6] There has been plans to open stores in Chicago, Illinois, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana.[4]
Factory tours are available weekdays by appointment, with group discounts available.[7] It is anticipated that, eventually, tours could make the factory as big a center for Louisville tourism as the Louisville Slugger Museum.[4]
Product[edit]
Clay used by the company comes from western Indiana, and may be up to 250 million years old.[8] Dishes made at the factory have been proven to be safe for use in ovens, microwave ovens, and dishwashers, and can retain heat for keeping food warm.[9]
Cultural references[edit]
Items from Louisville Stoneware are in the Smithsonian Institution and White House.[3] In addition, Queen Elizabeth II was presented a music box made by Louisville Stoneware, given by the wife of Kentucky's governor Ernie Fletcher, that played My Old Kentucky Home when the Queen visited Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby in 2007.[10]
The New York Times singled out Louisville Stoneware as a business especially affected by the United Parcel Service strike of 1997.[11]
During the U.S. presidential campaign of 2004, John Kerry gave a campaign speech on small-business healthcare insurance in May 2004 at Louisville Stoneware.[2]

research overview   


          
 Dr. Christina Lee's research focuses most broadly on developing and implementing innovative clinical treatment research to reduce alcohol/substance use related health disparities in underserved populations.  Other research areas of interest include methods to enhance minority recruitment and retention and mechanisms of change in behavioral health treatment outcomes.

                        

 

research statement   


          
 Dr. Lee has worked on a research program to reduce health disparities from the perspectives of health services and clinical treatment research.  She is currently principal investigator on a grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism to develop and to implement a culturally adapted motivational interview.  Study aims are to 1) compare the efficacy of a culturally adapted motivational interview (MI) incorporating unique risk and cultural factors to standard MI, 2) identify elements of adaptation that influence treatment outcomes and 3) whether treatment adaptation increases its social validity among the targeted population. She is co-I on a NINR-funded study to culturally and linguistically tailor physical activity interventions for Latinas and is a treatment provider delivering motivational interventions to pregnant women who are trying to quit smoking.  She is currently participating on a working group (Borrelli, PI) to analyze treatment outcomes data on a completed study using home care nurses to deliver brief interventions to reduce smoking among Latino parents who have children with asthma.   Dr. Lee has a second line of research that focuses on identifying potential active ingredients of change in alcohol treatment and collaborates with the Injury Prevention Center at Rhode Island Hospital (Department of Emergency Medicine) to analyze treatment outcome data.

Timeless Lee Jeans for Women
Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
