How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

 What now?  


There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.




 1. Create a retirement income strategy 
 2. Maximize 
                  social security 




 Learn how annuities can help keep your money growing in 
                    retirement, and turn a lump sum into guaranteed income that 
                    lasts for as long as you live. See more → 
 If you are entitled to collect income from Social Security, 
                    there are steps you can take to help you maximize your benefit.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.

Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Prudential Investment Portfolios, Inc. 17:


In planning and performing our audit of the financial
statements of Prudential Total Return Bond Fund (formerly
Prudential Total Return Bond Fund, Inc), a series of
Prudential Investment Portfolios, Inc. 17 (hereafter referred
to as the "Fund"), as of and for the year ended October 31,
2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including
controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for
designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of
expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to
comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion.


Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and
judgments by management are required to assess the expected
benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.


A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting
exists when the design or operation of a control does not
allow management or employees, in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.


Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in
the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all
deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted
no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material
weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2013.


This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and the Board of Directors of the Fund and the
Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be
and should not be used by anyone other than these specified
parties.

				The Power of Tax Deferral
			 
		






When you invest in a tax-deferred account such as a variable annuity, you delay paying income tax until you begin taking withdrawals, presumably after you retire.
So, instead of paying taxes on any investment growth each year, you keep that money compounding to help grow your retirement savings.

 Assumptions: 7% annual growth for all hypothetical accounts. The taxable investments assume taxes are withdrawn at 25% and 39.6% at the end of every year.
Tax-deferred accounts are subject to ordinary income tax at the time of withdrawals.
The hypothetical example does not reflect a specific annuity, an actual account value or the performance of any investment. It does not include fees or portfolio expenses which would lower performance.

Footnote

What is a variable annuity?

A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company. It's a long-term investment designed for retirement purposes. You invest money in professionally managed investment portfolios, where it accumulates tax-deferred. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. When you retire, your investment can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live. In addition, variable annuities may provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries. It is important to remember that annuity contracts contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force.

Why does the company behind the annuity matter?

When the time comes for you to use the benefits that are offered by a variable annuity it is important to remember that all guarantees including the optional benefits are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and do not apply to the underlying investment options.

Who can help me determine if an annuity is right for me?

Your financial professional can help you determine if a variable annuity is suitable for you. Prudential Annuities and its distributors and representatives do not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice. Please consult your own attorney or accountant when making important investment decisions.
	Prudential Annuities does not provide investment advice. The selections you choose together with your financial professional are all dependent on your investment goals and your risk tolerance.

What happens if I need access to my money?

There are limitations and restrictions when making withdrawals. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty, sometimes referred to as an additional income tax. Withdrawals reduce the account value and the living and death benefits proportionately.

What is the Protected Withdrawal Value?

The Protected Withdrawal Value is only used to calculate the initial guaranteed lifetime income and the charge for the benefit. It is separate from the account value and is not available as a lump sum withdrawal. The account value is not guaranteed, can fluctuate, and may lose value.

What are the costs associated with purchasing this product?

The Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuities are available at an annual insurance cost comprised of a .55% account value-based charge and a .55% premium-based charge for the B Series, and .68% account value- based charge and a .67% premium-based charge for the C Series with additional fees related to the professionally managed investment portfolios. The Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit is available for an additional annual insurance cost comprised of a .18% account value-based charge and a .17% premium-based charge. Additional fees, such as withdrawal fees, transfer fees and administrative fees, also apply. See the prospectus for more information about how these charges are calculated.

What are some of the other things I need to consider when investing in this product?

If you invest in this product through a tax-advantaged retirement plan, such as an IRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, 401(a) plan, or non-ERISA 403(b) plan, you will get no additional tax advantage through the annuity itself. Because there is no additional tax advantage when a variable annuity is purchased through one of these plans, the reasons for purchasing the annuity inside a qualified plan are limited to the ability to elect the Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit, the opportunity to annuitize the contract, and the various investment options, which might make the annuity an appropriate investment for you. You should consult your tax and financial advisors regarding such features and benefits prior to purchasing this annuity for use with a tax-qualified plan.

What are some of the other considerations that I need to think about when investing in various asset allocation portfolios offered by a variable annuity?

It is important to remember that asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. The value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equity-related security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money. Additionally, fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, a subaccount's share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase. Certain asset allocation portfolios may use leverage, short sales, and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments. These practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk, size, and velocity of investment losses. Although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets, no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful. The fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments. Lastly, diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market.

What do I need to understand about some of the asset allocation portfolios (subaccounts) that are offered with this product?

Premier Investment offers certain subaccounts that invest in underlying portfolios or invest in other portfolios which are also available in other variable annuity contracts we offer. Those other variable annuity contracts offer certain optional living benefits that utilize a predetermined mathematical formula (the "formula") to manage the guarantees offered in connection with those optional benefits. You should be aware that the operation of the formula in those other variable annuity contracts may result in large-scale asset flows into and out of the underlying portfolios through a series of transfers. In addition to increasing the portfolios' expenses, the asset flows may adversely affect performance by

requiring the portfolios to purchase or sell securities at inopportune times;
otherwise limiting the sub-adviser's ability to fully implement the portfolios' investment strategies; or
requiring the portfolios to hold a larger portion of their assets in highly liquid securities than they otherwise would hold.

	Before you allocate to these subaccounts, you should consider the impact the formula will have on each portfolio's risk profile, expenses and performance. Please see the prospectus for more information and work with your financial professional to determine which portfolios are appropriate for you.

	 

What else do I need to consider with the pro-growth fee structure?

Premier Investment was built with an innovative pro-growth fee structure. While most traditional variable annuities (VAs) assess insurance charges daily based on account value, the insurance charge for the Premier Investment is assessed partially on account value and partially on cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals). When we refer to the “pro-growth” charge structure, we are illustrating that when compared to most traditional VAs, any growth in your account value will result in an overall insurance charge that represents a smaller percentage of account value (a lower “effective charge”). This is because the portion of the charge based on cumulative purchase payments remains constant. Conversely, if your account value were to decline below cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals), this would result in a higher effective charge.

Prudential Financial, Inc. announces first quarter 2017 results


Click here to download the full PDF
 

Net income attributable to Prudential Financial of $1.369 billion or $3.09 per Common share versus $1.336 billion or $2.93 per share for year-ago quarter.
After-tax adjusted operating income of $1.237 billion or $2.79 per Common share versus $997 million or $2.18 per share for year-ago quarter.
Significant items: in 1Q:17, net income and adjusted operating income include a net benefit of 3 cents per Common share, and in 1Q:16, net income and adjusted operating income included a net charge of 8 cents per share, from items discussed later in this release.
In addition, current quarter expenses reflect the impact of modifications of certain provisions within our long-term compensation program that changes the timing of expense recognition, resulting in a pre-tax expense of approximately $80 million, or 12 cents per Common share, which would have previously been recognized over the remaining three quarters of the year.


FIRST QUARTER BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  

International Insurance constant dollar basis sales of $825 million, up 8% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting increases in sales in Japan and other key markets. Life Planner count at March 31, up 3% from a year earlier, including an increase of 8% in Japan.
Higher Individual Annuities net fees and return on assets compared to the year-ago quarter reflect higher separate account balances and the benefits of refinements implemented in 2016 to the risk management approach for product guarantees. Consistent with industry trends, gross sales of $1.4 billion were below the prior year total of $2.0 billion.
Record-high Retirement account values of $395.5 billion at March 31, up 6% from a year earlier.

Unaffiliated third party net inflows, excluding money market, totaled $600 million for the current quarter.
U.S. Individual Life sales, based on annualized new business premiums, of $146 million consistent with the year-ago quarter.

SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN THE QUARTER

Net income and adjusted operating income each include a pre-tax benefit of $19 million in Individual Annuities to reflect the impact of market performance on deferred policy acquisition and other costs and reserves for guaranteed minimum benefits, with a favorable impact of approximately 3 cents per Common share.
In the year-ago quarter, net income and adjusted operating income each included a charge of 8 cents per Common share reflecting the impact of market performance on Individual Annuities results.
In addition, net income and adjusted operating income each include a pre-tax expense of approximately $80 million, or 12 cents per Common share, related to modifications of certain provisions within our long-term compensation program. These modifications require us to recognize expenses of certain 2017 plan awards in the current quarter which would previously have been recognized over the remaining three quarters of the year. 

 
NEWARK, N.J. – Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU) today reported first quarter results. Net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc., was $1.369 billion ($3.09 per Common share) for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.336 billion ($2.93 per Common share) for the first quarter of 2016. After-tax adjusted operating income was $1.237 billion ($2.79 per Common share) for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $997 million ($2.18 per Common share) for the first quarter of 2016. Information regarding adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, is provided below.

Adjusted operating income does not equate to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, but is the measure used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources, and is the measure of segment performance presented below. Consolidated adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance. Adjusted book value is a non-GAAP measure of financial position. These measures are discussed later in this press release under “Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures.” Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the tables that accompany this release.
 
RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONS
The Company’s ongoing operations include the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and International Insurance divisions, as well as Corporate and Other Operations. In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results.

The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division reported adjusted operating income of $1.061 billion for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $712 million in the year-ago quarter.


 
The Individual Annuities segment reported adjusted operating income of $468 million in the current quarter, compared to $328 million in the year-ago quarter. Current quarter results include a benefit of $19 million, and results for the year-ago quarter included a net charge of $53 million, in each case reflecting an updated estimate of profitability for this business driven by market performance in relation to our assumptions. Excluding the effect of the foregoing items, results for the Individual Annuities segment increased $68 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects higher policy fees net of associated risk management and other related costs, driven by an increase in average variable annuity account values, and efficiencies from recently implemented refinements in risk management strategies relative to contract guarantees. In addition, results benefited from a greater contribution from net investment results, which included current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees that were approximately $15 million above our average expectations, as compared to returns modestly below our average expectations in the year-ago quarter.


 
The Retirement segment reported adjusted operating income of $397 million for the current quarter, compared to $219 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects greater contributions from net investment results and case experience, as well as higher fee income, driven by growth in average account values. The contribution from net investment results was $135 million above the year-ago quarter, reflecting current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $65 million above our average expectations in comparison to returns about $40 million below our average expectations in the year-ago quarter, as well as growth of spread-based account values. The current quarter contribution to results from case experience was approximately $50 million above our average quarterly expectations as compared to $20 million above our quarterly expectations in the year-ago quarter. 


 
The Asset Management segment reported adjusted operating income of $196 million for the current quarter, compared to $165 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher asset management fees reflecting growth in fixed income assets under management and fee rate modifications within certain real estate funds. In addition, results reflected a $7 million higher contribution from the segment’s incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage activities, which amounted to $29 million for the current quarter. These increases were partially offset by higher net expenses, including approximately $25 million from changes made to our long-term compensation program as described above.

The U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division reported adjusted operating income of $152 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $146 million in the year-ago quarter.


 
The Individual Life segment reported adjusted operating income of $118 million for the current quarter, compared to $120 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects higher expenses and more unfavorable claims experience, partly offset by a greater contribution from net investment results. The net contribution to current quarter results from claims experience, inclusive of reinsurance, associated reserve updates and amortization, was approximately $50 million below our average expectations. In comparison, the year-ago quarter contribution was approximately $35 million below our average expectations. The current quarter contribution from net investment results reflected returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees about $15 million above our average expectations in comparison to returns about $10 million below our average expectations in the year-ago quarter.


 
The Group Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $34 million in the current quarter, compared to $26 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects a greater contribution from net investment results, partly offset by less favorable underwriting results and higher expenses. The current quarter contribution from net investment results included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees approximately $15 million above our average expectations in comparison to returns about $10 million below our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. 

The International Insurance segment reported adjusted operating income of $799 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $779 million in the year-ago quarter. 


 
Adjusted operating income of the segment’s Life Planner operations was $408 million for the current quarter, compared to $410 million in the year-ago quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of the Company’s currency hedging programs, had an unfavorable impact of $13 million in comparison to the year-ago quarter. Excluding this impact, results increased $11 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven by continued business growth partially offset by less favorable policy benefits experience. The contribution to current quarter earnings from claims experience was approximately $15 million less than our average expectations as compared to claims experience essentially consistent with our average expectations in the year-ago quarter. The current quarter contribution from net investment results was essentially unchanged from the year-ago quarter and included returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees approximately $10 million above our average expectations in comparison to returns slightly below our average expectations in the year-ago quarter.


 
Adjusted operating income of the segment’s Gibraltar Life and Other operations was $391 million for the current quarter, compared to $369 million in the year-ago quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of the Company’s currency hedging programs, had an unfavorable impact of $2 million in comparison to the year-ago quarter. Excluding this impact, results increased $24 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven by business growth, including a full quarter’s contribution from the Company’s indirect investment in AFP Habitat acquired on March 2, 2016, and a greater contribution from net investment results, partly offset by less favorable policy benefits experience. The contribution from net investment results included current quarter returns on non-coupon investments and prepayment fees modestly above our average expectations in comparison to returns about $20 million below average expectations in the year-ago quarter. Claims experience was about $10 million less favorable than our average expectations in the quarter, as compared to claims experience that was slightly more favorable than our average expectations in the year-ago quarter.

Corporate and Other operations resulted in a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $352 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a loss of $312 million in the year-ago quarter. 


 
The increased loss came primarily from higher net expenses, including approximately $25 million from changes made to our long-term compensation program in the current quarter as described above, partly offset by lower net interest expense and a higher contribution from net investment income. 
 
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT
Assets under management amounted to $1.299 trillion at March 31, 2017, compared to $1.264 trillion at December 31, 2016.  

 
NET INCOME AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. amounted to $1.369 billion for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.336 billion for the year-ago quarter.

Current quarter net income includes $38 million of pre-tax net realized investment gains and related charges and adjustments. The foregoing gains include pre-tax gains of $180 million from general portfolio and related activities and $48 million from products that contain embedded derivatives or guarantees and associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risks of these products. The foregoing gains were partially offset by pre-tax losses of $171 million primarily related to derivatives used in risk management activities including foreign currency and asset and liability duration management and $19 million from impairments and sales of credit-impaired investments.

Net income for the current quarter reflects pre-tax increases of $44 million in recorded asset values and $12 million in recorded liabilities representing changes in value which are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. These changes primarily represent mark-to-market adjustments.

Net income for the current quarter also reflects pre-tax income of $40 million from divested businesses, primarily reflecting results from the Closed Block division.

Net income for the year-ago quarter included $338 million of pre-tax net realized investment gains and related charges and adjustments, including pre-tax gains of $282 million from products that contain embedded derivatives and associated derivative portfolios that are part of a hedging program related to the risks of these products and $168 million primarily related to derivatives used in risk management activities including asset and liability duration management. The foregoing gains were partly offset by pre-tax losses of $106 million from impairments and sales of credit-impaired investments and $6 million from the impact of other general portfolio and related activities. 
Excluding holdings of the Closed Block division, gross unrealized losses on general account fixed maturity investments at March 31, 2017, amounted to $3.554 billion, including $3.287 billion on high and highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent ratings, and amounted to $3.809 billion at December 31, 2016. Net unrealized gains on these investments amounted to $26.822 billion at March 31, 2017, compared to $27.585 billion at December 31, 2016.
 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES
Certain of the statements included in this release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “includes,” “plans,” “assumes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “intends,” “should,” “will,” “shall,” or variations of such words are generally part of forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries will be those anticipated by management. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including, among others: (1) general economic, market and political conditions, including the performance and fluctuations of fixed income, equity, real estate and other financial markets; (2) the availability and cost of additional debt or equity capital or external financing for our operations; (3) interest rate fluctuations or prolonged periods of low interest rates; (4) the degree to which we choose not to hedge risks, or the potential ineffectiveness or insufficiency of hedging or risk management strategies we do implement; (5) any inability to access our credit facilities; (6) reestimates of our reserves for future policy benefits and claims; (7) differences between actual experience regarding mortality, morbidity, persistency, utilization, interest rates or market returns and the assumptions we use in pricing our products, establishing liabilities and reserves or for other purposes; (8) changes in our assumptions related to deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired or goodwill; (9) changes in assumptions for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans; (10) changes in our financial strength or credit ratings; (11) statutory reserve requirements associated with term and universal life insurance policies under Regulation XXX, Guideline AXXX and principles-based reserving requirements; (12) investment losses, defaults and counterparty non-performance; (13) competition in our product lines and for personnel; (14) difficulties in marketing and distributing products through current or future distribution channels; (15) changes in tax law; (16) economic, political, currency and other risks relating to our international operations; (17) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign securities markets; (18) regulatory or legislative changes, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the U.S. Department of Labor’s fiduciary rules; (19) inability to protect our intellectual property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others; (20) adverse determinations in litigation or regulatory matters, and our exposure to contingent liabilities, including related to the remediation of certain securities lending activities administered by the Company; (21) domestic or international military actions, natural or man-made disasters including terrorist activities or pandemic disease, or other events resulting in catastrophic loss of life; (22) ineffectiveness of risk management policies and procedures in identifying, monitoring and managing risks; (23) possible difficulties in executing, integrating and realizing projected results of acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings; (24) interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other operational systems or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data on such systems; (25) changes in accounting principles, practices or policies; and (26) Prudential Financial, Inc.’s primary reliance, as a holding company, on dividends or distributions from its subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends or distributions in light of our ratings objectives and/or applicable regulatory restrictions. Prudential Financial, Inc. does not intend, and is under no obligation, to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document. 

Consolidated adjusted operating income and adjusted book value are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this release. 

Adjusted operating income excludes “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.

Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. However, the effectiveness of our hedging program will ultimately be reflected in adjusted operating income over time. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are classified as other trading account assets.

Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. In addition, adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Discontinued operations and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, each of which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP, are also excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable IRS and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.

Adjusted book value is calculated as total equity (GAAP book value) excluding both accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the cumulative effect of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurements and currency translation adjustments corresponding to realized investment gains and losses. These items are excluded in order to highlight the book value attributable to our core business operations separate from the portion attributable to external and potentially volatile capital and currency market conditions.

We believe that our use of these non-GAAP measures helps investors understand and evaluate the Company’s performance and financial position. The presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described above. Adjusted book value augments the understanding of our financial position by providing a measure of net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations separate from the portion that is affected by capital and currency market conditions and by isolating the accounting impact associated with insurance liabilities that are generally not marked to market and the supporting investments that are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income under GAAP. However, adjusted operating income and adjusted book value are not substitutes for income and equity determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive these measures are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial position. The schedules accompanying this release provide a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to income from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation of adjusted book value to GAAP book value.  
The information referred to above, as well as the risks of our businesses described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, should be considered by readers when reviewing forward-looking statements contained in this release. Additional historic information relating to our financial performance is located on our Web site at www.investor.prudential.com.

��CODE OF ETHICS��

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND  PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS  � I. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code  � This code of ethics (the �Code�) is established for each fund listed on Attachment A hereto (each a �Fund� and together the �Funds�) pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules adopted
thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (�SEC�). The Code applies to each Fund�s Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer or Controller, or senior officers performing
similar functions (the �Covered Officers� each of whom are set forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:  �


�
�
�
honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;  �


�
�
�
full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by a
Fund;  �


�
�
�
compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;  �


�
�
�
the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and  �


�
�
�
accountability for adherence to the Code.  � Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts
of interest.  � II. Conflicts of Interest  � A �conflict of interest� occurs when a Covered Officer�s private interest
interferes with the interests of, or his service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with a Fund.  � Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Covered Officers and a
Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the �Advisers Act�). For example, Covered
Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with a Fund because of their status as �affiliated persons� of the Fund. A Fund�s and its investment
adviser�s compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall
outside of the parameters of this Code.  � Although typically not presenting an
opportunity for improper personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationships between a Fund and the Fund�s investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, or other service providers to the Fund
(together �Service Providers�), of which the Covered Officers may also be principals or employees. As a 




result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for a Service Provider, or
for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on such Service Providers and a Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual
relationships between a Fund and its Service Providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act,
such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds� Board of Directors/Trustees (�Boards�) that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.  � Other conflicts of
interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep
in mind that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of a Fund.  � Each Covered Officer must:  �


�
�
�
not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by a Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
personally to the detriment of the Fund;  �


�
�
�
not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit the Fund; and 
�


�
�
�
not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of a Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith.
 � There are some actual or potential conflict of interest
situations that should always be brought to the attention of, and discussed with, the Funds� Chief Legal Officer or other senior legal officer, if material. Examples of these include:  �


�
�
�
service as a director on the board of any public or private company;  �


�
�
�
the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;  �


�
�
�
the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost,
appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;  �


�
�
�
any ownership interest in (other than insubstantial interests in publicly traded entities), or any consulting or employment relationship with, any of a Fund�s Service
Providers, other than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof; and  �


�
�
�
a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
than an interest arising from the Covered Officer�s employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.  �
2 


III. Disclosure and Compliance  � Each Covered Officer:  �


�
�
�
should familiarize himself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;  �


�
�
�
should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund�s Board of
Directors/Trustees and its auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;  �


�
�
�
should, to the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of a Fund and its Service Providers with the goal of promoting full,
fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Fund; and  �


�
�
�
is responsible to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.  � IV. Reporting and Accountability  � Each Covered Officer must:  �


�
�
�
upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board of Directors/Trustees that he has received, read, and
understands the Code;  �


�
�
�
annually thereafter affirm to the Board of Directors/Trustees that he has complied with the requirements of the Code; and  �


�
�
�
notify the Funds� Chief Legal Officer promptly if he knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.  � The Funds� Chief Legal Officer is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. In such situations, the Chief Legal Officer is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with counsel to the Funds, counsel
to the Independent Directors/Trustees, a Board Committee comprised of Independent Directors/Trustees, or the full Board.  � The Funds will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code:  �


�
�
�
the Funds Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential violations reported to her;  �


�
�
�
if, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer believes that no violation has occurred, the Chief Legal Officer is not required to take any further action;
 �


�
�
�
any matter that the Chief Legal Officer believes is a violation or that the Chief Legal Officer believes should be reviewed by a Fund�s Board or Board Committee comprised of
Independent Directors/Trustees will be reported to the Fund�s Board or Board Committee comprised of Independent Directors/Trustees; 




�
�
�
based upon its review of any matter referred to it, a Fund�s Board or Board Committee comprised of Independent Directors/Trustees shall determine whether or not a violation has
occurred, whether a grant of waiver is appropriate or whether some other action should be taken. Based upon its determination, the Fund�s Board or Board Committee comprised of Independent Directors/Trustees may take such action as it deems
appropriate, which may include without limitation: modifications of applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund�s investment adviser, principal underwriter or administrator, or their boards;
notification to other Funds for which the Covered Officer serves as a Covered Officer; or recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer; and  �


�
�
�
any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.  � V. Other Policies and Procedures  � This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes of Section 406
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other policies or procedures of a Fund or its Service Providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the
Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds� and their investment adviser�s and principal underwriter�s code
of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.  � VI. Amendments  � Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees.  � VII. Confidentiality  � All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund Board of Directors/Trustees, counsel to the Fund, and counsel to the Fund Independent Directors/Trustees.  � VIII. Internal Use  � The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of a Fund, as to any
fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.  � IX. Recordkeeping 
� A Fund shall keep the information disclosed about waivers and amendments
under the Code for the period of time as specified in the rules adopted pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and furnish such information to the SEC or its staff upon request.  � Adopted and approved as of September 3, 2003.  �

How much money do you think you might need when you retire?
Tell us your current age and how old you think you'll be when you retire.


 Current age 



 Retirement age 




Enter a number to guess your total.
 Your guess

 How long might that last?  



 Back 





How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
