 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYHome / EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




NORTHERN MINERALS & EXPLORATION LTD
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 
The Company:
Northern Minerals & Exploration Ltd. (“NMEX” or the “Company”) is an emerging natural resource company dedicated to building shareholder value through cash flow from oil and gas production in central Texas and exploration for gold and silver on the Winnemucca Mountain property in northern Nevada.
Corporate Background:
NMEX was incorporated on December 11, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Its fiscal year end is July 31st,, is a reporting entity to the Securities Exchange Commission and is current in its quarterly and audited filings. The Company had a name change and share consolidation of 10 for 1 in August 2013.
 
Corporate Oil and Gas Strategy:
Management’s strategy is to take advantage of the recent downturn in oil and gas prices by acquiring properties with established production and upside potential for improvement in production. We believe the best way for us to generate value is to grow the business by identifying, acquiring and developing resource properties/projects in known producing areas within our niche operating area. Management’s strategy includes but is not limited to the following:

Establish a solid cash flow foundation from low risk oil and gas projects.
Place into production existing wells on leases acquired.
Seek additional leases and/or drilling prospects with low risk preferably with in-field drilling.
Purchase existing production with un-drilled locations.
Pursue strategic acquisitions with significant oil & gas potential to joint venture and/or market.

 
Management’s niche area of operations is central Texas where its team has over 50 years’ experience in drilling,completing, acquiring and operating oil and gas wells. Our team is focused on taking a very conservative approach in its initial stages of development to build a solid positive cash flow.
 
Summary of Oil & Gas Projects:
Coleman County, Texas – Three well rework/recompletion project:
In October, 2014 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 75% working interest (56.25% Net Revenue Interest) in the J.E. Richey lease. The J.E Richey lease is located in a very prolific multiple pay area originally discovered by ARCO in the early 1980’s. This lease area has six known productive formations within the immediate area. This lease offers a conservative approach to building oil and gas production through re-working and re- completing existing wells coupled with spacing allowable for new drilling of 2 or more wells.
The existing three wells on the lease are fully equipped with downhole pumps, rods, tubing, pump jacks, well head and surface equipment including flow lines, production tanks, meter connections and gas gathering pipelines of particular interest on this lease is the Concho Richey #1 well which is located due west of the Olympia Hale #1 well that has produced more than 65,000 BBLS and over 160 MMCFG from the Gray formation.  The Gray formation has not been opened in the Concho Richey well and its log characteristics are very similar to those of the Olympia Hale well.
In March, 2015 the Company entered into an agreement to sell a 37.5% (28.125% NRI) working interest in the 3 wells on the lease for $180,000. The funds are to be used towards the turnkey costs of placing the three wells into production
In May 2015 the Company commenced reworking the J. E. Richey #1 & #3 wells. The following photos were taken of the work being conducted on the J.E. Richey #1 & 3 wells.
The reworking of the J.E. Richey #1 & 3 wells has been completed and these wells are set for production. Work on the third well, the Concho Richey #1 is scheduled for the first week of June, 2015. Upon completion of the work on the Concho Richey #1, the company will start producing these three oil and gas wells into the production tanks and gas gathering pipelines on the lease.
Callahan County, Texas – Shallow Oil Project:
In July, 2014 the Company acquired a 75% working interest (52.5% Net Revenue Interest) in the Isenhower lease. The Isenhower lease has three fully equipped wells completed in the Cook Sandstone at approximately 500 feet. The lease also has one approved water injection well and eight (8) potential undrilled locations. Recent activity on the adjoining leases has renewed the interest in placing the wells back into production. The offsetting leases on the north and west sides of the lease have had 25 new wells drilled on it within the past year to complement the existing wells on those leases. This activity on the adjoining leases is part of a petroleum engineered re-pressuring water-flood program. The target for the re-pressuring water-flood program is the Cook Sandstone which is noted to have excellent porosity and permeability. Our lease is poised in an excellent position to receive benefit from the re-pressuring of the Cook Sandstone by theoperator on the adjoining leases to the north and west sides of our leased acreage. This re-pressuring may significantly improve the production rates on the lease which could have a dramatic effect on the revenues generated from the existing wells and any new wells drilled on our lease. The Company’s plan is to re-work all three of the wells to place them back into production and drill new wells to fully develop the acreage.
Callahan County, Texas – Mississippi Reef Project:
In July, 2014 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a 60% working interest, (45% net Revenue Interest) in the J. Morgan lease. The J. Morgan lease is located in an area with multiple formations that are known to be oil & gas productive. Of particular interest are the recent Mississippi Reef discoveries in the area. A number of notable Mississippi Reef discoveries have been located using 2D seismic in this area. One of these Mississippi Reef discoveries has produced over 128,000 barrels of oil and 140 MMCF of natural gas in less than 10 years. A 2D seismic survey has been conducted covering the leased acreage reflecting an anomaly of interest.
While the Mississippi Reef is the primary target there are four other productive formations known to produce in the immediate area of the acreage and the possibility of three other formations that are also known to produce in the area. Of particular interest is the Cross Cut formation which was productive on the east side of the lease and could have potential on other parts of the acreage.
Winnemucca Mountain Gold Property

The Winnemucca Mountain Property (the “Property’) consists of a total 208 unpatented mineral claims in Humboldt County, in northwestern Nevada. Humboldt County is the second largest gold producing county in the United States and hosts numerous past and producing gold mines, including the Getchell (Barrick/Newmont), Marigold (Goldcorp), Lone Tree (Newmont), and Twin Creeks (Newmont). The Property is located about 25 km northwest of the Lone Tree Mine and 30 km southeast of the historic Sleeper open pit mine operated by Amax Gold from 1986 to 1996. Recent exploration at Sleeper has identified an additional resource of over 5 Million ounces of gold and in excess of 60 million ounces of silver.
The Property is located near the northern end of the highly productive Battle Mountain-Eureka mineral trend, and is underlain by Triassic sediments cut by several phases of Cretaceous and Tertiary intrusive and volcanic rocks. Previous exploration on the Winnemucca Mountain Property conducted by Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp. (now Newmont Mining) between 1988 and 1990, focused on the pediment covered Swordfish zone. Gold mineralization in the Swordfish zone occurs within a northeast trending, low sulfide quartz vein system that extends approximately 670 meters (2,200 feet) along the western flank of claim block. Santa Fe conducted geological mapping, rock sampling, trenching, CSAMT and induced polarization geophysical surveys, collected 286 auger hole bedrock samples, and completed a total of 18,260 meters (52,470.8 feet) in 73 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes, nearly all of which were focused on the Swordfish zone and reported results ranging up to 13.7 m averaging 3.9 g per tonne gold (45 feet averaging 0.137 opt gold). Near the end of Santa Fe’s tenure on the Property, a step-out hole 500 meters (1600 feet) to the northeast of the swordfish zone encountered 69 g/t gold (2.2 opt gold) across 1.5 meters (5 feet) at what is known as the ‘SF Extension’.
This intercept was never followed up on by Santa Fe who relinquished their interest in the Property shortly thereafter.Management considers the untested and pediment covered 500-meter strike between the Swordfish Zone and SF Extension to be a high priority drill target, as well as investigating other areas beyond.In addition to the Swordfish and SF Extension areas, additional exploration targets have been identified and are comprised of multiple outcropping vein-type occurrences reported to carry anomalous gold values that have yet to be explored in detail. Exploration conducted in 1996, which included an induced polarization (IP) survey, is thought to have delineated two new target zones that correlate well with known mineralized areas.
Initial exploration completed by Northern Minerals and Exploration (“Northern”) including geologic mapping, rock sampling and geochemical exploration has shown a series of steeply dipping quartz veins outcroppings which appear to be associated with a major northeast trending, gold-bearing shear zone that is several hundred feet wide and 3,000-5,000 feet in length in the Swordfish Target area on Winnemucca Mountain. Indicating that the total strike length at the Swordfish Target is potentially significantly longer than the 2,200 feet previously outlined by Santa Fe Pacific in the 1990’s.
Results from the Northern’s initial phase of the exploration on the Winnemucca Mountain Property have been combined with available historic data to construct 3D modeling of the potential resource target area and to determine an ideal drilling strategy.
Winnemucca Mountain Property Summary
The Winnemucca Mountain Property covers 3800 acres and is located in an area of numerous past and current gold mines. Two of the most significant are the Sleeper and Hycroft mines, both of which produced over one million ounces of gold during operations from the late 1980’s to the late 1990’s. Both mines are located to the west of Winnemucca Mountain.
Gold and silver were first discovered in the Winnemucca Mining District in 1863, and during the 1860’s several smelters were constructed in the area. Modern exploration began in the 1980’s with mapping, geochemical sampling, geophysics and drilling conducted by several companies including St. Joe, Cordex, Tenneco, and Sante Fe Pacific Gold. By the mid-1990’s over 52,000 feet of drilling had been completed. A large percentage of this drilling was done in the Swordfish Target which is currently being evaluated by the company as a potentially minable deposit. Northern is planning further exploration on the Winnemucca Mountain property with the focus of defining the potential of one million plus ounces of gold equivalent on the Property.
Northern Minerals and Exploration Ltd. currently holds an option to acquire an 80% interest in the Winnemucca Mountain Property.

Rare Earths


What are rare earths?
Rare earths play an important and growing role in our modern society despite being a relatively unknown group of elements. Hybrid vehicles, energy efficient lighting and wind turbines are among the the applications in which rare earths are critical.
Rare earths belong to the lanthanide series of elements with most only discovered in the last 120 years. Rare earths are more common than gold in the earth’s crust. The “rare” title comes from the limited economic abundance and from the complexity of extraction and processing.

				In 2009, following positive geological results and increasing demand for HREs, resources were committed to HRE exploration and development.			






Company History


Northern Minerals listed on the ASX in November 2006 as Northern Uranium. It was created by its two shareholders, Washington Resources and Polaris Metals, to be a uranium focussed mineral exploration company. The Company’s flagship asset was the Gardiner-Tanami Project, in northern Australia on the WA and NT border, which it was developing through a strategic alliance with global nuclear leader Areva.
In 2009, a reconnaissance program returned significant results for rare earths, in particular, heavy rare earths (HRE) such as dysprosium. With the positive geological results and increasing HRE prices, the Company committed resources to the exploration and development of HRE.
In 2010, Northern Minerals increased its focus on HRE, expanding its portfolio with a number of tenement acquisitions, and commenced a ground based HRE-targeted reconnaissance program across Browns Range. Reflecting this change, the Company changed its name in early 2011 from Northern Uranium to Northern Minerals.
The first HRE drill results from Browns Range were received in 2011, confirming four exciting prospects of xenotime mineralisation, with high value dysprosium. Further exploration across the area identified the deposits were part of a significant geological structure known as the Browns Range Dome, with a number of other exploration targets also identified.
In late 2012, following highly successful drill campaigns, Northern Minerals announced the Browns Range Project’s (the Project) maiden JORC HRE resource, and to date this resource has increased by 400%. During this same period, Northern Minerals announced it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding for an offtake agreement with global materials company Sumitomo Corporation.
Northern Minerals has since continued the Project along its pathway to production through the completion of the Project’s Pre-feasibility Study and Definitive Feasibility Study in 2014 and 2015, respectively. During this time Northern Minerals also made significant progression in respect to the Project’s approvals with the signing of a Co-existence Agreement with the Traditional Owners, the Jaru People, and granting of the Project’s primary environmental approval and mining lease.
In 2016, the Company is working on its new business plan to bring the Project into production. The plan, which separates the Project’s development into three stages, allows Northern Minerals to test, through a pilot plant, the Project and market, develop the Project to bankable feasibility study level and then build the full scale operation.

Rare Earths


Powering Technology
Rare earths play a vital role in powering clean energy and the manufacturing of high technology solutions. Belonging to the lanthanide series of elements on the periodic table, most of these were discovered in the last 120 years. Rare earths are broadly divided in to light and heavy. This distinction is important as each varies greatly in terms of natural occurrence, end-use applications and supply/demand drivers. The Browns Range Project is abundant in heavy rare earths, in particular the high value element of dysprosium.

 Browns Range
Boulder Ridge
John Galt


				Boulder Ridge is located in the Tanami region of the Northern Territory. Rock chip sampling at the site has identified some outstanding grades of HRE, reinforcing the significant growth potential of the region. 			






Boulder Ridge



Boulder Ridge is located on a 100% NTU owned tenement (EL29594) in the Tanami region of the Northern Territory, about 100km south east of the Browns Range Project. It is part of a tenement package which includes most of the eastern section of the Browns Range Dome, and extends southward toward the Tanami Gold mine. The tenements are contiguous with the Browns Range HRE project tenements.
Historical exploration activity at Boulder Ridge from the 1970s and 1980s has identified high grades of total rare earth oxides (TREO) from rock chip samples. The samples indicate xenotime mineralisation within quartz veins hosted by silicified and brecciated sandstone.

Northern Minerals’ first pass reconnaissance geological mapping and rock chip sampling was completed at Boulder Ridge in September 2013. Target areas for on-ground follow-up were identified from a review of historical exploration data, plus an interpretation of the area based on airborne geophysical survey data. The rock chip sampling program was not systematic over the area, but was selective in nature, in order to obtain an indication of mineralisation.
The results of the rock chip sampling included some outstanding, high-grade assay results of greater than 12% TREO. They also featured a dominance of heavy rare earths (HREs), with up to 99% of the Total Rare Earth Oxide (TREO) being high value HRE. Of the 19 samples collected from the prospect, 17 had a TREO grade above 1% including up to 1.15% dysprosium oxide, with xenotime mineralisation observed in several places. Soil sampling, further rock  chip sampling and portable XRF surveys have subsequently been completed, which have confirmed the high-grade nature of the HRE mineralisation. In addition a high-resolution airborne magnetics and radiometrics survey has been completed which has highlighted further targets for on-ground follow-up.
The results to date reinforce the significant exploration potential of the Browns Range and Tanami regions which remain largely untested for xenotime-hosted HRE mineralisation. Further work will be focused on drill testing the initial targets at Boulder Ridge as well as continuing to define further new drill targets.
 
Competent persons statement
The information in this report that relates to Exploration Results or Exploration Targets for the Boulder Ridge Project is based on information compiled by Mr Robin Wilson, a full-time employee of Northern Minerals, a Competent Person, who is a member of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Robin Wilson has sufficient experience which is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he is undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the “Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves”. Mr Wilson consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears.

 Overview
Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve

Licence to Operate


				The flowsheet has the ability to deliver superior recoveries to produce a high purity, dysprosium rich, mixed RE carbonate.			






Processing


The ore will be processed through a beneficiation and hydrometallurgical facility collocated on site to produce a high purity, dysprosium rich, mixed RE carbonate for export.
The xenotime mineralisation found at Browns Range is rich in dysprosium and other high value heavy rare earth oxides2 (HREO). The xenotime, in combination with the mainly silica host rock, allows the ore to be upgraded, up to 30 times through the beneficiation process with excellent recoveries. This recovery and upgrade ratio has resulted in a competitive pre-production capital cost estimate.
Stage one: test
The pilot plant will consist of all the processing steps detailed in the Project’s Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) and in stage three below. However, the plant will be downsized to a capacity to process 60,000tpa of ore at 1.19% total rare earth oxides1 (TREO) through the beneficiation plant, and 3,200tpa of xenotime concentrate at 20% TREO through the hydrometallurgical process. The final product will contain 49,000kg dysprosium in 590,000kg TREO within a mixed RE carbonate per annum.
The pilot plant will be modularised and containerised where possible, to facilitate a compressed site construction period and allow it to be transported to undertake testwork at other projects if required.
Stage two: develop
Produce a premium product
Significant opportunity exists to reduce downstream solvent extraction (SX) separation costs, by separating yttrium in the hydrometallurgical process.
Removing approximately 90% of the yttrium results in less mixed RE carbonate being produced, and less material required to be processed through the downstream SX separation process.
With current market signals indicating that sale of the yttrium oxide is likely to be limited for the foreseeable future, this step will increase the percentage of the dysprosium in the mixed RE carbonate product from 9% Dy/TREO to around 20% Dy/TREO.
Completion of initial testwork at ANSTO Minerals has indicated that removal of yttrium, lanthanum and cerium can be achieved through a relatively simple addition to the hydrometallurgical process. Any further studies will progress in line with funding.
Stage three: full scale  
Beneficiation plant
The full scale beneficiation plant will process 585,000tpa of ore to produce a high grade mineral concentrate to feed into the hydrometallurgical plant. The process consists of:

a crushing and grinding circuit; and
a combination of wet high gradient magnetic separation, and flotation.

The overall beneficiation circuit delivers outstanding recoveries of 91% dysprosium and 87% TREO at a 20% TREO mineral concentrate grade.
Hydrometallurgical plant
The proposed hydrometallurgical plant will use conventional unit processes to treat 16,700tpa of mineral concentrate from the beneficiation plant. The hydrometallurgical plant processes include:

sulphation bake followed by water leach;
purification of the leach liquor to remove deleterious elements; and
carbonate precipitation step to precipitate a mixed RE carbonate.

The hydrometallurgical plant will produce 279,000kg of dysprosium contained with 3,127,000kg of TREO, in 6,000,000kg of mixed RE carbonate per annum.
These processes and the final production numbers do not take into account the yttrium rejection test work and flowsheet development to be completed during stage two.
Mixed RE carbonate
Following feedback from a number of potential offtake partners and toll-separators, Northern Minerals will produce a mixed RE carbonate which is the preferred feedstock for downstream processing by SX.
¹TREO = Total Rare Earth Oxides – La2O3, CeO2, Pr6O11, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb4O7, Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, Y2O3
²HREO = Heavy Rare Earth Oxides – Total of Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb4O7, Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3, Lu2O3, Y2O3 





Testwork
A significant amount of testwork has been undertaken for both the beneficiation and hydrometallurgical process flowsheets.
In addition to bench scale testwork in 2012 and 2013, Northern Minerals completed a successful beneficiation pilot plant campaign in early 2014, with three bulk samples totalling 90t producing 2,200kg of mineral concentrate at 20% TREO grade.
The pilot results, combined with bench scale testwork, delivered significant improvements in HREO recovery up to 90% for a 20% TREO mineral concentrate, and reinforced the significant processing advantages of the Browns Range xenotime mineralisation.
During the pilot run, testwork was also undertaken by external suppliers on thickening, filtration, viscosity and material handling. The mineral concentrate produced during the beneficiation pilot plant was used for the hydrometallurgical bench scale and pilot plant testwork at ANSTO Minerals in early 2014.
Northern Minerals and ANSTO conducted three five day continuous hydrometallurgical pilot plant campaigns with the final run being completed in June 2014. The proposed flowsheet achieved a 92% dysprosium and an overall 92.6% TREO recovery under the continuous pilot plant conditions. The grade of mixed RE carbonate produced typically contained 48% TREO.
The hydrometallurgical pilot plant testwork achieved a number of exceptional results in particular the simple and robust acid concentrate mixing and kiln operation, which displayed none of the apparent material handling issues that have been problematic for other rare earth monazite, bastnaesite and apatite concentrates. In addition, the low concentration of the deleterious elements, such as thorium and uranium, in the rare earth carbonate concentrate produced, makes the product suitable for downstream processing.
Similar to the beneficiation pilot plant, external contractors were engaged during the pilot plant campaigns to conduct testwork in order to gather engineering data for detailed design. These were thickening, filtration, materials handling and waste gas treatment vendors.
The pilot plant in stage one will continue on from this testwork and allow Northern Minerals to test the process and to further de-risk the development of the full scale operation by allowing it to test a number of process flowsheet variables that cannot be replicated in a laboratory.

				Ancillary infrastructure such as an accommodation village, mine offices and an airstrip will be constructed on site to support operations. 			






Infrastructure



Existing ancillary infrastructure will be utilised where possible to reduce costs, and any new infrastructure significantly downsized, from the DFS, to support the reduced operational requirements of the pilot plant in stage one.
During stage three this infrastructure will either be expanded and/or replaced to support the requirements of full scale operations.
Both the pilot and full scale processing plants will be located on site.

Stage one: test 
A small purpose designed and built above ground tailings storage facility (TSF) and evaporation pond will be constructed to manage the combined tailings streams from the pilot plant.
The existing diesel generators will be utilised for the accommodation camp, however capacity will be increased to provide power for the process plant. Water will be sourced from the proven Gardiner Sandstone aquifer. The existing 20 person accommodation camp will be expanded to 40 person to support a rostered fly in, and fly out workforce.
The existing road network will be used to transport supplies and final product to and from Wyndham, and/or Darwin ports.
Stage three: build full scale
The existing downsized TSF and evaporation pond will be expanded to manage the combined trailing streams from the full scale beneficiation and hydrometallurgical plant. An onsite purpose built diesel power station will be constructed to supply power and additional water infrastructure will be installed to support an increase in water requirements.
A new accommodation village, offices and airstrip will be constructed at the Project site to support the expanded operation.
Road access will be continue to be via the Great Northern Highway to Halls Creek, then the Duncan road west to Ringer Soak via the Gordon Downs road. Access to the Project from here will be via a private access road, which will be further developed and maintained by Northern Minerals to support the increase in traffic during full scale production. To further reduce heavy and light vehicle interaction, and minimise disruption to the community, a deviation will be constructed around Ringer Soak during this stage.
The mixed RE carbonate product will be packaged in bags in 20t shipping containers and transported by road to the Port of Wyndham for export. Both product and supplies with be exported and imported from the Port of Wyndham.

				Northern Minerals is positioned to become the first significant dysprosium producer outside of China.			






Corporate


Northern Minerals  Limited  (ASX:  NTU the Company)  is  focussed  on  becoming  the first  significant producer of  the  heavy  rare  earth  (HRE),  dysprosium outside of China.  The Company has a large landholding in Western Australia (WA) and the Northern Territory (NT) that is highly prospective for this element. Its current portfolio consists of three projects, the Browns Range and John Galt projects in WA, and the Boulder Ridge Project located in the NT.
Of these projects, Northern Minerals’ 100% owned Browns Range Project (the Project) is its flagship project, where it has a number of deposits and prospects containing high value dysprosium and other HREs, hosted in xenotime mineralisation.
Dysprosium is an essential ingredient in the production of NdDyFeB (neodymium dysprosium iron-boron) magnets used in clean energy and high technology solutions. As a result of increasing global demand for these applications dysprosium supply is critical.
The xenotime’s richness in dysprosium and other high value HREs, in combination with the mainly silica host rock, provides a key competitive advantage. It allows the ore to be significantly concentrated, up to 30 times through the beneficiation stage, with excellent recoveries. Northern Minerals has undertaken extensive testwork to develop a two stage process flowsheet, consisting of a beneficiation and hydrometallurgical plant, to produce a high value, high purity dysprosium rich, mixed rare earth carbonate product for export.
The John Galt and Boulder Ridge projects are at early stages of exploration, with both displaying similar mineralisation to the Browns Range Project.

				Northern Minerals is positioned to become the first significant dysprosium producer outside of China.			






Corporate


Northern Minerals  Limited  (ASX:  NTU the Company)  is  focussed  on  becoming  the first  significant producer of  the  heavy  rare  earth  (HRE),  dysprosium outside of China.  The Company has a large landholding in Western Australia (WA) and the Northern Territory (NT) that is highly prospective for this element. Its current portfolio consists of three projects, the Browns Range and John Galt projects in WA, and the Boulder Ridge Project located in the NT.
Of these projects, Northern Minerals’ 100% owned Browns Range Project (the Project) is its flagship project, where it has a number of deposits and prospects containing high value dysprosium and other HREs, hosted in xenotime mineralisation.
Dysprosium is an essential ingredient in the production of NdDyFeB (neodymium dysprosium iron-boron) magnets used in clean energy and high technology solutions. As a result of increasing global demand for these applications dysprosium supply is critical.
The xenotime’s richness in dysprosium and other high value HREs, in combination with the mainly silica host rock, provides a key competitive advantage. It allows the ore to be significantly concentrated, up to 30 times through the beneficiation stage, with excellent recoveries. Northern Minerals has undertaken extensive testwork to develop a two stage process flowsheet, consisting of a beneficiation and hydrometallurgical plant, to produce a high value, high purity dysprosium rich, mixed rare earth carbonate product for export.
The John Galt and Boulder Ridge projects are at early stages of exploration, with both displaying similar mineralisation to the Browns Range Project.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.
