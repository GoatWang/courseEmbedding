Investment Process


		The linchpin of our process is our rigorous approach to risk management based on the fundamental tenet that preservation of capital is our first priority. We align our interests with those of our clients by investing our own capital alongside those we serve.

		Our investment process is anchored by four time-tested cornerstones:

Idea Generation

		We begin by using the breadth and depth of our industry-specific knowledge, alongside our many relationships to identify out-of-favor companies with potential catalysts for transformational change. Potential investment opportunities are found by using various value screens derived from our many years of sector specialization. Our search focuses on evaluating companies based on recurring revenues, strong cash flows, strategic importance, management team and balance sheet quality. This approach enables us to seek quality investments with attractive asymmetric risk/reward characteristics.

Independent Analysis

		Our bottom-up investment approach consists of several interlocking pieces of fundamental research and analysis. Each potential investment opportunity undergoes extensive analysis of the quality of its recurring revenue base, earnings power, financial condition, and valuation given the current and projected outlook. A strategic competitive analysis is performed to understand the company’s strengths and weaknesses, with potential catalysts/events that may unlock shareholder value identified. 

		We meet with management teams, board members, industry contacts and consultants throughout the research process and constantly reevaluate our analysis. Both the upside and downside return scenarios are modeled to fully understand the risks associated with the investment. 

Investment Discussion

		Each investment opportunity is scrutinized by the team, with a sharp focus on downside risk. We consistently ask the question, “How low can it go?”, and a “Devil’s Advocate” test is always performed to understand the risks. Optimal entry points are established after upside and downside risk targets are determined. Position sizing varies upon conviction level.

Position and Portfolio Management

		The portfolio is constantly monitored for developments that might create opportunistic trading. Comprehensive risk analysis is done that closely follows volatility, liquidity, industry exposure, incremental value at risk, correlation and beta. Diligent re-evaluations of each position can lead to adding, trimming, or exiting a stock depending on the fundamental change to the investment over time.

After seeing their commercial I decided to use Pure Gold for the first time after dealing with Apmex and Kitco over the years. This by far was the most enjoyable experience I have had with a precious metal company. My rep, Tom, spent time with me and answered every question. The whole transaction was clean and easy and Tom kept me informed throughout the process until I received the delivery. He's got a customer for life. Thank you Pure Gold Global!! P.S. I hope he doesn't get mad at me for doing this but his full name is Tom Foster. Talk to him first if you are thinking about buying precious metals.Pure Gold GlobalMiguel A. ratedJust received the latest of the two dozen or so transactions I've conducted with Pure Gold Global during the last few years. As expected, what I ordered arrive on time, and in perfect order. It seems no matter how large or small an order is, each one is treated the same way: professionally and efficiently. You guys establish the bar with regards to excellence and customer service. Thanks.Pure Gold GlobalJana J. ratedOMG! I love these guys. Freaking amazing. I've bought so much from these guys: gold, silver, old currency, containers, supplies so much more! Shipping is same day if not next day. I had one order that was 1 day late on shipping and they gave me free shipping coupon. I love how they have live chat... makes you feel safer... I recommend these guys for everything!! Pure Gold GlobalAndie J. ratedPure Gold Global has proven to be the most professional, efficient, and caring of any precious metals firm that I have had dealings with in Gold and Silver.
