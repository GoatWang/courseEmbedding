                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by UBS AG,

KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The top 10 loans comprise 62.4% of the 
      pool, which is worse than the 2015 and year-to-date (YTD) 2016 averages 
      of 49.3% and 54.5%, respectively. The pool's loan concentration index 
      (LCI) is 507, which is above the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 367 and 
      418, respectively. For this transaction, the losses estimated by Fitch's 
      deterministic test at 'AAAsf' exceeded Fitch's base modeled loss 
      estimate; therefore, Fitch's concluded loss estimate at 'AAAsf' is based 
      on Fitch's deterministic test.


                                        








Average Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are in line with 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 
      1.24x is slightly better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR of 1.20x. 
      The pool's Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 106.6% is slightly worse than 
      the YTD 2016 average Fitch LTV of 105.7%.


                                        








Property Quality: The pool's collateral exhibited above-average quality 
      with 74.4% of Fitch-inspected properties (62.0% of the pool) receiving 
      property quality grades of 'B+' or better, compared to 2016 YTD levels 
      of 50.1%. Four properties, representing 31.7% of the Fitch site 
      inspection sample and 26.4% of the pool, received a property quality 
      grade of 'A-' or better, compared to 2016 YTD levels of 18.4%. Two 
      properties, accounting for 0.8% of Fitch-inspected properties, received 
      a property quality grade of 'C'.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.1% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 
      2016-UBS12 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & Touche 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.


                                        








REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS


                                        








A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

      Fitch to Rate Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2016-UBS12; Presale Issued
    





November 14, 2016 01:42 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the Morgan Stanley Capital 
      I Trust 2016-UBS12 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$38,800,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,700,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56,000,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$190,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$237,609,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$577,109,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$132,941,000b class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50,497,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,191,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,253,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,466,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,703,000ab class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,306,000ab class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,466,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,703,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10,306,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$30,916,736ab class X-G;
    

      --$30,916,736a class G.
    

      a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 9, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 42 loans secured by 72 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $824,441,736 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by UBS AG, 
      Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, Bank of America, National 
      Association, and Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The top 10 loans comprise 62.4% of the 
      pool, which is worse than the 2015 and year-to-date (YTD) 2016 averages 
      of 49.3% and 54.5%, respectively. The pool's loan concentration index 
      (LCI) is 507, which is above the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 367 and 
      418, respectively. For this transaction, the losses estimated by Fitch's 
      deterministic test at 'AAAsf' exceeded Fitch's base modeled loss 
      estimate; therefore, Fitch's concluded loss estimate at 'AAAsf' is based 
      on Fitch's deterministic test.
    

      Average Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are in line with 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 
      1.24x is slightly better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR of 1.20x. 
      The pool's Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 106.6% is slightly worse than 
      the YTD 2016 average Fitch LTV of 105.7%.
    

      Property Quality: The pool's collateral exhibited above-average quality 
      with 74.4% of Fitch-inspected properties (62.0% of the pool) receiving 
      property quality grades of 'B+' or better, compared to 2016 YTD levels 
      of 50.1%. Four properties, representing 31.7% of the Fitch site 
      inspection sample and 26.4% of the pool, received a property quality 
      grade of 'A-' or better, compared to 2016 YTD levels of 18.4%. Two 
      properties, accounting for 0.8% of Fitch-inspected properties, received 
      a property quality grade of 'C'.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.1% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 
      2016-UBS12 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & Touche 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2016-UBS12
























CHICAGO, Dec 07, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings to the Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 
      2016-UBS12 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The top 10 loans comprise 62.4% of the 
      pool, which is worse than the 2015 and year-to-date (YTD) 2016 averages 
      of 49.3% and 54.5%, respectively. The pool's loan concentration index 
      (LCI) is 507, which is above the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 367 and 
      418, respectively. For this transaction, the losses estimated by Fitch's 
      deterministic test at 'AAAsf' exceeded Fitch's base modeled loss 
      estimate; therefore, Fitch's concluded loss estimate at 'AAAsf' is based 
      on Fitch's deterministic test.


                                        








Average Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are in line with 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 
      1.24x is slightly better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR of 1.20x. 
      The pool's Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 106.6% is slightly worse than 
      the YTD 2016 average Fitch LTV of 105.7%.


                                        








Property Quality: The pool's collateral exhibited above-average quality 
      with 74.4% of Fitch-inspected properties (62% of the pool) receiving 
      property quality grades of 'B+' or better, compared to 2016 YTD levels 
      of 50.1%. Four properties, representing 31.7% of the Fitch site 
      inspection sample and 26.4% of the pool, received a property quality 
      grade of 'A-' or better, compared to 2016 YTD levels of 18.4%. Two 
      properties, accounting for 0.8% of Fitch-inspected properties, received 
      a property quality grade of 'C'.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 9.1% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 
      2016-UBS12 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & Touche 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.


                                        








REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS


                                        








A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.

      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.


                                        








For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia
