A Sea Of SupplementsWe do love our dietary supplements. A venerable alphabet of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs, botanicals, enzymes, and energy drinks can be had on line and in local stores that make all sorts of health claims. Apparently many of us believe them since the global market for dietary supplements is nearly $220 billion a year.1Regulations VaryWith so many supplements on the market, it raises an obvious question: who regulates them? The answer is not so simple. In the European Union there are strict regulations as to the labelling, contents, claims, and dosage recommendations of dietary supplements.2 While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also requires supplements to be labeled, those labels lack the detail mandated by the EU.3 In addition, the FDA does not require proof of either the safety or effectiveness of supplements before they go to market. Instead, the supplement industry is expected to police itself. If any serious safety or contamination issues occur, its manufacturer is then required to notify the FDA.4That does not mean that some supplement companies are allowed to make unsubstantiated claims about their products. The Federal Trade Commission recently fought product claims to treat or prevent serious diseases, including heart disease and prostate cancer. The FTC also won a case where a company claimed that its product was a “clinically proven natural solution to diabetes.”5Then there are state regulations, with California leading the way. The California Safe Drinking Water & Toxic Enforcement Act of 1985 (known as Prop 65) prohibits exposure to chemicals that might cause cancer or reproductive problems. Since lead and many other heavy metals are both cancer-causing agents and reproductive toxins, human consumption of these must be kept below 0.5 µg/day.6 That poses a challenge for supplement manufacturers. A single antacid tab or supplement, for instance, may contain 100% of the required daily amount of calcium, which also contains trace amounts of lead. Since antacids and supplements, including fish oil, are commonly ingested in larger amounts on a daily basis, reputable manufacturers are now regularly testing their products for lead and other heavy metals on a regular basis to ensure their products are below the legal allowable limits.7The Importance Of ICP-MSWhether you are a regulator, supplier, or manufacturer, analytical testing of supplements using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) is an essential tool in maintaining Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). GMP is a universally recognized system of processes, procedures, and documentation to help assure that a product being produced by a supplement manufacturer has the identity, strength, composition, quality, and purity that it is represented to possess, says Ed Wyszumiala, General Manager of Dietary Supplements at NSF International, the leading global provider of public health and safety-based risk management solutions.8 Such concerns take on an even larger significance as the global economy continues to expand and raw materials and ingredients, including nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticles, that are now found in supplements may originate from virtually anywhere on the globe.9According to Lee Davidowski, PhD, Senior Product Specialist at PerkinElmer, ICP-MS is the most suitable technique available for determining the presence of heavy metals in supplements at very low levels. Using the PerkinElmer® NexION® ICP-MS, scientists have been able to detect lead in calcium-containing supplements at levels 50 – 100x lower than other detection techniques, such as Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. That is particularly important when considering the cumulative effect of consuming multiple supplements per day.10“The NexION® family of ICP-MS instruments not only meet the Good Manufacturing Practice needs of the supplements industry,” Stephan says, “ they extend the metal analysis capabilities of the modern laboratory to meet even more challenging analyses in the future.”

BackgroundTo celebrate the opening of the Buffalo Medical Innovation and Commercialization Hub (BMIC) in Buffalo, NY, in 2015, PerkinElmer and Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (AMRI) pledged to work together to provide a range of comprehensive services to the regional medical and scientific community, including expertise with diverse chemistry, library design and synthesis, in vitro biology and pharmacology, drug metabolism, and pharmacokinetics.Leveraging PerkinElmerTwo years into that collaboration, AMRI is making great strides forward by leveraging PerkinElmer’s cloud-based data management Signals™ Translational platform to aggregate research from a variety of sources and relate that data to meaningful scientific concepts, GEN Magazine reports.1AMRI is creating data using a PerkinElmer cell::explorer® workstation. This robotic automation platform for cellular applications can analyze large, complex datasets from various translational platforms. The results are allowing AMRI to live up to its promise of sharing advanced translational data research with its BMIC partners and others as a means to accelerate the understanding of, and, in many cases, advance the drug discovery process.2According to Jens Hoefkens, Director of Research, Strategic Marketing, Informatics for PerkinElmer, the PerkinElmer Signals™ Translational platform helps researchers integrate data from existing proprietary databases, and private and public databases such as GEO and tranSMART, and link with other enterprise systems. “It is a Software as a Service (SaaS) model that provides organizations with the flexibility and scalability they need to store structured and unstructured data, easily query, extract, identify and store information, and normalize the representation of stored data,” Hoefkens says.Equally important is the Signals™ Translational platform emphasis on collaboration that is helping to break down traditional research and clinical data silos. As demonstrated by AMRI’s success in integrating big data tools to improve and share its research and development processes, it also marks an important step forward in advancing precision medicine by ensuring the best pairing between patients and drugs.We are PerkinElmer … innovating and collaborating for a healthier world.

Background On Ovarian CancerFor the more than 22,000 American women diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year, a new treatment could soon increase their chances of survival beyond the current estimate of 50% after five years.1The current high mortality rate is the result of several factors. Foremost among them is that the most lethal form of the disease—epithelial ovarian cancer—happens to be its most common form, affecting up to 90% of women diagnosed with the disease. Then there is the insidious side of the deadly disease. In its early stages, ovarian cancer has few if any noticeable symptoms that escape even the most skilled diagnosticians. By the time the disease is finally discovered, the cancer is usually at an advanced stage.2Finally, there is the long-term efficacy of treatment options. Most ovarian cancer patients initially undergo major surgery for the removal of cancerous ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and nearby lymph nodes. Chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy treatments normally follow. Cisplatin, a platinum-based compound, is one of the most effective chemotherapy drugs used against ovarian cancer. A standard treatment since the 1970s, cisplatin and the related platinum derivatives, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, initially work well against cancer cells. Unfortunately, patients usually relapse and their cancer develops a strong resistance to cisplatin treatment.3Emerging New StrategiesResearchers at the National Institutes of Health and PerkinElmer are working to change that. “The problem with studying cisplatin uptake in cells is the methodology,” Lauren Amable, Ph.D., and Staff Scientist at the NIH’s National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities, says. “Traditionally, we treat cells with cisplatin, then measure the total amount of platinum in the cell population using atomic spectroscopy or inductively coupled mass spectrometry.” That, however, raises more questions than answers, since the traditional approach focuses on the total cell population and not the individual cells themselves. “In reality, cellular uptake of cisplatin most likely varies in response,” Amable says, “but until now, there have not been effective methods to evaluate its uptake.”Single Cell ICP-MSThe method Dr. Amable is referring to is a revolutionary new technology developed by PerkinElmer. It features the company’s new NexION® ICP-MS Single Cell Analyzer (SP-ICP-MS) that allows for the analysis and quantification of metal content per individual cells.“For the first time, the NexION SC-ICP-MS allows for the quantification of metal at the level of a single ovarian cancer cell,” Chady Stephan, Senior Leader of Applications at PerkinElmer and a co-researcher on the ovarian cancer cell study, says.“The technique is based on the ability to measure discrete signals generated from a cell when it enters the plasma, and allows for the quantification of cisplatin within individual cells,” Dr. Amable explains. “The new technology shows that cisplatin uptake more closely reflects what actually occurs within tumor cells,” she notes. “That, in turn will lead to the development of new strategies to increase cisplatin uptake in cancer cells, translating to better clinical responses.”“Future studies using Single Cell ICP-MS will allow researchers to better understand cisplatin uptake in cancer cells that will likely lead to new therapies not only for the treatment of ovarian cancer, but for a number of other cancers treated with cisplatin or other metal based drugs,” Stephan says. In the big picture, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach to cancer, this new technology will help advance research into personalized treatments tailored to the needs of each patient.

A Global Blood DisorderOver 400,000 babies are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) each year, making it the most common genetic disease in the world.1 In its most severe form, known as HbSS, SCD distorts hemoglobin S, or sickle hemoglobin, into a sickle shape from which the disease derives its name.2 These irregularly shaped red blood cells are sticky and tend to block the normal blood and oxygen flow to the body. Left untreated, SCD sufferers can experience a variety of acute conditions from chronic fatigue and infections to a high rate of severe strokes and premature death.3Testing for SCD is well established in the United States and Europe.4 In the U.S, for example, a simple heel-prick blood spot test of newborns is part of a comprehensive screening process for several genetic disorders. Among the most common and effective tests for SCD is hemoglobin isoelectric focusing (IEF) technology. PerkinElmer is a global provider of this technology that helps detect SCD. It is also a global leader in tests for more than 50 other inherited disorders in newborns used around the world. Since the U.S. adopted the SCD screen on a nationwide basis as of 2006, thousands of American children with SCD receive critical treatment to ease their symptoms and prolong their lives. As a testament to early screening and medical advances, there are now an estimated 100,000 Americans living with SCD.5 That is great news. More sobering is the fact that they incur medical costs of more than $1.1 billion a year.6That kind of money—let alone the ability to even detect the disease in its newborns—is unrealistic in countries where most SCD cases occur. While there are high SCD incidence rates in India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, sub-Saharan Africa is especially hard pressed. With over 75% of known SCD cases in the world, the true mortality rates for SCD in sub-Saharan Africa are unknown. Recent studies suggest that between 50% - 90% of children with SCD die before they turn five.7Following The DiseaseOver the past seven years, Dr. Russell Ware, a renowned SCD specialist and director of hematology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, has worked with PerkinElmer, medical teams, and government officials in Angola and Uganda to establish SCD pilot testing centers.In Angola, under Dr. Ware’s initiative, PerkinElmer’s Regional Sales Leader for Newborn Screening Petri Huhtinen joined an academic-industry-government partnership to establish screening laboratories and provide training to lab and medical professionals in the city of Luanda on effective screening procedures and simple, highly effective interventions that are saving countless lives.“We spent a lot of time building capacity,” Dr. Ware says. “We trained Angolan medical technicians in how to use IEF equipment from PerkinElmer, which was very reliable, robust, and easy to use.” That proved to be significant. “Maternity hospitals in Angola are very rapid turnaround, where women give birth and are released within six hours,” Dr. Ware says, so the durability and ease-of use of the equipment were essential to the pilot project’s success. Thanks to PerkinElmer’s continuing collaboration, the Angolan team processed over 500 samples a week using PerkinElmer screening reagents. In a matter of 18 months, the Angolans analyzed nearly 36,500 samples and found 21% of newborns carrying the SCD trait. That means 1 in 70 babies, or 1.5%, has the disease.8With Huhtinen’s help, Dr. Ware and PerkinElmer set up a second testing laboratory in Uganda, one of the world’s poorest nations.  Uganda also has one of the highest rates of HIV-infected births in the world. No one is certain how many of Uganda’s more than 1.6 million babies born annually are born with SCD, but researchers say the total could be as high as 15%.9Working with the Uganda Ministry of Health, Makerere University, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, and the Central Public Health Laboratory in Kampala, Dr. Ware and PerkinElmer were able to repurpose early infant HIV blood test cards for SCD testing as well. So far, the sickle cell lab has conducted over 100,000 screens. “Because of this remarkable partnership, we got the staff trained and the lab up and running very quickly,” Dr. Ware says, adding that he eventually hopes to have portable capabilities to test children in their villages.“Our goal is capacity building, because we cannot do everything by ourselves,” Dr. Ware says. “We found that all of these countries want to develop the capacity themselves, and they are very proud of the fact that they are doing the work. So, they want laboratory education training, sustainable programs, the equipment, and a research platform to record the results.”“Sickle cell disease is not even on the list of childhood deaths in Africa, because there is simply no data collected for SCD,” Dr. Ware says. He notes, however, that three areas—pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea—which account for up to 44% of childhood deaths in Africa are closely associated with SCD.10That is where PerkinElmer’s nearly 8,000 professionals have repeatedly stepped up to the challenge. No fanfare, no pats on the back. We are just a company turning our knowledge and innovation into action for a healthier world.

A Global Blood DisorderOver 400,000 babies are born with sickle cell disease (SCD) each year, making it the most common genetic disease in the world.1 In its most severe form, known as HbSS, SCD distorts hemoglobin S, or sickle hemoglobin, into a sickle shape from which the disease derives its name.2 These irregularly shaped red blood cells are sticky and tend to block the normal blood and oxygen flow to the body. Left untreated, SCD sufferers can experience a variety of acute conditions from chronic fatigue and infections to a high rate of severe strokes and premature death.3Testing for SCD is well established in the United States and Europe.4 In the U.S, for example, a simple heel-prick blood spot test of newborns is part of a comprehensive screening process for several genetic disorders. Among the most common and effective tests for SCD is hemoglobin isoelectric focusing (IEF) technology. PerkinElmer is a global provider of this technology that helps detect SCD. It is also a global leader in tests for more than 50 other inherited disorders in newborns used around the world. Since the U.S. adopted the SCD screen on a nationwide basis as of 2006, thousands of American children with SCD receive critical treatment to ease their symptoms and prolong their lives. As a testament to early screening and medical advances, there are now an estimated 100,000 Americans living with SCD.5 That is great news. More sobering is the fact that they incur medical costs of more than $1.1 billion a year.6That kind of money—let alone the ability to even detect the disease in its newborns—is unrealistic in countries where most SCD cases occur. While there are high SCD incidence rates in India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, sub-Saharan Africa is especially hard pressed. With over 75% of known SCD cases in the world, the true mortality rates for SCD in sub-Saharan Africa are unknown. Recent studies suggest that between 50% - 90% of children with SCD die before they turn five.7Following The DiseaseOver the past seven years, Dr. Russell Ware, a renowned SCD specialist and director of hematology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, has worked with PerkinElmer, medical teams, and government officials in Angola and Uganda to establish SCD pilot testing centers.In Angola, under Dr. Ware’s initiative, PerkinElmer’s Regional Sales Leader for Newborn Screening Petri Huhtinen joined an academic-industry-government partnership to establish screening laboratories and provide training to lab and medical professionals in the city of Luanda on effective screening procedures and simple, highly effective interventions that are saving countless lives.“We spent a lot of time building capacity,” Dr. Ware says. “We trained Angolan medical technicians in how to use IEF equipment from PerkinElmer, which was very reliable, robust, and easy to use.” That proved to be significant. “Maternity hospitals in Angola are very rapid turnaround, where women give birth and are released within six hours,” Dr. Ware says, so the durability and ease-of use of the equipment were essential to the pilot project’s success. Thanks to PerkinElmer’s continuing collaboration, the Angolan team processed over 500 samples a week using PerkinElmer screening reagents. In a matter of 18 months, the Angolans analyzed nearly 36,500 samples and found 21% of newborns carrying the SCD trait. That means 1 in 70 babies, or 1.5%, has the disease.8With Huhtinen’s help, Dr. Ware and PerkinElmer set up a second testing laboratory in Uganda, one of the world’s poorest nations.  Uganda also has one of the highest rates of HIV-infected births in the world. No one is certain how many of Uganda’s more than 1.6 million babies born annually are born with SCD, but researchers say the total could be as high as 15%.9Working with the Uganda Ministry of Health, Makerere University, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, and the Central Public Health Laboratory in Kampala, Dr. Ware and PerkinElmer were able to repurpose early infant HIV blood test cards for SCD testing as well. So far, the sickle cell lab has conducted over 100,000 screens. “Because of this remarkable partnership, we got the staff trained and the lab up and running very quickly,” Dr. Ware says, adding that he eventually hopes to have portable capabilities to test children in their villages.“Our goal is capacity building, because we cannot do everything by ourselves,” Dr. Ware says. “We found that all of these countries want to develop the capacity themselves, and they are very proud of the fact that they are doing the work. So, they want laboratory education training, sustainable programs, the equipment, and a research platform to record the results.”“Sickle cell disease is not even on the list of childhood deaths in Africa, because there is simply no data collected for SCD,” Dr. Ware says. He notes, however, that three areas—pneumonia, malaria, and diarrhea—which account for up to 44% of childhood deaths in Africa are closely associated with SCD.10That is where PerkinElmer’s nearly 8,000 professionals have repeatedly stepped up to the challenge. No fanfare, no pats on the back. We are just a company turning our knowledge and innovation into action for a healthier world.

Berries And PesticidesJust about everyone loves berries. From fresh-picked to frozen, preserves to juices, the global berry industry is literally bursting at the seams. Analysts estimate the global berry business is worth more than $78 billion (USD) a year and—no pun intended—it is growing fast.To meet the global demand for berries, growers rely on dozens of pesticides to protect their crops and increase their production. A recent consumer survey, meanwhile, shows that 85% of us berry eaters are worried about pesticides on and possible in our fruit.Pesticides And People“Fetuses, babies, and kids are more vulnerable to the effects of pesticides because their organs and nervous systems are still developing,” Philip Landrigan, M.D., director of the Children’s Environmental Health Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, told Consumer Reports recently. Kids with high levels of a particularly toxic class of pesticides called organophosphates (OPs) have a 50% higher rate of attention deficient disorder and lower IQ scores than kids who tested negative for the toxin.2

But it is not only children who need to worry. Average adults have 29 different pesticide residues in their bodies, and some of them are known carcinogens. As for the majority of the hundreds of other pesticides on the market? We just do not know enough about them to determine their long-term impact on human health.3Regulating The Berry BusinessFor those pesticides that we do classify as potentially dangerous, most nations set strict regulations on their use and maximum allowable amounts in foods, usually measured in the parts per million (ppm) and parts per billion (ppb). Diazinon, for example, is one of the aforementioned organophosphates that is used globally to control pests. In the U.S., the FDA allowable limit for diazinon residue on blueberries is .5 ppm. In the EU, that same pesticide is limited to .01 ppm.4In order to measure such small amounts of these compounds in berries, producers, as well as federal and state regulators, rely on Liquid Chromatography coupled with tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as their method of choice because it is both sensitive and accurate.5Improving On A StandardScientists at PerkinElmer recently employed a new and unique laminar flow UPLC-ESI-MS/MS triple-quad mass spectrometer to detect and quantify 40 different pesticides in four brands of off-the-shelf nonorganic berries.6In order to do so, PerkinElmer researchers first employed the “QuEChERS” (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) system to extract the pesticide residues in the heavily pigmented berry samples. They then used the PerkinElmer Altus A-30 UPLC System for chromatographic separation as well as the PerkinElmer QSight 220 MS/MS detector with dual ionization source for detection of the various compounds.“All of the tested pesticides were detected with good signal to noise even at concentrations well below the regulatory limits,” Josh Ye, Senior Application Scientist at PerkinElmer, says. The only pesticide detected at a level close to the EU limit in berries was hexyythiazox, but it was still below the .5 ppm.7According to PerkinElmer scientists, their UPLC-ESI-MS/MS triple-quad mass spectrometer technique not only detected all of the tested pesticides at levels well below regulatory limits, it also demonstrated some distinct advantages over previous methods.“First, the dilution of the QuEChERS extract with water makes the sample extract more compatible with typical reversed phase separation, leading to reduced solvent effects,” the team concludes. Equally important, “the dilution also helps to reduce any potential matrix effects, leading to more accurate and reproducible results.” Finally, Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) significantly decreases the amount of time and solvent used for the analysis.8So what does all that mean for us? How about peace of mind, thanks to the professionals at PerkinElmer, a company dedicated to innovation for a healthier world – one berry at a time.PerkinElmer’s unique laminar flow UPLC-ESI-MS/MS triple-quad mass spectrometer is capable of detecting all pesticide residues in fruit at levels well below the established limits for both the U.S. and EU.

History[edit]
Founding companies[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was founded in 1937 by Richard Perkin and Charles Elmer as an optical design and consulting company. In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with Cetus Corporation (and later Hoffmann-La Roche) to pioneer the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH located in Überlingen at Lake Constance, and England (Perkin Elmer Ltd) at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.
EG&G began in 1931; It was started by two MIT professors, Harold Edgerton and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as EG&G.
Computer Systems Division[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was involved in computer manufacture for a time. The Perkin-Elmer Computer Systems Division was formed through the purchase of Interdata, Inc., an independent computer manufacturer, in 1973–74 for some $63 million.[1][2] This merger made Perkin-Elmer's annual sales rise to over $200 million.[2] This was also known as Perkin-Elmer's Data Systems Group.[3]
The 32-bit computers were very similar to an IBM System/370, but ran the OS/32MT operating system.
The Wollongong Group provided the commercial version of the Unix port to the Interdata 7/32 hardware, known as Edition 7 Unix. The port was originally done by the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia, and was the first UNIX port to hardware other than the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP family. By 1982 the Wollongong Group Edition 7 Unix and Programmer's Workbench (PWB) were available on models such as the Perkin-Elmer 3210 and 3240 minicomputers.
In 1985, the computing division of Perkin-Elmer was spun off as Concurrent Computer Corporation.[4]
1999[edit]
Modern PerkinElmer traces its history back to a merger between divisions of what had been two S&P 500 companies, EG&G Inc. (formerly NYSE: EGG) of Wellesley, Massachusetts and Perkin-Elmer (formerly NYSE: PKN) of Norwalk, Connecticut. On May 28, 1999, the non-government side of EG&G Inc. purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of Perkin-Elmer, its traditional business segment, for US$425 million, also assuming the Perkin-Elmer name and forming the new PerkinElmer company, with new officers and a new Board of Directors.[5][6] At the time, EG&G made products for diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and photography.[6]
The old Perkin-Elmer Board of Directors and Officers remained at that reorganized company under its new name, PE Corporation. It had been the Life Sciences division of Perkin-Elmer, and its two component tracking stock business groups, Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and PE Biosystems (formerly NYSE: PEB), were centrally involved in the highest profile biotechnology events of the decade, the intense race against the Human Genome Project consortium, which then resulted in the genomics segment of the technology bubble. It should also be noted that Perkin-Elmer purchased the Boston operations of NEN Life Sciences in 2001.

Recently[edit]
In 1992, the company merged with Applied Biosystems. In 1997 they merged with PerSeptive Biosystems. On July 14, 1999, the new analytical instruments maker PerkinElmer cut 350 jobs, or 12%, in its cost reduction reorganization.[6] In 2006, PerkinElmer sold off the Fluid Sciences division for approximately $400M; the aim of the selloff was to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth health sciences and photonic markets. Following on from the selloff, a number of small businesses were acquired, including Spectral Genomics, Improvision, Evotec-Technologies, Euroscreen, ViaCell, and Avalon Instruments. The brand "Evotec-Technologies" remains the property of Evotec, the former owner company. PerkinElmer had a license to use the brand till the end of year 2007.
PerkinElmer has continued to expand its interest in medicine with the acquisitions of clinical laboratories, In July 2006, it acquired NTD Labs located on Long Island, New York. The laboratory specializes in prenatal screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. In 2007, it purchased ViaCell, Inc. for $300 million,[7] which included its offices in Boston and cord blood storage facility in Kentucky near Cincinnati. The company was renamed ViaCord.
In March 2008, PerkinElmer purchased Pediatrix Screening (formerly Neo Gen Screening), a laboratory located in Bridgeville, PA specializing in screening newborns for various inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, and sickle-cell disease. It renamed the laboratory PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc.
In May 2011, PerkinElmer announced the signature of an agreement to acquire CambridgeSoft, and the successful acquisition of ArtusLabs.[8]
In September 2011, PerkinElmer bought Caliper Life Sciences for $600 million.[9]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire the Indian in vitro diagnostic company, Tulip Diagnostics.[10] In May of the same year the company acquired Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics for approximately $1.3 billion.[11]
Programs[edit]
Hubble optics project[edit]




Polishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, May 1979. The engineer pictured is Dr. Martin Yellin, an optical engineer working for Perkin-Elmer on the project.


Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit[12] was commissioned to build the optical components of the Hubble Space Telescope. The construction of the main mirror began in 1979 and completed in 1981. The polishing process ran over budget and behind schedule, producing significant friction with NASA. Due to a miscalibrated null corrector, the primary mirror was also found to have a significant spherical aberration after reaching orbit on STS-31. Perkin-Elmer's own calculations and measurements revealed the primary mirror's surface discrepancies, but the company chose to withhold that data from NASA. A NASA investigation heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for management failings, disregarding written quality guidelines, and ignoring test data that revealed the miscalibration.[13] Corrective optics were installed on the telescope during the first Hubble service and repair mission STS-61. The correction, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, was applied entirely to the secondary mirror and replaced existing instrumentation; the aberration of the primary mirror remained uncorrected.
The company agreed to pay US $15 million, essentially forgoing its fees in polishing the mirror, to avoid a threatened liability lawsuit under the False Claims Act by the Federal government. Hughes Aircraft which acquired the Danbury Optical System unit one month after the launch of the telescope, paid $10 million. The Justice Department asserted that the companies should have known about the flawed testing. Trade group Aerospace Industries Association protested when concerns were raised in the aerospace industry that aerospace companies might be held liable for failed equipment.[12]
KH-9 Hexagon[edit]
Perkin-Elmer built the optical systems for the KH-9 Hexagon series of spy satellites at a facility in Danbury, Connecticut.[14]
In the 1950s, an aerial panoramic camera lens was capable of recording the entire state of Pennsylvania in two flyovers, with resolution that enabled one to count the autos on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.[15]

History[edit]
Founding companies[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was founded in 1937 by Richard Perkin and Charles Elmer as an optical design and consulting company. In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with Cetus Corporation (and later Hoffmann-La Roche) to pioneer the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH located in Überlingen at Lake Constance, and England (Perkin Elmer Ltd) at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.
EG&G began in 1931; It was started by two MIT professors, Harold Edgerton and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as EG&G.

Polishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, May 1979. The engineer pictured is Dr. Martin Yellin, an optical engineer working for Perkin-Elmer on the project.


Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit[12] was commissioned to build the optical components of the Hubble Space Telescope. The construction of the main mirror began in 1979 and completed in 1981. The polishing process ran over budget and behind schedule, producing significant friction with NASA. Due to a miscalibrated null corrector, the primary mirror was also found to have a significant spherical aberration after reaching orbit on STS-31. Perkin-Elmer's own calculations and measurements revealed the primary mirror's surface discrepancies, but the company chose to withhold that data from NASA. A NASA investigation heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for management failings, disregarding written quality guidelines, and ignoring test data that revealed the miscalibration.[13] Corrective optics were installed on the telescope during the first Hubble service and repair mission STS-61. The correction, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, was applied entirely to the secondary mirror and replaced existing instrumentation; the aberration of the primary mirror remained uncorrected.
The company agreed to pay US $15 million, essentially forgoing its fees in polishing the mirror, to avoid a threatened liability lawsuit under the False Claims Act by the Federal government. Hughes Aircraft which acquired the Danbury Optical System unit one month after the launch of the telescope, paid $10 million. The Justice Department asserted that the companies should have known about the flawed testing. Trade group Aerospace Industries Association protested when concerns were raised in the aerospace industry that aerospace companies might be held liable for failed equipment.[12]
KH-9 Hexagon[edit]
Perkin-Elmer built the optical systems for the KH-9 Hexagon series of spy satellites at a facility in Danbury, Connecticut.[14]
In the 1950s, an aerial panoramic camera lens was capable of recording the entire state of Pennsylvania in two flyovers, with resolution that enabled one to count the autos on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.[15]

History[edit]
Founding companies[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was founded in 1937 by Richard Perkin and Charles Elmer as an optical design and consulting company. In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with Cetus Corporation (and later Hoffmann-La Roche) to pioneer the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH located in Überlingen at Lake Constance, and England (Perkin Elmer Ltd) at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.
EG&G began in 1931; It was started by two MIT professors, Harold Edgerton and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as EG&G.
Computer Systems Division[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was involved in computer manufacture for a time. The Perkin-Elmer Computer Systems Division was formed through the purchase of Interdata, Inc., an independent computer manufacturer, in 1973–74 for some $63 million.[1][2] This merger made Perkin-Elmer's annual sales rise to over $200 million.[2] This was also known as Perkin-Elmer's Data Systems Group.[3]
The 32-bit computers were very similar to an IBM System/370, but ran the OS/32MT operating system.
The Wollongong Group provided the commercial version of the Unix port to the Interdata 7/32 hardware, known as Edition 7 Unix. The port was originally done by the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia, and was the first UNIX port to hardware other than the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP family. By 1982 the Wollongong Group Edition 7 Unix and Programmer's Workbench (PWB) were available on models such as the Perkin-Elmer 3210 and 3240 minicomputers.
In 1985, the computing division of Perkin-Elmer was spun off as Concurrent Computer Corporation.[4]
1999[edit]
Modern PerkinElmer traces its history back to a merger between divisions of what had been two S&P 500 companies, EG&G Inc. (formerly NYSE: EGG) of Wellesley, Massachusetts and Perkin-Elmer (formerly NYSE: PKN) of Norwalk, Connecticut. On May 28, 1999, the non-government side of EG&G Inc. purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of Perkin-Elmer, its traditional business segment, for US$425 million, also assuming the Perkin-Elmer name and forming the new PerkinElmer company, with new officers and a new Board of Directors.[5][6] At the time, EG&G made products for diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and photography.[6]
The old Perkin-Elmer Board of Directors and Officers remained at that reorganized company under its new name, PE Corporation. It had been the Life Sciences division of Perkin-Elmer, and its two component tracking stock business groups, Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and PE Biosystems (formerly NYSE: PEB), were centrally involved in the highest profile biotechnology events of the decade, the intense race against the Human Genome Project consortium, which then resulted in the genomics segment of the technology bubble. It should also be noted that Perkin-Elmer purchased the Boston operations of NEN Life Sciences in 2001.




PerkinElmer headquarters in Waltham


Recently[edit]
In 1992, the company merged with Applied Biosystems. In 1997 they merged with PerSeptive Biosystems. On July 14, 1999, the new analytical instruments maker PerkinElmer cut 350 jobs, or 12%, in its cost reduction reorganization.[6] In 2006, PerkinElmer sold off the Fluid Sciences division for approximately $400M; the aim of the selloff was to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth health sciences and photonic markets. Following on from the selloff, a number of small businesses were acquired, including Spectral Genomics, Improvision, Evotec-Technologies, Euroscreen, ViaCell, and Avalon Instruments. The brand "Evotec-Technologies" remains the property of Evotec, the former owner company. PerkinElmer had a license to use the brand till the end of year 2007.
PerkinElmer has continued to expand its interest in medicine with the acquisitions of clinical laboratories, In July 2006, it acquired NTD Labs located on Long Island, New York. The laboratory specializes in prenatal screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. In 2007, it purchased ViaCell, Inc. for $300 million,[7] which included its offices in Boston and cord blood storage facility in Kentucky near Cincinnati. The company was renamed ViaCord.
In March 2008, PerkinElmer purchased Pediatrix Screening (formerly Neo Gen Screening), a laboratory located in Bridgeville, PA specializing in screening newborns for various inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, and sickle-cell disease. It renamed the laboratory PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc.
In May 2011, PerkinElmer announced the signature of an agreement to acquire CambridgeSoft, and the successful acquisition of ArtusLabs.[8]
In September 2011, PerkinElmer bought Caliper Life Sciences for $600 million.[9]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire the Indian in vitro diagnostic company, Tulip Diagnostics.[10] In May of the same year the company acquired Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics for approximately $1.3 billion.[11]

                                                                    - A307                                                            








        Description    


The Model 307 oxidizer makes use of a patented flame oxidation technology, of type "open/close". The result of this is an oxidizer that can expand experimental designs in applications such as liquid scintillation counting. The combustion of sample material increases the accuracy of the LS counting process, because of the lack of color quench, self-absorption, spectral overlap and chemiluminescence. 

This is also a solution for overcoming costly chemical sample preparation, which contributes towards the elimination of the problems associated with non-soluble samples. The item substantially improves precise and effective sample combustion, yielding 100% isotope separation in the case of dual label experiments.

PerkinElmer To Acquire EUROIMMUN For Complementary Products And Distribution - PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PerkinElmer To Acquire EUROIMMUN For Complementary Products And DistributionJun.19.17 | About: PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryMedical diagnostics company PerkinElmer has agreed to acquire EUROIMMUN for $1.3 billion in an all-cash deal.EUROIMMUN is a major autoimmune testing firm with significant operations in emerging markets, including China.The deal provides a complementary set of capabilities and geographical distribution for promising cross-selling opportunities.Initial market reaction is highly positive on the deal and I agree with the sentiment.



 Quick Take Medical diagnostics and discovery company PerkinElmer (PKI) has announced an agreement to acquire EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG for $1.3 billion in cash. EUROIMMUN is a leading autoimmune testing company with a growing business in infectious disease and allergy testing. The deal appears to be complementary in terms of providing both firms with respective geographic and product strengths, so should be a win for PKI shareholders. Target Company Lubeck, Germany-based EUROIMMUN was founded in 1987 to provide a range of medical laboratory reagents to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune and infectious diseases and allergies. Management is headed by founder and CEO Winfried Stocker. Below is a brief demo video about EUROIMMUN:  (Source: EUROIMMUN US) EUROIMMUN has 2,400 employees, 14 international subsidiaries between 35 countries and has more than 60 distributors generating sales in more than 130 countries, ‘with approximately 45% of revenues in China, 39% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 5% in the Americas and 20% in Rest of World.'
 Acquisition Terms and Rationale PerkinElmer is paying $1.3 billion in cash for $310 million in 2017 revenues, a multiple of 4.2x. This is higher than a public company basket of firms in the NYU Stern Revenue Multiples dataset, which as of January 2017 showed an aggregate Price/Sales multiple of 3.34x for Healthcare Products companies. As of PKI’s April 2, 2017, 10-Q filing, the company had $288.3 million in cash and total liabilities of $2.1 billion. So, in light of PerkinElmer’s $7.3 billion market cap, this $1.3 billion deal represents a major transaction for the firm and will require it to add significant debt to its balance sheet to close the deal. PKI says the deal ‘is expected to be accretive to PerkinElmer’s 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share result by approximately $0.28 to $0.30. Additionally, PerkinElmer is reaffirming its 2017 revenue and earnings per share guidance.’ One major strategic rationale for the combination is the relatively small penetration by EUROIMMUN in the Americas, at currently only 5%, which PKI intends to grow through offering EUROIMMUN’s industry-leading autoimmune testing services. Another important driver is EUROIMMUN’s 45% revenue base from sales in China, which PKI will want to tap to cross-sell its capabilities. As PKI stated in the deal announcement,    The acquisition combines two innovative, results-driven cultures with a shared mission of improving global health. The combination expands PerkinElmer’s reach into autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets, while offering new infectious disease capabilities to customers in China. In addition, as a market leader in the U.S. for reproductive health, PerkinElmer will have the opportunity to drive EUROIMMUN’s solutions into this well established channel.  With the new company under its wing, PKI will also round out a diagnostics portfolio for a variety of conditions including, autoimmune, infectious disease, gene analyses, reproductive health, allergy and genomics for oncology and other molecular tests.
 The overall market seems to like the deal announcement, with PKI trading up approximately 5% in early trading. At first blush, it appears the combination is a win-win, due to its complementarity, both geographically and product lines. I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

History[edit]
Founding companies[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was founded in 1937 by Richard Perkin and Charles Elmer as an optical design and consulting company. In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with Cetus Corporation (and later Hoffmann-La Roche) to pioneer the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH located in Überlingen at Lake Constance, and England (Perkin Elmer Ltd) at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.
EG&G began in 1931; It was started by two MIT professors, Harold Edgerton and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as EG&G.
Computer Systems Division[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was involved in computer manufacture for a time. The Perkin-Elmer Computer Systems Division was formed through the purchase of Interdata, Inc., an independent computer manufacturer, in 1973–74 for some $63 million.[1][2] This merger made Perkin-Elmer's annual sales rise to over $200 million.[2] This was also known as Perkin-Elmer's Data Systems Group.[3]
The 32-bit computers were very similar to an IBM System/370, but ran the OS/32MT operating system.
The Wollongong Group provided the commercial version of the Unix port to the Interdata 7/32 hardware, known as Edition 7 Unix. The port was originally done by the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia, and was the first UNIX port to hardware other than the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP family. By 1982 the Wollongong Group Edition 7 Unix and Programmer's Workbench (PWB) were available on models such as the Perkin-Elmer 3210 and 3240 minicomputers.
In 1985, the computing division of Perkin-Elmer was spun off as Concurrent Computer Corporation.[4]
1999[edit]
Modern PerkinElmer traces its history back to a merger between divisions of what had been two S&P 500 companies, EG&G Inc. (formerly NYSE: EGG) of Wellesley, Massachusetts and Perkin-Elmer (formerly NYSE: PKN) of Norwalk, Connecticut. On May 28, 1999, the non-government side of EG&G Inc. purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of Perkin-Elmer, its traditional business segment, for US$425 million, also assuming the Perkin-Elmer name and forming the new PerkinElmer company, with new officers and a new Board of Directors.[5][6] At the time, EG&G made products for diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and photography.[6]
The old Perkin-Elmer Board of Directors and Officers remained at that reorganized company under its new name, PE Corporation. It had been the Life Sciences division of Perkin-Elmer, and its two component tracking stock business groups, Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and PE Biosystems (formerly NYSE: PEB), were centrally involved in the highest profile biotechnology events of the decade, the intense race against the Human Genome Project consortium, which then resulted in the genomics segment of the technology bubble. It should also be noted that Perkin-Elmer purchased the Boston operations of NEN Life Sciences in 2001.




PerkinElmer headquarters in Waltham


Recently[edit]
In 1992, the company merged with Applied Biosystems. In 1997 they merged with PerSeptive Biosystems. On July 14, 1999, the new analytical instruments maker PerkinElmer cut 350 jobs, or 12%, in its cost reduction reorganization.[6] In 2006, PerkinElmer sold off the Fluid Sciences division for approximately $400M; the aim of the selloff was to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth health sciences and photonic markets. Following on from the selloff, a number of small businesses were acquired, including Spectral Genomics, Improvision, Evotec-Technologies, Euroscreen, ViaCell, and Avalon Instruments. The brand "Evotec-Technologies" remains the property of Evotec, the former owner company. PerkinElmer had a license to use the brand till the end of year 2007.
PerkinElmer has continued to expand its interest in medicine with the acquisitions of clinical laboratories, In July 2006, it acquired NTD Labs located on Long Island, New York. The laboratory specializes in prenatal screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. In 2007, it purchased ViaCell, Inc. for $300 million,[7] which included its offices in Boston and cord blood storage facility in Kentucky near Cincinnati. The company was renamed ViaCord.
In March 2008, PerkinElmer purchased Pediatrix Screening (formerly Neo Gen Screening), a laboratory located in Bridgeville, PA specializing in screening newborns for various inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, and sickle-cell disease. It renamed the laboratory PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc.
In May 2011, PerkinElmer announced the signature of an agreement to acquire CambridgeSoft, and the successful acquisition of ArtusLabs.[8]
In September 2011, PerkinElmer bought Caliper Life Sciences for $600 million.[9]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire the Indian in vitro diagnostic company, Tulip Diagnostics.[10] In May of the same year the company acquired Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics for approximately $1.3 billion.[11]
Programs[edit]
Hubble optics project[edit]




Polishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, May 1979. The engineer pictured is Dr. Martin Yellin, an optical engineer working for Perkin-Elmer on the project.


Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit[12] was commissioned to build the optical components of the Hubble Space Telescope. The construction of the main mirror began in 1979 and completed in 1981. The polishing process ran over budget and behind schedule, producing significant friction with NASA. Due to a miscalibrated null corrector, the primary mirror was also found to have a significant spherical aberration after reaching orbit on STS-31. Perkin-Elmer's own calculations and measurements revealed the primary mirror's surface discrepancies, but the company chose to withhold that data from NASA. A NASA investigation heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for management failings, disregarding written quality guidelines, and ignoring test data that revealed the miscalibration.[13] Corrective optics were installed on the telescope during the first Hubble service and repair mission STS-61. The correction, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, was applied entirely to the secondary mirror and replaced existing instrumentation; the aberration of the primary mirror remained uncorrected.
The company agreed to pay US $15 million, essentially forgoing its fees in polishing the mirror, to avoid a threatened liability lawsuit under the False Claims Act by the Federal government. Hughes Aircraft which acquired the Danbury Optical System unit one month after the launch of the telescope, paid $10 million. The Justice Department asserted that the companies should have known about the flawed testing. Trade group Aerospace Industries Association protested when concerns were raised in the aerospace industry that aerospace companies might be held liable for failed equipment.[12]
KH-9 Hexagon[edit]
Perkin-Elmer built the optical systems for the KH-9 Hexagon series of spy satellites at a facility in Danbury, Connecticut.[14]
In the 1950s, an aerial panoramic camera lens was capable of recording the entire state of Pennsylvania in two flyovers, with resolution that enabled one to count the autos on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.[15]

The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.

History[edit]
Founding companies[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was founded in 1937 by Richard Perkin and Charles Elmer as an optical design and consulting company. In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with Cetus Corporation (and later Hoffmann-La Roche) to pioneer the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH located in Überlingen at Lake Constance, and England (Perkin Elmer Ltd) at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.
EG&G began in 1931; It was started by two MIT professors, Harold Edgerton and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as EG&G.
Computer Systems Division[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was involved in computer manufacture for a time. The Perkin-Elmer Computer Systems Division was formed through the purchase of Interdata, Inc., an independent computer manufacturer, in 1973–74 for some $63 million.[1][2] This merger made Perkin-Elmer's annual sales rise to over $200 million.[2] This was also known as Perkin-Elmer's Data Systems Group.[3]
The 32-bit computers were very similar to an IBM System/370, but ran the OS/32MT operating system.
The Wollongong Group provided the commercial version of the Unix port to the Interdata 7/32 hardware, known as Edition 7 Unix. The port was originally done by the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia, and was the first UNIX port to hardware other than the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP family. By 1982 the Wollongong Group Edition 7 Unix and Programmer's Workbench (PWB) were available on models such as the Perkin-Elmer 3210 and 3240 minicomputers.
In 1985, the computing division of Perkin-Elmer was spun off as Concurrent Computer Corporation.[4]
1999[edit]
Modern PerkinElmer traces its history back to a merger between divisions of what had been two S&P 500 companies, EG&G Inc. (formerly NYSE: EGG) of Wellesley, Massachusetts and Perkin-Elmer (formerly NYSE: PKN) of Norwalk, Connecticut. On May 28, 1999, the non-government side of EG&G Inc. purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of Perkin-Elmer, its traditional business segment, for US$425 million, also assuming the Perkin-Elmer name and forming the new PerkinElmer company, with new officers and a new Board of Directors.[5][6] At the time, EG&G made products for diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and photography.[6]
The old Perkin-Elmer Board of Directors and Officers remained at that reorganized company under its new name, PE Corporation. It had been the Life Sciences division of Perkin-Elmer, and its two component tracking stock business groups, Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and PE Biosystems (formerly NYSE: PEB), were centrally involved in the highest profile biotechnology events of the decade, the intense race against the Human Genome Project consortium, which then resulted in the genomics segment of the technology bubble. It should also be noted that Perkin-Elmer purchased the Boston operations of NEN Life Sciences in 2001.

Recently[edit]
In 1992, the company merged with Applied Biosystems. In 1997 they merged with PerSeptive Biosystems. On July 14, 1999, the new analytical instruments maker PerkinElmer cut 350 jobs, or 12%, in its cost reduction reorganization.[6] In 2006, PerkinElmer sold off the Fluid Sciences division for approximately $400M; the aim of the selloff was to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth health sciences and photonic markets. Following on from the selloff, a number of small businesses were acquired, including Spectral Genomics, Improvision, Evotec-Technologies, Euroscreen, ViaCell, and Avalon Instruments. The brand "Evotec-Technologies" remains the property of Evotec, the former owner company. PerkinElmer had a license to use the brand till the end of year 2007.
PerkinElmer has continued to expand its interest in medicine with the acquisitions of clinical laboratories, In July 2006, it acquired NTD Labs located on Long Island, New York. The laboratory specializes in prenatal screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. In 2007, it purchased ViaCell, Inc. for $300 million,[7] which included its offices in Boston and cord blood storage facility in Kentucky near Cincinnati. The company was renamed ViaCord.
In March 2008, PerkinElmer purchased Pediatrix Screening (formerly Neo Gen Screening), a laboratory located in Bridgeville, PA specializing in screening newborns for various inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, and sickle-cell disease. It renamed the laboratory PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc.
In May 2011, PerkinElmer announced the signature of an agreement to acquire CambridgeSoft, and the successful acquisition of ArtusLabs.[8]
In September 2011, PerkinElmer bought Caliper Life Sciences for $600 million.[9]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire the Indian in vitro diagnostic company, Tulip Diagnostics.[10] In May of the same year the company acquired Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics for approximately $1.3 billion.[11]
Programs[edit]
Hubble optics project[edit]




Polishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, May 1979. The engineer pictured is Dr. Martin Yellin, an optical engineer working for Perkin-Elmer on the project.


Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit[12] was commissioned to build the optical components of the Hubble Space Telescope. The construction of the main mirror began in 1979 and completed in 1981. The polishing process ran over budget and behind schedule, producing significant friction with NASA. Due to a miscalibrated null corrector, the primary mirror was also found to have a significant spherical aberration after reaching orbit on STS-31. Perkin-Elmer's own calculations and measurements revealed the primary mirror's surface discrepancies, but the company chose to withhold that data from NASA. A NASA investigation heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for management failings, disregarding written quality guidelines, and ignoring test data that revealed the miscalibration.[13] Corrective optics were installed on the telescope during the first Hubble service and repair mission STS-61. The correction, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, was applied entirely to the secondary mirror and replaced existing instrumentation; the aberration of the primary mirror remained uncorrected.
The company agreed to pay US $15 million, essentially forgoing its fees in polishing the mirror, to avoid a threatened liability lawsuit under the False Claims Act by the Federal government. Hughes Aircraft which acquired the Danbury Optical System unit one month after the launch of the telescope, paid $10 million. The Justice Department asserted that the companies should have known about the flawed testing. Trade group Aerospace Industries Association protested when concerns were raised in the aerospace industry that aerospace companies might be held liable for failed equipment.[12]
KH-9 Hexagon[edit]
Perkin-Elmer built the optical systems for the KH-9 Hexagon series of spy satellites at a facility in Danbury, Connecticut.[14]
In the 1950s, an aerial panoramic camera lens was capable of recording the entire state of Pennsylvania in two flyovers, with resolution that enabled one to count the autos on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.[15]

The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.

History[edit]
Founding companies[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was founded in 1937 by Richard Perkin and Charles Elmer as an optical design and consulting company. In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with Cetus Corporation (and later Hoffmann-La Roche) to pioneer the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH located in Überlingen at Lake Constance, and England (Perkin Elmer Ltd) at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire.
EG&G began in 1931; It was started by two MIT professors, Harold Edgerton and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as EG&G.
Computer Systems Division[edit]
Perkin-Elmer was involved in computer manufacture for a time. The Perkin-Elmer Computer Systems Division was formed through the purchase of Interdata, Inc., an independent computer manufacturer, in 1973–74 for some $63 million.[1][2] This merger made Perkin-Elmer's annual sales rise to over $200 million.[2] This was also known as Perkin-Elmer's Data Systems Group.[3]
The 32-bit computers were very similar to an IBM System/370, but ran the OS/32MT operating system.
The Wollongong Group provided the commercial version of the Unix port to the Interdata 7/32 hardware, known as Edition 7 Unix. The port was originally done by the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, Australia, and was the first UNIX port to hardware other than the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP family. By 1982 the Wollongong Group Edition 7 Unix and Programmer's Workbench (PWB) were available on models such as the Perkin-Elmer 3210 and 3240 minicomputers.
In 1985, the computing division of Perkin-Elmer was spun off as Concurrent Computer Corporation.[4]
1999[edit]
Modern PerkinElmer traces its history back to a merger between divisions of what had been two S&P 500 companies, EG&G Inc. (formerly NYSE: EGG) of Wellesley, Massachusetts and Perkin-Elmer (formerly NYSE: PKN) of Norwalk, Connecticut. On May 28, 1999, the non-government side of EG&G Inc. purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of Perkin-Elmer, its traditional business segment, for US$425 million, also assuming the Perkin-Elmer name and forming the new PerkinElmer company, with new officers and a new Board of Directors.[5][6] At the time, EG&G made products for diverse industries including automotive, medical, aerospace and photography.[6]
The old Perkin-Elmer Board of Directors and Officers remained at that reorganized company under its new name, PE Corporation. It had been the Life Sciences division of Perkin-Elmer, and its two component tracking stock business groups, Celera Genomics (NYSE: CRA) and PE Biosystems (formerly NYSE: PEB), were centrally involved in the highest profile biotechnology events of the decade, the intense race against the Human Genome Project consortium, which then resulted in the genomics segment of the technology bubble. It should also be noted that Perkin-Elmer purchased the Boston operations of NEN Life Sciences in 2001.




PerkinElmer headquarters in Waltham


Recently[edit]
In 1992, the company merged with Applied Biosystems. In 1997 they merged with PerSeptive Biosystems. On July 14, 1999, the new analytical instruments maker PerkinElmer cut 350 jobs, or 12%, in its cost reduction reorganization.[6] In 2006, PerkinElmer sold off the Fluid Sciences division for approximately $400M; the aim of the selloff was to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth health sciences and photonic markets. Following on from the selloff, a number of small businesses were acquired, including Spectral Genomics, Improvision, Evotec-Technologies, Euroscreen, ViaCell, and Avalon Instruments. The brand "Evotec-Technologies" remains the property of Evotec, the former owner company. PerkinElmer had a license to use the brand till the end of year 2007.
PerkinElmer has continued to expand its interest in medicine with the acquisitions of clinical laboratories, In July 2006, it acquired NTD Labs located on Long Island, New York. The laboratory specializes in prenatal screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. In 2007, it purchased ViaCell, Inc. for $300 million,[7] which included its offices in Boston and cord blood storage facility in Kentucky near Cincinnati. The company was renamed ViaCord.
In March 2008, PerkinElmer purchased Pediatrix Screening (formerly Neo Gen Screening), a laboratory located in Bridgeville, PA specializing in screening newborns for various inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, and sickle-cell disease. It renamed the laboratory PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc.
In May 2011, PerkinElmer announced the signature of an agreement to acquire CambridgeSoft, and the successful acquisition of ArtusLabs.[8]
In September 2011, PerkinElmer bought Caliper Life Sciences for $600 million.[9]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire the Indian in vitro diagnostic company, Tulip Diagnostics.[10] In May of the same year the company acquired Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics for approximately $1.3 billion.[11]
Programs[edit]
Hubble optics project[edit]




Polishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, May 1979. The engineer pictured is Dr. Martin Yellin, an optical engineer working for Perkin-Elmer on the project.


Perkin-Elmer's Danbury Optical System unit[12] was commissioned to build the optical components of the Hubble Space Telescope. The construction of the main mirror began in 1979 and completed in 1981. The polishing process ran over budget and behind schedule, producing significant friction with NASA. Due to a miscalibrated null corrector, the primary mirror was also found to have a significant spherical aberration after reaching orbit on STS-31. Perkin-Elmer's own calculations and measurements revealed the primary mirror's surface discrepancies, but the company chose to withhold that data from NASA. A NASA investigation heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for management failings, disregarding written quality guidelines, and ignoring test data that revealed the miscalibration.[13] Corrective optics were installed on the telescope during the first Hubble service and repair mission STS-61. The correction, Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement, was applied entirely to the secondary mirror and replaced existing instrumentation; the aberration of the primary mirror remained uncorrected.
The company agreed to pay US $15 million, essentially forgoing its fees in polishing the mirror, to avoid a threatened liability lawsuit under the False Claims Act by the Federal government. Hughes Aircraft which acquired the Danbury Optical System unit one month after the launch of the telescope, paid $10 million. The Justice Department asserted that the companies should have known about the flawed testing. Trade group Aerospace Industries Association protested when concerns were raised in the aerospace industry that aerospace companies might be held liable for failed equipment.[12]
KH-9 Hexagon[edit]
Perkin-Elmer built the optical systems for the KH-9 Hexagon series of spy satellites at a facility in Danbury, Connecticut.[14]
In the 1950s, an aerial panoramic camera lens was capable of recording the entire state of Pennsylvania in two flyovers, with resolution that enabled one to count the autos on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.[15]

The spacing of the field lens in the corrector was to have been done by laser measurements off the end of an invar bar. Instead of illuminating the end of the bar, however, the laser in fact was reflected from a worn spot on a black-anodized metal cap placed over the end of the bar to isolate its center (visible through a hole in the cap). The technician who performed the test noted an unexpected gap between the field lens and its supporting structure in the corrector and filled it in with an ordinary metal washer.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
