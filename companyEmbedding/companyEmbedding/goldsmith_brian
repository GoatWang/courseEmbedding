Claire Anne Pasternack, the daughter of Dr. Gale Spector Pasternack and Sam Pasternack of Brookline, Mass., was married in Boston Saturday evening to Brian Mack Goldsmith, the son of Karen Mack and Russell Goldsmith of Los Angeles. Rabbi Ronne Friedman officiated at the Boston Public Library, with Judge Joseph L. Tauro of the Federal District Court in Boston participating.The couple met at Harvard, from which they graduated, the bride magna cum laude.Until June, the bride, 27, taught English, French and debating at the Harvard-Westlake School, a private school in Los Angeles. Next month, she is to begin studying for a master’s in policy, organization and leadership studies at the Stanford University School of Education.Her father, who retired as a partner in the Boston law firm Choate, Hall & Stewart, is a patent lawyer in the technology licensing office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her mother is a psychiatrist in private practice in Brookline.In September, the bridegroom, 28, is to begin his second year of law school at Stanford. From 2006 to 2009, he was an aide to Katie Couric and a producer on the staff of “The CBS Evening News” in New York.

The couple met in spring 2003 at a dinner among college friends, after Ms. Pasternack had been a last-minute addition to the entourage.“I plunked right down and ordered after everyone else,” she recalled.She placed a round-about order — pad Thai, extra broccoli, light on the oil, scallion on the side and Thai iced tea with no milk — that mirrored what Mr. Goldsmith had ordered ahead of her arrival.

“We ordered exactly the same thing in exactly the same way,” he said. “We couldn’t imagine someone else on earth as neurotic as either of us.”The conversation flowed, so Mr. Goldsmith decided to ask her out a couple of days later.As the frequency of their dates picked up, Ms. Pasternack, who was partial to French literature but not politics, made it clear that she wanted a platonic relationship. Mr. Goldsmith was disappointed, but undeterred.

“I saw someone equally persnickety about food, and I loved her sense of humor,” he said.A few weeks later their group of friends attended a lighthearted gathering, known as John Harvard’s Bar Mitzvah, which was sponsored by a Jewish campus organization.“We got very dressed up,” Ms. Pasternack said. “There was the Macarena and cheesy songs from the ’90s. We danced and held hands.”But still she told herself: “ ‘Oh, we’re friends.’ Things were ambiguous.”When he invited her to a formal dance, she readily accepted — as a friend.“I think he knew he could win me over,” she said.Indeed, before the dance he took her to a French restaurant, where they bonded over Époisses, a goopy French cheese, which thrilled them so much that the waiter let them take the remaining cheese with them in its wooden box. At the dance, they checked the smelly cheese box with their coats, and periodically looked in on it.

“That evening, I began to realize how much we had in common — not just food, but that we’re each passionate people, just about different things,” Ms. Pasternack said.“Brian has picked up a little French, and he knows his cheeses. I have tried to keep track of every member of the Senate, where they’re from, and what campaigns are hot.”ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY
