NOTES TO PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS                                               
Capstone Series Fund, Inc.                                                      
July 31, 2008

1) PORTFOLIO VALUATION:                                                         
Fund investments are recorded at market value. Portfolio securities listed on a 
domestic or foreign exchange are valued at the last sale price on the day of    
valuation or, if there was no sale that day, at the last reported mean price as 
of the close of trading. Equity securities traded on NASDAQ use the official    
closing price. Equity securities which are traded in the over-the-counter market
only, but which are not included on NASDAQ, are valued at the last sale price on
the day of valuation. Debt securities with a remaining maturity of sixty days or
more are valued using a pricing service when such prices are believed to reflect
fair market value. Debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than sixty 
days are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. All other   
securities and securities with no readily determinable market values are valued 
using procedures determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.            

2) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:                               
For financial reporting purposes, portfolio security transactions are recorded  
on trade date. Net realized gains or losses on sales of securities are          
determined by the identified cost method. Interest income, adjusted for         
accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, is recorded on the accrual 
basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain 
dividends from foreign securities are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed  
of the ex-dividend date, if the ex-dividend date has passed.                    

*For additional information regarding the Fund's valuation of investments and   
other significant accounting policies, please refer to the most recent annual 
or semi-annual report.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD NO. 157                              
--------------------------------------------------                              

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards  
("SFAS") No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This standard establishes a single 
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair 
value, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS  
No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by     
existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued   
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within  
those fiscal years. The changes to current GAAP from the application of this    
Statement relate to the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure   
fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.         

One key component of the implementation of SFAS 157 included the development of 
a three-tier fair value hierarchy. The basis of the tiers is dependant upon the 
various "inputs" used to determine the value of the Funds' investments. These   
inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:                   
o Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.       
o Level 2 - other significant inputs (including quoted prices of similar
securities, interest rates, prepayments speeds, credit risk, etc.)  
o Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own   
assumptions in determining the fair value of investments.)          

The inputs or methodology used to for valuing securities are not necessarily an 
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. For       
example, money market securities are valued using amortized cost, in accordance 
with rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Generally, amortized cost  
approximates the current fair value of a security, but since the valuation is   
not obtained from a quoted price in an active market, such securities are       
reflected as Level 2.                                                           

The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the following Funds' net 
assets as of July 31, 2008:
