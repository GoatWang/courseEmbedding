Gold Fundamentals
Silver Fundamentals








Gold is the most malleable metal. It is dense, soft and ductile and its properties remain without tarnishing when exposed to air or water.



Applications
Due to its unique properties and luster, gold has found applications in fabrication, jewelry, coinage and dentistry.


Jewelry fabrication
declined 21% in 2016, primarily due to lower demand from India and China.


Electronics
use of gold declined a modest 2% in 2016, while it was supported by stronger demand for plating salts and a stabilizing of gold used in bonding wire production.


Official coin fabrication
increased 24%, representing another year of stellar growth, largely due to stronger demand for gold as a safe haven.


Dentistry
demand for gold was 5% lower in 2016. Japan remains the largest market in the dentistry industry, accounting for 50% of global demand.


Other industrial & decorative
demand declined 7% in 2016 due to higher gold prices and fall in offtake from India.

Investment

 Global official coin demand – Coin demand grew by 3% year-on-year in 2016, as the gold price decline towards the end of the year triggered buying activity amongst price-sensitive investors.
Physical bar investment - Demand for bullion bars decreased by 10% year-on-year to 787 tonnes in 2016.
 Exchange Traded Funds - ETF holdings increased by 34% in 2016, with substantial inflows into global ETFs in the first ten months of the year. This performance was the result of strengthened gold prices following increased geopolitical uncertainty and higher market expectations for an increase in US interest rates.


Total identifiable investment, which includes physical bar investment, coins and changes to ETF holdings, gained 52% in 2016 to reach 1,579 tonnes, the highest since 2012. This gain was aided by the increased level of ETF holdings during the first half of the year.

Its success is my success.  We all take initiatives and do the things an owner would do even if it is not in our job description. The bar is high and we hold ourselves individually accountable for our actions.  Silver Standard’s reputation is paramount and we act with integrity to protect it at all times. Because Silver Standard is my company, I care deeply for its people and how we are viewed by shareholders and our communities.




Continuous Improvement
We can always do better. We will continually look to improve process and add value. In all parts of our business we will look to how we can do more with less and think differently in all our solutions. We will do this every day and on every task. We look at mistakes as great opportunities to learn and find a better way of achieving success. We approach our business with clarity, simplicity and energy that will set us above the competition.




Teamwork
The power of a team working together cannot be beaten. Individual excellence is a requirement and when working together, outstanding results are achieved. We have a common purpose, teamwork is built on open communication, genuine co-operation and respect. We work hard on the team to get the right results. We encourage positive input and commit that team members all play their part, no passengers. Feedback is given and accepted with the purpose of making our team better. The result is a spirit and vitality unique to Silver Standard.




Accountability Trust & Verification
With accountability comes responsibility, the best decisions come from involving the right people. We trust our people and they in turn welcome transparency and seek input from both line and functional experts to make good business decisions. Good governance is key to a successful organization and we are all working to the same goal. We provide oversight and guidance to our business through verification of how and what we achieve, this is key for our success.




Delivering Results
Our success is based on what we deliver as measured by our shareholders. Success requires us to passionately plan, execute with a sense of urgency and focus on detail in all we do. How we do things is important and we know that delivery matters. We will deliver results by finding new opportunities, building and operating mines and excelling in all the functions of our business.

It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: SSO) and on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ: SSRI). The company owns and operates the Pirquitas mine in Jujuy, Argentina, which is one of the largest primary silver mines in the world. Pirquitas achieved commercial production in December 2009. In 2012, the mine produced 8.6 million ounces of silver, exceeding production guidance for the year, and is expected to produce up to 8.5 million ounces of silver in 2013. Silver Standard also has two wholly owned feasibility stage projects, Pitarrilla in Mexico and San Luis in Peru.[1] On July 12, 2005, Silver Standard Resources Inc. reported the remaining outstanding drilling results from the Berenguela project located five kilometers east of Santa Lucia on the altiplano of southern Peru.[2]
In 2016 Silver Standard generated cash from operations totaling $170.7 million as well as net earnings of $65 million. The Company produced a record 393,325 gold equivalent ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $923 per payable gold equivalent ounce. [3]
Active Mines[edit]
Marigold
On February 4, 2014, it was announced that Silver Standard purchased the Marigold mine, located in Nevada, approximately 64 kilometers southeast the town of Winnemucca. The mine was jointly owned by Vancouver-based Goldcorp Inc. and Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corporation. Goldcorp was the operator of the mine with a 66.7% ownership stake, while Barrick owned the other 33.3%. Both companies released statements with the announcement saying that the reason for the sale was to strengthen their companies respective portfolios and to focus on their "core assets". The deal, which closed by April 4, 2014, reported to be for $275 million. Marigold is an oxide open pit, Carlin Type, gold deposit with heap leach pad recovery methods. in 2015 Marigold broke their record for production by producing 207,006 ounces of gold in one year, historically unprecedented in the mine's history since active mining began in 1989.[4][5]
Pirquitas The Pirquitas Mine is a 100% owned property located in the Province of Jujuy, northern Argentina. It is positioned at an elevation of 4,100 meters above sea level and is accessible by all-weather roads. The mine achieved commercial production on December 1, 2009. It is an open-pit mine utilizing a fleet of 100-tonne trucks and three loading units. Ore is crushed and treated in a gravity pre-concentrator prior to the processing in a conventional mineral flotation plant. The silver and zinc concentrates produced from the plant are shipped to third party smelters.[6]
Other Projects[edit]
Pitarrilla
The Pitarrilla Project is a 100% owned grassroots discovery made by Silver Standard in 2002, located approximately 160 kilometres north-northwest of the city of Durango within the State of Durango, Mexico. A paved roadway extends to within 47 kilometres of the plant site. Pitarrilla is a silver, lead, and zinc project, which will consist of a large open-pit mainly recovering oxidized ores in the early years of production and then predominantly sulphide ores from the deeper parts of the deposit.[7]
San Luis
San Luis is a 100% owned project, located in the Ancash Department, central Peru. The Company acquired the remaining interest in the Project, held by joint venture partner Esperanza Resources Corp., in the third quarter of 2011. The San Luis Project is centered on a high-grade, gold-silver vein, the Ayelén Vein, which was discovered in 2005. The Project is approximately 25 kilometers northwest of Barrick Gold Corporation's Pierina gold mine.[8]

We provide oversight and guidance to our business through verification of how and what we achieve, this is key for our success.




Delivering Results

Silver standard

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the monetary standard. For the standards of millesimal fineness for the silver alloy used in the manufacture or crafting of silver objects, see Silver standards.
The silver standard[a] is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver. The silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the Byzantine Empire until the 19th century. Following the discovery in the 16th century of large deposits of silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, Bolivia, an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the Spanish pieces of eight. These silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years.
In 1704, following Queen Anne's proclamation, the British West Indies became one of the first regions to adopt a gold standard in conjunction with the Spanish gold doubloon coin. In 1717, the master of the Royal Mint, Sir Isaac Newton, introduced a new mint ratio as between silver and gold, and this had the effect of putting Britain onto a de facto gold standard. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom introduced the gold sovereign coin and formally adopted a gold standard in 1821. At the same time, revolutions in Latin America interrupted the supply of silver dollars (pieces of eight) that were being produced at the mints in Potosi, Mexico, and Lima, Peru. The British gold standard initially extended to some of the British colonies, including the Australasian and Southern African colonies, but not to its North American colonies, British India, or to Southeast Asia. The Province of Canada adopted a gold standard in 1853, as did Newfoundland in 1865. In 1873, Imperial Germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin. The United States changed over to gold de facto in the same year, and over the next 35 years, all other nations changed to gold, leaving only China and the British colonies of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei on the silver standard. The silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong in 1935.

Relative value of silver and gold[edit]
Since the time that silver was discovered by the Spanish in the New World in the 16th, until the latter half of the 19th century, the value of gold in relation to silver, maintained a relatively stable ratio of 15½/1. The reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to Germany's decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in 1871. On 23 November 1871, following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity, and then proceeded to move Germany towards a new gold standard which came about on 9 July 1873 with the introduction of the gold mark.[1]
It has also however been suggested by Nevada Senator John Percival Jones in 1876 in a speech to the US Senate, that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the Latin Monetary Union in 1866. Jones argues that the Latin Monetary Union involved a partial demonetization of silver.
Silver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the 20th century, such that the silver dollar coins of the Straits Settlements and silver peso coins of the Philippines had to be made smaller in size, and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value. An even larger rise in the price of silver after the First World War caused the Royal Mint in London to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage. But silver never returned to the 15½/1 ratio of the first half of the 19th century, and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold. Nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold, although variable, is more of the order of 70/1.[2]
Bohemia[edit]
Beginning in 1515, silver coins were minted at the silver mines at Joachimsthal - Jáchymov (St. Joachim's Valley) in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. Although formally called Guldengroschen, they became known as Joachimsthalers, then shortened to thaler.[3] The coins were widely circulated, and became the model for silver thalers issued by other European countries. The word thaler became dollar in the English language.
China[edit]
China had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange, along with the cast copper-alloy cash. The use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). But prior to the Song Dynasty (960-1279), those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth. During the Song dynasty, for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after 1024, but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange. In the Shanyuan Treaty, signed with the state of Liao in 1004, Song China agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of 100,000 tael of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk. This was the first time bulk silver in tael (Chinese: 銀兩) was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power. Silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a Chinese shoe during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). This became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries.
The use of silver as money was very established at the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Paper money was first issued in 1375 by the founder Hongwu Emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange. But due to the increasing depreciation, the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in 1436 (1st year of the Zhengtong Emperor). Meanwhile, silver was made much available through foreign trade with the Portuguese and the Spanish, beginning in the 16th century. The great tax reform by the statesman Zhang Juzheng in 1581 (9th year of the Wanli Emperor) simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver. This can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the Ming. However the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the Americas, mainly through the Spanish.
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), silver ingots were still used, but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the Southern coastal region through foreign trade since the mid-Qing era. It was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use vis à vis the foreign silver dollars, which could be counted easily, given their fixed specification and fineness of silver. However, the Qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own. It was not until late Qing, in 1890, that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by Guangdong province. The coin was at par with the Mexican peso, and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces. For these silver coins, the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit, as the denomination of the coins were given as 0.72 tael (specifically: 7 mace and 2 candareens). Note for the treaties signed between the Qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver, except for the Treaty of Nanking, where the silver dollar was indicated. (See the Treaties of Tianjin, Convention of Peking, Treaty of Shimonoseki and Boxer Protocol). It was not until 1910 that the "yuan" (Chinese: 圓, literally "roundness"), was officially announced as the standard monetary unit. The yuan was subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen, and specified as 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. The next year, 1911, the so-called "Great Qing Silver Coin" one yuan (dollar) was issued, but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the Republic.
The silver standard was again adopted and codified in 1914 by the newly established republic, with one yuan still being equal to 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. After the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) unified the country in 1928, the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in 1933, but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished, as one yuan was now equal to 26.6971 grams of 880 fineness silver. In the same year, 1933, while most of the Western countries (especially Britain and USA) had left the gold standard because of the Great Depression, it was said that China almost avoided the depression entirely, mainly due to having stuck to the silver standard.[citation needed] However, the US silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in September 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' "legal note" issues. China would be the last to abandon the silver standard, along with the British crown colony of Hong Kong.
China's use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank "銀行" (literally "silver house" or "silver office") and for the precious metal and jewel dealer "銀樓" (literally "silver building" or "silver shop").
Germany[edit]
After its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), Germany extracted a huge indemnity from France of £200,000,000 in gold, and used it to join Britain on a gold standard. Germany's abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard.
Ancient Greece[edit]
The first metal used as a currency was silver, more than 4,000 years ago, when silver ingots were used in trade. During the heyday of the Athenian empire, the city's silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve "international standard" status in Mediterranean trade.
Hong Kong[edit]
The British colony of Hong Kong would be the last, along with China, to abandon the silver standard in September 1935. Hong Kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the Hong Kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence ("1s 3d") sterling.
India[edit]
The Indian rupee is derived from the Rūpaya, (silver is called rūpa in Sanskrit) in a silver coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545. Since this is around about the same time that the Spanish discovered silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early 1870s. From 1871, the value of silver depreciated relative to gold, due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of Europe and North America, as those countries changed over to the gold standard. This had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the Rupee. Following the Fowler report, India adopted the gold exchange standard in the year 1898, fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence (1s 4d) sterling.[4]
Persia[edit]
The dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the Persians. The Caliphates in the Islamic world adopted these coins, starting with Caliph Abd al-Malik (685–705). Silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the 20th century.
Spain[edit]
Rich deposits of silver in the Spanish colonies of the New World allowed Spain to mint great quantities of silver coins. The Spanish dollar was a Spanish coin, the "real de a ocho" and later peso, worth eight reals (hence the nickname "pieces of eight"), which was widely circulated during the 18th century.
By the American Revolution in 1775, Spanish dollars backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the Continental Congress.[5] In addition to the American dollar, the 8-real coin became the basis for the Chinese yuan.
Great Britain[edit]
Great Britain's early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency, the pound sterling, which traces its origins to before the Middle Ages (see Anglo-Saxon pound), when King Offa of Mercia introduced the silver penny, which copied the denarius of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire.
The early silver pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, King Henry II introduced Tealby penny. English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold noble was put into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816.
In 1663, a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at 44½ to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds). However, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other European countries. British merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold. As a consequence, silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in, leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, 3.3 pounds), rendering silver coins a "token" issue (i.e., not containing their value in precious metal).
The economic power of Great Britain was such that its adoption of a gold standard put pressure on other countries to follow suit.
United States[edit]
The United States adopted a silver standard based on the "Spanish milled dollar" in 1785. This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act, and by the federal government's use of the "Bank of the United States" to hold its reserves, as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the US dollar. This was, in effect, a derivative silver standard, since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency. This began a long series of attempts for America to create a bimetallic standard for the US dollar, which would continue until the 1920s. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, including the Spanish real. Because of the huge debt taken on by the US federal government to finance the Revolutionary War, silver coins struck by the government left circulation, and in 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins.
The US Treasury was put on a strict hard money standard, doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848, which legally separated the accounts of the federal government from the banking system. However the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from England. Following Gresham's law, silver poured into the US, which traded with other silver nations, and gold moved out. In 1853 the US reduced the silver weight of coins, to keep them in circulation, and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage.
In 1857, the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began, as American banks suspended payment in silver, rippling through the very young international financial system of central banks. In 1861 the US government suspended payment in gold and silver, effectively ending the attempts to form a silver standard basis for the dollar. Through the 1860-1871 period, various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made, including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarcity of silver ended.
The combination that produced economic stability was restriction of supply of new notes, a government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and indirectly, a central bank, and a single unit of value. As notes devalued, or silver ceased to circulate as a store of value, or there was a depression, governments demanding specie as payment drained the circulating medium out of the economy. At the same time there was a dramatically expanded need for credit, and large banks were being chartered in various states, including those in Japan by 1872. The need for stability in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed.
The Coinage Act of 1873, enacted by the United States Congress in 1873, embraced the gold standard and de-monetized silver. Western mining interests and others who wanted silver in circulation labeled this measure the "Crime of '73". For about five years, gold was the only metallic standard in the United States until passage of the Bland–Allison Act on February 28, 1878, requiring the US Treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into legal tender coins co-existent with gold coins. Silver Certificate Series 1878 was issued to join the gold certificates already in circulation.
By acts of Congress in 1933, including the Gold Reserve Act and the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the domestic economy was taken off the gold standard and placed on the silver standard for the first time. The Treasury Department was reempowered to issue paper currency redeemable in silver dollars and bullion, thereby divorcing the domestic economy from bimetallism and leaving it on the silver standard, although international settlements were still in gold.[6]
This meant that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury's vaults, the U.S. government could continue to issue money against it. These silver certificates were shredded upon redemption since the redeemed silver was no longer in the Treasury. With the world market price of silver having been in excess of $1.29 per troy ounce since 1960, silver began to flow out of the Treasury at an increasing rate. To slow the drain, President Kennedy ordered a halt to issuing $5 and $10 silver certificates in 1962. That left the $1 silver certificate as the only denomination being issued.
On June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed Public Law 88-36, which marked the beginning of the end for even the $1 silver certificate. The law authorized the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 bills, and revoked the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates (by now limited to the $1 denomination). Because it would be several months before the new $1 Federal Reserve Notes could enter circulation in quantity, there was a need to issue silver certificates in the interim. Because the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 granted the right to issue silver certificates to the president, Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 to delegate that authority to the Treasury Secretary during the transition
Silver certificates continued to be issued until late 1963, when the $1 Federal Reserve Note was released into circulation. For several years, existing silver certificates could be redeemed for silver, but this practice was halted on June 24, 1968
Finally, President Richard Nixon announced[7] that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal, forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards. This announcement was part of the economic measures now known as the "Nixon Shock".
Due to the monetary policy of the U.S Federal Reserve, calls for a return to the gold standard have returned.[citation needed] Some states have chosen to use a loophole in the Federal Reserve act that gives individual states the right to issue currencies of gold or silver coins or rounds.[citation needed] This was done because the Federal Reserve act does not allow them to print their own currency if they wished.[citation needed] As of January 2012, Utah allowed the payment of debt to be settled in silver and gold, and the value of the American silver or gold rounds used was pegged to the price of the given precious metal.[citation needed] Payment in some cases can be requested to be made in silver or gold rounds. As of 2011, eleven other U.S states were currently exploring their options to possibly make similar changes like Utah.[8]

Silver standard

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the monetary standard. For the standards of millesimal fineness for the silver alloy used in the manufacture or crafting of silver objects, see Silver standards.
The silver standard[a] is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver. The silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the Byzantine Empire until the 19th century. Following the discovery in the 16th century of large deposits of silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, Bolivia, an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the Spanish pieces of eight. These silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years.
In 1704, following Queen Anne's proclamation, the British West Indies became one of the first regions to adopt a gold standard in conjunction with the Spanish gold doubloon coin. In 1717, the master of the Royal Mint, Sir Isaac Newton, introduced a new mint ratio as between silver and gold, and this had the effect of putting Britain onto a de facto gold standard. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom introduced the gold sovereign coin and formally adopted a gold standard in 1821. At the same time, revolutions in Latin America interrupted the supply of silver dollars (pieces of eight) that were being produced at the mints in Potosi, Mexico, and Lima, Peru. The British gold standard initially extended to some of the British colonies, including the Australasian and Southern African colonies, but not to its North American colonies, British India, or to Southeast Asia. The Province of Canada adopted a gold standard in 1853, as did Newfoundland in 1865. In 1873, Imperial Germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin. The United States changed over to gold de facto in the same year, and over the next 35 years, all other nations changed to gold, leaving only China and the British colonies of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei on the silver standard. The silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong in 1935.

Relative value of silver and gold[edit]
Since the time that silver was discovered by the Spanish in the New World in the 16th, until the latter half of the 19th century, the value of gold in relation to silver, maintained a relatively stable ratio of 15½/1. The reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to Germany's decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in 1871. On 23 November 1871, following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity, and then proceeded to move Germany towards a new gold standard which came about on 9 July 1873 with the introduction of the gold mark.[1]
It has also however been suggested by Nevada Senator John Percival Jones in 1876 in a speech to the US Senate, that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the Latin Monetary Union in 1866. Jones argues that the Latin Monetary Union involved a partial demonetization of silver.
Silver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the 20th century, such that the silver dollar coins of the Straits Settlements and silver peso coins of the Philippines had to be made smaller in size, and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value. An even larger rise in the price of silver after the First World War caused the Royal Mint in London to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage. But silver never returned to the 15½/1 ratio of the first half of the 19th century, and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold. Nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold, although variable, is more of the order of 70/1.[2]
Bohemia[edit]
Beginning in 1515, silver coins were minted at the silver mines at Joachimsthal - Jáchymov (St. Joachim's Valley) in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. Although formally called Guldengroschen, they became known as Joachimsthalers, then shortened to thaler.[3] The coins were widely circulated, and became the model for silver thalers issued by other European countries. The word thaler became dollar in the English language.
China[edit]
China had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange, along with the cast copper-alloy cash. The use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). But prior to the Song Dynasty (960-1279), those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth. During the Song dynasty, for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after 1024, but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange. In the Shanyuan Treaty, signed with the state of Liao in 1004, Song China agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of 100,000 tael of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk. This was the first time bulk silver in tael (Chinese: 銀兩) was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power. Silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a Chinese shoe during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). This became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries.
The use of silver as money was very established at the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Paper money was first issued in 1375 by the founder Hongwu Emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange. But due to the increasing depreciation, the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in 1436 (1st year of the Zhengtong Emperor). Meanwhile, silver was made much available through foreign trade with the Portuguese and the Spanish, beginning in the 16th century. The great tax reform by the statesman Zhang Juzheng in 1581 (9th year of the Wanli Emperor) simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver. This can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the Ming. However the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the Americas, mainly through the Spanish.
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), silver ingots were still used, but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the Southern coastal region through foreign trade since the mid-Qing era. It was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use vis à vis the foreign silver dollars, which could be counted easily, given their fixed specification and fineness of silver. However, the Qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own. It was not until late Qing, in 1890, that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by Guangdong province. The coin was at par with the Mexican peso, and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces. For these silver coins, the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit, as the denomination of the coins were given as 0.72 tael (specifically: 7 mace and 2 candareens). Note for the treaties signed between the Qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver, except for the Treaty of Nanking, where the silver dollar was indicated. (See the Treaties of Tianjin, Convention of Peking, Treaty of Shimonoseki and Boxer Protocol). It was not until 1910 that the "yuan" (Chinese: 圓, literally "roundness"), was officially announced as the standard monetary unit. The yuan was subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen, and specified as 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. The next year, 1911, the so-called "Great Qing Silver Coin" one yuan (dollar) was issued, but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the Republic.
The silver standard was again adopted and codified in 1914 by the newly established republic, with one yuan still being equal to 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. After the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) unified the country in 1928, the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in 1933, but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished, as one yuan was now equal to 26.6971 grams of 880 fineness silver. In the same year, 1933, while most of the Western countries (especially Britain and USA) had left the gold standard because of the Great Depression, it was said that China almost avoided the depression entirely, mainly due to having stuck to the silver standard.[citation needed] However, the US silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in September 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' "legal note" issues. China would be the last to abandon the silver standard, along with the British crown colony of Hong Kong.
China's use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank "銀行" (literally "silver house" or "silver office") and for the precious metal and jewel dealer "銀樓" (literally "silver building" or "silver shop").
Germany[edit]
After its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), Germany extracted a huge indemnity from France of £200,000,000 in gold, and used it to join Britain on a gold standard. Germany's abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard.
Ancient Greece[edit]
The first metal used as a currency was silver, more than 4,000 years ago, when silver ingots were used in trade. During the heyday of the Athenian empire, the city's silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve "international standard" status in Mediterranean trade.
Hong Kong[edit]
The British colony of Hong Kong would be the last, along with China, to abandon the silver standard in September 1935. Hong Kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the Hong Kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence ("1s 3d") sterling.
India[edit]
The Indian rupee is derived from the Rūpaya, (silver is called rūpa in Sanskrit) in a silver coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545. Since this is around about the same time that the Spanish discovered silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early 1870s. From 1871, the value of silver depreciated relative to gold, due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of Europe and North America, as those countries changed over to the gold standard. This had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the Rupee. Following the Fowler report, India adopted the gold exchange standard in the year 1898, fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence (1s 4d) sterling.[4]
Persia[edit]
The dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the Persians. The Caliphates in the Islamic world adopted these coins, starting with Caliph Abd al-Malik (685–705). Silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the 20th century.
Spain[edit]
Rich deposits of silver in the Spanish colonies of the New World allowed Spain to mint great quantities of silver coins. The Spanish dollar was a Spanish coin, the "real de a ocho" and later peso, worth eight reals (hence the nickname "pieces of eight"), which was widely circulated during the 18th century.
By the American Revolution in 1775, Spanish dollars backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the Continental Congress.[5] In addition to the American dollar, the 8-real coin became the basis for the Chinese yuan.
Great Britain[edit]
Great Britain's early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency, the pound sterling, which traces its origins to before the Middle Ages (see Anglo-Saxon pound), when King Offa of Mercia introduced the silver penny, which copied the denarius of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire.
The early silver pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, King Henry II introduced Tealby penny. English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold noble was put into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816.
In 1663, a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at 44½ to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds). However, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other European countries. British merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold. As a consequence, silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in, leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, 3.3 pounds), rendering silver coins a "token" issue (i.e., not containing their value in precious metal).
The economic power of Great Britain was such that its adoption of a gold standard put pressure on other countries to follow suit.
United States[edit]
The United States adopted a silver standard based on the "Spanish milled dollar" in 1785. This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act, and by the federal government's use of the "Bank of the United States" to hold its reserves, as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the US dollar. This was, in effect, a derivative silver standard, since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency. This began a long series of attempts for America to create a bimetallic standard for the US dollar, which would continue until the 1920s. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, including the Spanish real. Because of the huge debt taken on by the US federal government to finance the Revolutionary War, silver coins struck by the government left circulation, and in 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins.
The US Treasury was put on a strict hard money standard, doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848, which legally separated the accounts of the federal government from the banking system. However the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from England. Following Gresham's law, silver poured into the US, which traded with other silver nations, and gold moved out. In 1853 the US reduced the silver weight of coins, to keep them in circulation, and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage.

The Province of Canada adopted a gold standard in 1853, as did Newfoundland in 1865. In 1873, Imperial Germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin. The United States changed over to gold de facto in the same year, and over the next 35 years, all other nations changed to gold, leaving only China and the British colonies of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei on the silver standard. The silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong in 1935.

Relative value of silver and gold[edit]
Since the time that silver was discovered by the Spanish in the New World in the 16th, until the latter half of the 19th century, the value of gold in relation to silver, maintained a relatively stable ratio of 15½/1. The reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to Germany's decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in 1871. On 23 November 1871, following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity, and then proceeded to move Germany towards a new gold standard which came about on 9 July 1873 with the introduction of the gold mark.[1]
It has also however been suggested by Nevada Senator John Percival Jones in 1876 in a speech to the US Senate, that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the Latin Monetary Union in 1866. Jones argues that the Latin Monetary Union involved a partial demonetization of silver.
Silver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the 20th century, such that the silver dollar coins of the Straits Settlements and silver peso coins of the Philippines had to be made smaller in size, and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value. An even larger rise in the price of silver after the First World War caused the Royal Mint in London to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage. But silver never returned to the 15½/1 ratio of the first half of the 19th century, and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold. Nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold, although variable, is more of the order of 70/1.[2]
Bohemia[edit]
Beginning in 1515, silver coins were minted at the silver mines at Joachimsthal - Jáchymov (St. Joachim's Valley) in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. Although formally called Guldengroschen, they became known as Joachimsthalers, then shortened to thaler.[3] The coins were widely circulated, and became the model for silver thalers issued by other European countries. The word thaler became dollar in the English language.
China[edit]
China had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange, along with the cast copper-alloy cash. The use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). But prior to the Song Dynasty (960-1279), those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth. During the Song dynasty, for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after 1024, but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange. In the Shanyuan Treaty, signed with the state of Liao in 1004, Song China agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of 100,000 tael of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk. This was the first time bulk silver in tael (Chinese: 銀兩) was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power. Silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a Chinese shoe during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). This became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries.
The use of silver as money was very established at the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Paper money was first issued in 1375 by the founder Hongwu Emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange. But due to the increasing depreciation, the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in 1436 (1st year of the Zhengtong Emperor). Meanwhile, silver was made much available through foreign trade with the Portuguese and the Spanish, beginning in the 16th century. The great tax reform by the statesman Zhang Juzheng in 1581 (9th year of the Wanli Emperor) simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver. This can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the Ming. However the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the Americas, mainly through the Spanish.
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), silver ingots were still used, but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the Southern coastal region through foreign trade since the mid-Qing era. It was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use vis à vis the foreign silver dollars, which could be counted easily, given their fixed specification and fineness of silver. However, the Qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own. It was not until late Qing, in 1890, that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by Guangdong province. The coin was at par with the Mexican peso, and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces. For these silver coins, the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit, as the denomination of the coins were given as 0.72 tael (specifically: 7 mace and 2 candareens). Note for the treaties signed between the Qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver, except for the Treaty of Nanking, where the silver dollar was indicated. (See the Treaties of Tianjin, Convention of Peking, Treaty of Shimonoseki and Boxer Protocol). It was not until 1910 that the "yuan" (Chinese: 圓, literally "roundness"), was officially announced as the standard monetary unit. The yuan was subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen, and specified as 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. The next year, 1911, the so-called "Great Qing Silver Coin" one yuan (dollar) was issued, but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the Republic.
The silver standard was again adopted and codified in 1914 by the newly established republic, with one yuan still being equal to 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. After the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) unified the country in 1928, the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in 1933, but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished, as one yuan was now equal to 26.6971 grams of 880 fineness silver. In the same year, 1933, while most of the Western countries (especially Britain and USA) had left the gold standard because of the Great Depression, it was said that China almost avoided the depression entirely, mainly due to having stuck to the silver standard.[citation needed] However, the US silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in September 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' "legal note" issues. China would be the last to abandon the silver standard, along with the British crown colony of Hong Kong.
China's use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank "銀行" (literally "silver house" or "silver office") and for the precious metal and jewel dealer "銀樓" (literally "silver building" or "silver shop").
Germany[edit]
After its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), Germany extracted a huge indemnity from France of £200,000,000 in gold, and used it to join Britain on a gold standard. Germany's abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard.
Ancient Greece[edit]
The first metal used as a currency was silver, more than 4,000 years ago, when silver ingots were used in trade. During the heyday of the Athenian empire, the city's silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve "international standard" status in Mediterranean trade.
Hong Kong[edit]
The British colony of Hong Kong would be the last, along with China, to abandon the silver standard in September 1935. Hong Kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the Hong Kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence ("1s 3d") sterling.
India[edit]
The Indian rupee is derived from the Rūpaya, (silver is called rūpa in Sanskrit) in a silver coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545. Since this is around about the same time that the Spanish discovered silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early 1870s. From 1871, the value of silver depreciated relative to gold, due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of Europe and North America, as those countries changed over to the gold standard. This had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the Rupee. Following the Fowler report, India adopted the gold exchange standard in the year 1898, fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence (1s 4d) sterling.[4]
Persia[edit]
The dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the Persians. The Caliphates in the Islamic world adopted these coins, starting with Caliph Abd al-Malik (685–705). Silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the 20th century.
Spain[edit]
Rich deposits of silver in the Spanish colonies of the New World allowed Spain to mint great quantities of silver coins. The Spanish dollar was a Spanish coin, the "real de a ocho" and later peso, worth eight reals (hence the nickname "pieces of eight"), which was widely circulated during the 18th century.
By the American Revolution in 1775, Spanish dollars backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the Continental Congress.[5] In addition to the American dollar, the 8-real coin became the basis for the Chinese yuan.
Great Britain[edit]
Great Britain's early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency, the pound sterling, which traces its origins to before the Middle Ages (see Anglo-Saxon pound), when King Offa of Mercia introduced the silver penny, which copied the denarius of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire.
The early silver pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, King Henry II introduced Tealby penny. English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold noble was put into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816.
In 1663, a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at 44½ to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds). However, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other European countries. British merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold. As a consequence, silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in, leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, 3.3 pounds), rendering silver coins a "token" issue (i.e., not containing their value in precious metal).
The economic power of Great Britain was such that its adoption of a gold standard put pressure on other countries to follow suit.
United States[edit]
The United States adopted a silver standard based on the "Spanish milled dollar" in 1785. This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act, and by the federal government's use of the "Bank of the United States" to hold its reserves, as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the US dollar. This was, in effect, a derivative silver standard, since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency. This began a long series of attempts for America to create a bimetallic standard for the US dollar, which would continue until the 1920s. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, including the Spanish real. Because of the huge debt taken on by the US federal government to finance the Revolutionary War, silver coins struck by the government left circulation, and in 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins.
The US Treasury was put on a strict hard money standard, doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848, which legally separated the accounts of the federal government from the banking system. However the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from England. Following Gresham's law, silver poured into the US, which traded with other silver nations, and gold moved out. In 1853 the US reduced the silver weight of coins, to keep them in circulation, and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage.
In 1857, the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began, as American banks suspended payment in silver, rippling through the very young international financial system of central banks. In 1861 the US government suspended payment in gold and silver, effectively ending the attempts to form a silver standard basis for the dollar. Through the 1860-1871 period, various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made, including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarcity of silver ended.
The combination that produced economic stability was restriction of supply of new notes, a government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and indirectly, a central bank, and a single unit of value. As notes devalued, or silver ceased to circulate as a store of value, or there was a depression, governments demanding specie as payment drained the circulating medium out of the economy. At the same time there was a dramatically expanded need for credit, and large banks were being chartered in various states, including those in Japan by 1872. The need for stability in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed.
The Coinage Act of 1873, enacted by the United States Congress in 1873, embraced the gold standard and de-monetized silver. Western mining interests and others who wanted silver in circulation labeled this measure the "Crime of '73". For about five years, gold was the only metallic standard in the United States until passage of the Bland–Allison Act on February 28, 1878, requiring the US Treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into legal tender coins co-existent with gold coins. Silver Certificate Series 1878 was issued to join the gold certificates already in circulation.
By acts of Congress in 1933, including the Gold Reserve Act and the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the domestic economy was taken off the gold standard and placed on the silver standard for the first time. The Treasury Department was reempowered to issue paper currency redeemable in silver dollars and bullion, thereby divorcing the domestic economy from bimetallism and leaving it on the silver standard, although international settlements were still in gold.[6]
This meant that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury's vaults, the U.S. government could continue to issue money against it. These silver certificates were shredded upon redemption since the redeemed silver was no longer in the Treasury. With the world market price of silver having been in excess of $1.29 per troy ounce since 1960, silver began to flow out of the Treasury at an increasing rate. To slow the drain, President Kennedy ordered a halt to issuing $5 and $10 silver certificates in 1962. That left the $1 silver certificate as the only denomination being issued.
On June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed Public Law 88-36, which marked the beginning of the end for even the $1 silver certificate. The law authorized the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 bills, and revoked the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates (by now limited to the $1 denomination). Because it would be several months before the new $1 Federal Reserve Notes could enter circulation in quantity, there was a need to issue silver certificates in the interim. Because the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 granted the right to issue silver certificates to the president, Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 to delegate that authority to the Treasury Secretary during the transition
Silver certificates continued to be issued until late 1963, when the $1 Federal Reserve Note was released into circulation. For several years, existing silver certificates could be redeemed for silver, but this practice was halted on June 24, 1968
Finally, President Richard Nixon announced[7] that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal, forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards. This announcement was part of the economic measures now known as the "Nixon Shock".
Due to the monetary policy of the U.S Federal Reserve, calls for a return to the gold standard have returned.[citation needed] Some states have chosen to use a loophole in the Federal Reserve act that gives individual states the right to issue currencies of gold or silver coins or rounds.[citation needed] This was done because the Federal Reserve act does not allow them to print their own currency if they wished.[citation needed] As of January 2012, Utah allowed the payment of debt to be settled in silver and gold, and the value of the American silver or gold rounds used was pegged to the price of the given precious metal.[citation needed] Payment in some cases can be requested to be made in silver or gold rounds. As of 2011, eleven other U.S states were currently exploring their options to possibly make similar changes like Utah.[8]

Silver standard

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the monetary standard. For the standards of millesimal fineness for the silver alloy used in the manufacture or crafting of silver objects, see Silver standards.
The silver standard[a] is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver. The silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the Byzantine Empire until the 19th century. Following the discovery in the 16th century of large deposits of silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, Bolivia, an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the Spanish pieces of eight. These silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years.
In 1704, following Queen Anne's proclamation, the British West Indies became one of the first regions to adopt a gold standard in conjunction with the Spanish gold doubloon coin. In 1717, the master of the Royal Mint, Sir Isaac Newton, introduced a new mint ratio as between silver and gold, and this had the effect of putting Britain onto a de facto gold standard. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom introduced the gold sovereign coin and formally adopted a gold standard in 1821. At the same time, revolutions in Latin America interrupted the supply of silver dollars (pieces of eight) that were being produced at the mints in Potosi, Mexico, and Lima, Peru. The British gold standard initially extended to some of the British colonies, including the Australasian and Southern African colonies, but not to its North American colonies, British India, or to Southeast Asia. The Province of Canada adopted a gold standard in 1853, as did Newfoundland in 1865. In 1873, Imperial Germany changed over to the gold standard in conjunction with the new gold mark coin. The United States changed over to gold de facto in the same year, and over the next 35 years, all other nations changed to gold, leaving only China and the British colonies of Hong Kong and Weihaiwei on the silver standard. The silver standard finally came to an end when it was abandoned by China and Hong Kong in 1935.

Relative value of silver and gold[edit]
Since the time that silver was discovered by the Spanish in the New World in the 16th, until the latter half of the 19th century, the value of gold in relation to silver, maintained a relatively stable ratio of 15½/1. The reason for the subsequent sharp decline in the relative value of silver to gold has been attributed to Germany's decision to cease minting the silver thaler coins in 1871. On 23 November 1871, following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck exacted one billion dollars in gold indemnity, and then proceeded to move Germany towards a new gold standard which came about on 9 July 1873 with the introduction of the gold mark.[1]
It has also however been suggested by Nevada Senator John Percival Jones in 1876 in a speech to the US Senate, that the downward pressure on the market value of silver began somewhat earlier with the formation of the Latin Monetary Union in 1866. Jones argues that the Latin Monetary Union involved a partial demonetization of silver.
Silver made a partial comeback in the first decade of the 20th century, such that the silver dollar coins of the Straits Settlements and silver peso coins of the Philippines had to be made smaller in size, and with a reduced silver content in order to prevent their silver value exceeding their recently established gold exchange value. An even larger rise in the price of silver after the First World War caused the Royal Mint in London to reduce the silver content of the sterling coinage. But silver never returned to the 15½/1 ratio of the first half of the 19th century, and the predominant long term trend was that silver continued to decline in value against gold. Nowadays the ratio in relation to the value of gold, although variable, is more of the order of 70/1.[2]
Bohemia[edit]
Beginning in 1515, silver coins were minted at the silver mines at Joachimsthal - Jáchymov (St. Joachim's Valley) in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. Although formally called Guldengroschen, they became known as Joachimsthalers, then shortened to thaler.[3] The coins were widely circulated, and became the model for silver thalers issued by other European countries. The word thaler became dollar in the English language.
China[edit]
China had long used silver ingots as a medium of exchange, along with the cast copper-alloy cash. The use of silver ingots can be traced back as far as the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). But prior to the Song Dynasty (960-1279), those silver ingots were used mainly for hoarding wealth. During the Song dynasty, for the first time in history the government became the sole issuer of paper currency after 1024, but cast coins and silver ingots were still used as a medium of exchange. In the Shanyuan Treaty, signed with the state of Liao in 1004, Song China agreed to pay an annual indemnity or tribute of 100,000 tael of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk. This was the first time bulk silver in tael (Chinese: 銀兩) was used as indemnity in a treaty with a foreign power. Silver ingots had a shape similar to a boat or a Chinese shoe during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). This became an ordinary shape for silver ingots during the following centuries.
The use of silver as money was very established at the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Paper money was first issued in 1375 by the founder Hongwu Emperor amid the ban of silver as medium of exchange. But due to the increasing depreciation, the paper money became basically worthless and the ban on silver usage was finally lifted in 1436 (1st year of the Zhengtong Emperor). Meanwhile, silver was made much available through foreign trade with the Portuguese and the Spanish, beginning in the 16th century. The great tax reform by the statesman Zhang Juzheng in 1581 (9th year of the Wanli Emperor) simplified the taxation and required all the tax and corvee to be paid in silver. This can be seen as an indication of the firm position of silver in the monetary system of the Ming. However the reform would not have been a success or even feasible if the enormous amounts of silver had not been available through trade and imports from the Americas, mainly through the Spanish.
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), silver ingots were still used, but various foreign silver dollars had become popular in the Southern coastal region through foreign trade since the mid-Qing era. It was apparent that the silver ingots became awkward and more complicated to use vis à vis the foreign silver dollars, which could be counted easily, given their fixed specification and fineness of silver. However, the Qing dynasty very much resisted the idea of minting a silver coin of their own. It was not until late Qing, in 1890, that the first circulating silver coin was introduced by Guangdong province. The coin was at par with the Mexican peso, and soon this issue was emulated by other provinces. For these silver coins, the tael was still seen as the proper monetary unit, as the denomination of the coins were given as 0.72 tael (specifically: 7 mace and 2 candareens). Note for the treaties signed between the Qing dynasty and the foreign powers the indemnities were all in tael of silver, except for the Treaty of Nanking, where the silver dollar was indicated. (See the Treaties of Tianjin, Convention of Peking, Treaty of Shimonoseki and Boxer Protocol). It was not until 1910 that the "yuan" (Chinese: 圓, literally "roundness"), was officially announced as the standard monetary unit. The yuan was subdivided into 10 jiao or 100 fen, and specified as 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. The next year, 1911, the so-called "Great Qing Silver Coin" one yuan (dollar) was issued, but soon after the dynasty was replaced by the Republic.
The silver standard was again adopted and codified in 1914 by the newly established republic, with one yuan still being equal to 0.72 tael of 900 fineness silver. After the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) unified the country in 1928, the yuan was again announced as the standard unit in 1933, but this time the relationship of the yuan to the tael was abolished, as one yuan was now equal to 26.6971 grams of 880 fineness silver. In the same year, 1933, while most of the Western countries (especially Britain and USA) had left the gold standard because of the Great Depression, it was said that China almost avoided the depression entirely, mainly due to having stuck to the silver standard.[citation needed] However, the US silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so in the end the silver standard was officially abandoned in September 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' "legal note" issues. China would be the last to abandon the silver standard, along with the British crown colony of Hong Kong.
China's use of silver as a medium of exchange is reflected in the name for bank "銀行" (literally "silver house" or "silver office") and for the precious metal and jewel dealer "銀樓" (literally "silver building" or "silver shop").
Germany[edit]
After its victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), Germany extracted a huge indemnity from France of £200,000,000 in gold, and used it to join Britain on a gold standard. Germany's abandonment of the silver standard put further pressure on other countries to move to the gold standard.
Ancient Greece[edit]
The first metal used as a currency was silver, more than 4,000 years ago, when silver ingots were used in trade. During the heyday of the Athenian empire, the city's silver tetradrachm was the first coin to achieve "international standard" status in Mediterranean trade.
Hong Kong[edit]
The British colony of Hong Kong would be the last, along with China, to abandon the silver standard in September 1935. Hong Kong then adopted the gold exchange standard and the Hong Kong dollar took on the exact value of one shilling and three pence ("1s 3d") sterling.
India[edit]
The Indian rupee is derived from the Rūpaya, (silver is called rūpa in Sanskrit) in a silver coin introduced by Sher Shah Suri during his reign from 1540 to 1545. Since this is around about the same time that the Spanish discovered silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, the silver value of the rupee maintained a stable relationship with gold right up until the early 1870s. From 1871, the value of silver depreciated relative to gold, due to the drop in demand for silver in the mints of Europe and North America, as those countries changed over to the gold standard. This had severe consequences for the rupee and it resulted in the fall of the Rupee. Following the Fowler report, India adopted the gold exchange standard in the year 1898, fixing the value of the rupee at exactly one shilling and four pence (1s 4d) sterling.[4]
Persia[edit]
The dirham was a silver coin originally minted by the Persians. The Caliphates in the Islamic world adopted these coins, starting with Caliph Abd al-Malik (685–705). Silver remained the most common monetary metal used in ordinary transactions until the 20th century.
Spain[edit]
Rich deposits of silver in the Spanish colonies of the New World allowed Spain to mint great quantities of silver coins. The Spanish dollar was a Spanish coin, the "real de a ocho" and later peso, worth eight reals (hence the nickname "pieces of eight"), which was widely circulated during the 18th century.
By the American Revolution in 1775, Spanish dollars backed paper money authorized by the individual colonies and the Continental Congress.[5] In addition to the American dollar, the 8-real coin became the basis for the Chinese yuan.
Great Britain[edit]
Great Britain's early use of the silver standard is still reflected in the name of its currency, the pound sterling, which traces its origins to before the Middle Ages (see Anglo-Saxon pound), when King Offa of Mercia introduced the silver penny, which copied the denarius of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire.
The early silver pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, King Henry II introduced Tealby penny. English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold noble was put into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816.
In 1663, a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at 44½ to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds). However, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver compared to other European countries. British merchants sent silver abroad in payments while exports were paid for with gold. As a consequence, silver flowed out of the country and gold flowed in, leading to a situation where Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, 3.3 pounds), rendering silver coins a "token" issue (i.e., not containing their value in precious metal).
The economic power of Great Britain was such that its adoption of a gold standard put pressure on other countries to follow suit.
United States[edit]
The United States adopted a silver standard based on the "Spanish milled dollar" in 1785. This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act, and by the federal government's use of the "Bank of the United States" to hold its reserves, as well as establishing a fixed ratio of gold to the US dollar. This was, in effect, a derivative silver standard, since the bank was not required to keep silver to back all of its currency. This began a long series of attempts for America to create a bimetallic standard for the US dollar, which would continue until the 1920s. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, including the Spanish real. Because of the huge debt taken on by the US federal government to finance the Revolutionary War, silver coins struck by the government left circulation, and in 1806 President Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins.
The US Treasury was put on a strict hard money standard, doing business only in gold or silver coin as part of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848, which legally separated the accounts of the federal government from the banking system. However the fixed rate of gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or borrow from England. Following Gresham's law, silver poured into the US, which traded with other silver nations, and gold moved out. In 1853 the US reduced the silver weight of coins, to keep them in circulation, and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage.
In 1857, the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began, as American banks suspended payment in silver, rippling through the very young international financial system of central banks. In 1861 the US government suspended payment in gold and silver, effectively ending the attempts to form a silver standard basis for the dollar. Through the 1860-1871 period, various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made, including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarcity of silver ended.
The combination that produced economic stability was restriction of supply of new notes, a government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and indirectly, a central bank, and a single unit of value. As notes devalued, or silver ceased to circulate as a store of value, or there was a depression, governments demanding specie as payment drained the circulating medium out of the economy. At the same time there was a dramatically expanded need for credit, and large banks were being chartered in various states, including those in Japan by 1872. The need for stability in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of the gold standard in the period that followed.
The Coinage Act of 1873, enacted by the United States Congress in 1873, embraced the gold standard and de-monetized silver. Western mining interests and others who wanted silver in circulation labeled this measure the "Crime of '73". For about five years, gold was the only metallic standard in the United States until passage of the Bland–Allison Act on February 28, 1878, requiring the US Treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into legal tender coins co-existent with gold coins. Silver Certificate Series 1878 was issued to join the gold certificates already in circulation.
By acts of Congress in 1933, including the Gold Reserve Act and the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the domestic economy was taken off the gold standard and placed on the silver standard for the first time. The Treasury Department was reempowered to issue paper currency redeemable in silver dollars and bullion, thereby divorcing the domestic economy from bimetallism and leaving it on the silver standard, although international settlements were still in gold.[6]
This meant that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury's vaults, the U.S. government could continue to issue money against it. These silver certificates were shredded upon redemption since the redeemed silver was no longer in the Treasury. With the world market price of silver having been in excess of $1.29 per troy ounce since 1960, silver began to flow out of the Treasury at an increasing rate. To slow the drain, President Kennedy ordered a halt to issuing $5 and $10 silver certificates in 1962. That left the $1 silver certificate as the only denomination being issued.
On June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed Public Law 88-36, which marked the beginning of the end for even the $1 silver certificate. The law authorized the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 bills, and revoked the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates (by now limited to the $1 denomination). Because it would be several months before the new $1 Federal Reserve Notes could enter circulation in quantity, there was a need to issue silver certificates in the interim. Because the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 granted the right to issue silver certificates to the president, Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 to delegate that authority to the Treasury Secretary during the transition
Silver certificates continued to be issued until late 1963, when the $1 Federal Reserve Note was released into circulation. For several years, existing silver certificates could be redeemed for silver, but this practice was halted on June 24, 1968
Finally, President Richard Nixon announced[7] that the United States would no longer redeem currency for gold or any other precious metal, forming the final step in abandoning the gold and silver standards. This announcement was part of the economic measures now known as the "Nixon Shock".
Due to the monetary policy of the U.S Federal Reserve, calls for a return to the gold standard have returned.[citation needed] Some states have chosen to use a loophole in the Federal Reserve act that gives individual states the right to issue currencies of gold or silver coins or rounds.[citation needed] This was done because the Federal Reserve act does not allow them to print their own currency if they wished.[citation needed] As of January 2012, Utah allowed the payment of debt to be settled in silver and gold, and the value of the American silver or gold rounds used was pegged to the price of the given precious metal.[citation needed] Payment in some cases can be requested to be made in silver or gold rounds. As of 2011, eleven other U.S states were currently exploring their options to possibly make similar changes like Utah.[8]

4 Little Things Silver Standard Resources Inc. Does Right, and the Big Result
Precious-metals miner Silver Standard Resources focused on little things, and achieved impressively big results.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)

Silver and gold miner Silver Standard Resources Inc. (NASDAQ:SSRI) reacted to the commodity downturn like most in the precious metals industry -- it cut costs. The overall performance of the company is pretty impressive on this front, too. However, it's the little things that added up to big savings. Here's a quick analysis of what Silver Standard did right at one of its key mines.
The big picture
Between 2014 and 2016 Silver Standard was able to reduce its cash costs per gold equivalent ounce from $810 to $653. That's an impressive 24% decrease in the underlying cost of operating its mines. This is the biggest piece of all-in sustaining costs, a broader measure that includes the capital spending needed to sustain production. For example, Silver Standard's all-in sustaining costs at its Marigold mine were up 7% year over year in 2016, partly because of the construction of a new leach pad. Cash costs, meanwhile, were roughly 6.5% lower.

So cash costs can give you a good idea of how efficiently a miner is running its mines. But it's important to remember that cash costs are a top-level number; there's a lot that goes on underneath that figure. This is why it's worth looking at some of the little things that Silver Standard has been doing, to see how they've added up to a 24% difference between 2014 and 2016.
The minutiae
One of the little changes that Silver Standard implemented is known as a "hot shift change." That sounds a lot more exciting than it really is, but it helped the company reduce its hauling costs by 23% between 2014 and 2016 at its Marigold mine. What used to happen during a shift change was that drivers would turn off their vehicles, with the thought that it would reduce wear and tear on the engines and save fuel. However, engine technology has advanced notably, and now the trucks are left running while the shifts change. This ultimately reduces equipment downtime and, thus, increases productivity. Leaving trucks running sounds like a silly thing, but the savings clearly add up.
Another notable change was the decision to reduce the number of drills the company used at Marigold from six to four. With less gear, Silver Standard was forced to use its remaining drills more efficiently, effectively getting more out of each machine. The impact was a 17% reduction in the cost per foot drilled.

Silver Standard also changed its blasting patterns, blasting products, and loading sequence at Marigold. How things work together at a mine is a giant jigsaw puzzle. You or I might view it as a logistical nightmare trying to figure out what needs to be where and when. But moving the pieces around a little helped the miner trim its blasting costs by 24% between 2014 and 2016. An outsider might not even notice the logistics change, but it obviously led to impressive results.
The last interesting change involved transferring the skills of a key employee to peers. The company asked the most effective shovel operator at Marigold to help train the other shovel operators, sharing best practices. It was another small change, but one that led to a 13% drop in the rope-shovel cost per tonne as the trainees adopted the new techniques they'd been shown.

Under the hood
Mine costs ebb and flow for many reasons, including the age of a mine and the shifting geology of a site as material is dug up, so it wouldn't be surprising to see mine costs go up at Silver Standard in the future. But it's really easy to take big-picture numbers like cash costs and forget all the work that's going on beneath.
Indeed, little things like "hot shift changes" and sharing best practices can really start to add up, even though they are easy to miss. That's a mistake, because small changes like these highlight the focus Silver Standard has made on ensuring its operations run lean and mean. But the best part is that many of the changes noted here will have a lingering impact even if other pieces of the mining puzzle push costs up for a spell. In fact, next time you see big-picture numbers like cash costs and all-in sustaining costs, don't just move on to the next factoid; take a moment to read and understand what's driving the figure up or down. It could be more material than you think.

Why Silver Standard Resources Inc. Shareholders Have Something to Worry About
Silver Standard made a key acquisition in 2016 to boost its production outlook, but only if it pans out as planned...











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Apr 25, 2017 at 9:27AM
            
            





Precious metals miner Silver Standard Resources Inc. (NASDAQ:SSRI) made a bold move in 2016 to solidify its future. Indeed, a single acquisition materially improved the gold and silver company's long-term outlook and at an important time. However, if first quarter production numbers are any indication, Silver Standard has a lot riding on its new mine. And that's something that shareholders should be worried about.
The bee in the sea
Silver Standard's big acquisition in 2016 was the purchase of Claude Resources. The roughly $300 million deal added Claude's Seabee and Santoy mines in Canada to Silver Standard's core assets, bringing the miner up to three working mines. The new mines were desirable because of their relatively low costs and high grade operations. Claude's low debt and cash balance also led to to an improvement in Silver Standard's financial profile.

It was a pretty good deal all around. And Silver Standard quickly worked to make it even better by signing a deal with Eagle Plains Resources to explore land contiguous with Silver Standard's new SeaBee property. This is, perhaps, the more telling transaction because it hints at the growth potential that the Claude transaction offers. 
In the nick of time
But here's the thing, Silver Standard's other mines aren't exactly hitting it out of the park production wise. For example, in 2016 the Marigold mine saw gold production decline nearly 1%. And the Pirquitas mine saw silver production increase by a little under 1%. Not much to write home about if you are looking to invest in a miner that's growing its business.     

The Seabee mine.  Image source: Silver Standard Resources Inc.

And the numbers aren't expected to get better in 2017. For example, Marigold's gold production is expected to be flat to up around 5%. That said, Marigold's first quarter production was down nearly 8% year over year -- not an auspicious start. But that was a lot better than the roughly 30% silver production decline at Pirquitas. That said, Silver Standard just inked a deal to expand its exploration opportunities at Pirquitas that should lead to a production pickup from those dismal numbers. But the main point doesn't change, these two mines aren't growth engines.   
Which is why investors should be worried. Essentially, Silver Standard has bet a lot of its future on the Seabee mine. Because it only owned the mine for part of the year in 2016, Seabee produced just 46,570 ounces of gold for Silver Standard. It's expecting full-year production of 72,000 to 82,000 ounces in 2017.   

The Seabee Mine at a glance.  Image source: Silver Standard Resources Inc.

So there's a nice bump right there, but it gets better. Seabee produced roughly 7% more gold in the first quarter than it did in the fourth quarter. That led CEO Paul Benson to note that, "Our production of 97,851 gold equivalent ounces is a strong start to the year, highlighted by Seabee continuing to demonstrate a capability to produce above historical levels." Those kind of results are going to be needed on an ongoing basis if Silver Standard hopes to keep production growing.





Not the end of the world
The big takeaway here isn't that Silver Standard Resources is in some dire danger. The deal to extend the mine life of Pirquitas is a clear demonstration that there are other avenues available to the miner to support growth. However, it still has a lot riding on the Seabee mine. And that means investors need to watch the progress at that mine very carefully. If something goes wrong or the expansion opportunities there prove less than compelling, you'll have something really notable to start worrying about.

In 2016, the Marigold mine produced 205,116 ounces, compared to 207,006 ounces of gold produced in 2015, achieving the mid-point of our improved 2016 production guidance.  Gold sales were 204,315 ounces for the year. 
Total material mined and ore stacked on leach pads of 75.1 million tonnes and 23.6 million tonnes, respectively, in 2016, were record amounts for the Marigold mine, due to the increased hauling capacity added to the fleet earlier in the year. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, Marigold produced 59,945 ounces of gold, 26% higher than the previous quarter as expected, due to higher grade ore tonnes sourced from the deeper benches of the current Mackay pit phase during the third and fourth quarters of 2016.  Higher grade ore was placed on the new leach pad, completed in the third quarter of 2016, which assisted in accelerated gold recovery. Gold sales totaled 61,308 ounces for the quarter. 
A total of 19.6 million tonnes of material were mined in the fourth quarter of 2016, in line with material mined in the third quarter. Approximately 6.4 million tonnes of ore were delivered to the heap leach pads at a gold grade of 0.48 g/t, containing approximately 75,000 recoverable ounces of gold stacked during the quarter. This compares to 4.8 million tonnes of ore delivered to the heap leach pads at a gold grade of 0.42 g/t in the third quarter of 2016, containing approximately 47,000 recoverable ounces of gold. Gold grade mined in the fourth quarter was 14% higher than the third quarter. The strip ratio declined to 2.0:1 in the quarter, a 36% reduction compared to the previous quarter.

The data presented in this column is for the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and includes operating results for the Seabee Gold Operation for the period from January 1, 2016 to May 30, 2016 prior to our acquisition.

 
The Seabee Gold Operation consists of the Seabee and Santoy underground mines, both of which feed a single processing facility. During the period since acquisition, from May 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the mine produced a total of 46,574 ounces of gold with gold sales of 50,445 ounces. For the full year 2016, production totaled 77,640 ounces of gold, marking record annual production since the beginning of operations in 1991.  
In the fourth quarter, the Seabee Gold Operation produced 19,711 ounces of gold, largely in line with the 20,142 ounces of gold produced during the third quarter of 2016. Production during the second half of the year of 39,853 ounces of gold exceeded our second half 2016 production guidance range of 32,000 to 35,000 ounces of gold. 
A record 84,526 tonnes of ore were milled at an average gold grade of 7.40 g/t and recovery of 97.0% during the fourth quarter. This compares to a total of 82,756 tonnes of ore milled at an average gold grade of 7.40 g/t and recovery of 96.5% in the third quarter. Gold sales totaled 17,229 ounces during the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, the mill was maintained at a higher throughput of 919 tonnes per day, a record quarterly performance. The Santoy complex mined approximately 92% of total ore milled, with the remainder mined from Seabee. Mining continues to transition to long hole stope ore from Santoy and we are reviewing the mine plan to determine the feasibility of higher, sustainable production rates in excess of our 2017 Outlook.

Notes: 



1.    Percent changes are calculated using rounded numbers presented in the table.

 
In 2016, the Pirquitas mine produced a record 10.4 million ounces of silver, close to the upper end of our increased annual production guidance range. This was largely the result of achieving a 14% increase in daily milling rate during the year. Silver mined grade of 183 g/t was in line with that realized in 2015, while silver mill feed grade was 6% lower than the previous year, in line with expectations as medium grade stockpiled ore supplemented the mill feed. Silver recovery of 77.8% was lower compared to 2015, due to a combination of closing down the zinc circuit in January 2016, lower silver grade throughout the year and higher mill throughput in the latter half of 2016. Silver sales totaled 11.4 million ounces for the year.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, Pirquitas production declined relative to the third quarter, as expected, producing 2.2 million ounces of silver. Silver sales totaled 2.6 million ounces for the quarter.
Ore was milled at an average rate of 5,175 tonnes per day in the fourth quarter, 5% higher than the previous quarter and a record quarterly result. Additionally, the average milling rate was 29% above the mill's nominal design of 4,000 tonnes per day, which is the result of a successful 14-month operational excellence project. Ore milled in the fourth quarter of 2016 contained an average silver grade of 194 g/t, 27% lower than the 264 g/t reported in the third quarter as the availability of ore in the lower benches of the San Miguel open pit was reduced, resulting in medium grade stockpile ore supplementing mill feed. 
The average silver recovery in the fourth quarter was 74.5%, lower than the 79.0% recovery in the previous quarter, in line with reduced silver mill feed grade that resulted from the increasing proportion of stockpiled material in the mill feed.
Detailed planning and consultation with the workforce, union, communities and government for the cessation of open pit mining in January 2017 is well-advanced. Thereafter, medium grade stockpile material will be processed through the plant in 2017. Low grade stockpiles may be processed in late 2017, and potentially in early 2018, depending on prevailing economic conditions.
2017 Outlook
This section of the news release provides management's production and cost estimates. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

We report the non-GAAP financial measures of cash costs per payable ounce of silver and gold sold to manage and evaluate operating performance at the Marigold mine, the Seabee Gold Operation and the Pirquitas mine. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Measures".



2.


Includes capitalized and expensed exploration expenses.

 
In 2017, on a consolidated basis at mid-point of guidance, Silver Standard expects to produce 355,000 gold equivalent ounces at gold equivalent cash costs of $735 per ounce. Cash costs and capital guidance are based on $55 per barrel oil price and 1.30 Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Gold equivalent figures are based on a $1,250 per ounce gold price and a $17.50 per ounce silver price.   
Marigold production is expected to increase compared to 2016 as the mine benefits from the gold ounces stacked on the leach pads through the latter months of 2016 and from continued strong performance in 2017. As a result, production is expected to be weighted towards the first half of the year. Capital expenditures total $30 million and are primarily attributable to mining equipment components of $17 million and replacement of support equipment of $5 million, with $2.5 million allocated for permitting. Capitalized stripping is expected to decline significantly relative to 2016 as mining focuses on the current phases of the Mackay pit. Approximately $11 million of capitalized stripping are expected to be incurred in the second half of the year as we commence stripping of the next phase of the Mackay pit. 
Despite the decline in mining costs capitalized, cash costs per payable ounce are expected to be similar to 2016.
At the Seabee Gold Operation, 2017 will mark our first full year of ownership with production expected to remain near record levels of between 72,000 and 82,000 ounces of gold at low cash costs, based on mill throughput of 900 tonnes per day. Annual production is expected to be weighted toward the second half of the year as mine grade is expected to increase as additional levels are developed at the Santoy mine complex through early 2017. Capital investments at Seabee of $8 million include $2 million for improvement of gravity recovery in the plant, $2 million for ventilation improvements to the Santoy mine complex to support a higher mining rate and $3 million for a water treatment plant related to tailings water discharge. Capitalized development of $11 million is principally for Santoy decline development 
and to establish stations for underground definition and exploration drilling.
At the Pirquitas mine, as previously disclosed, mining of the San Miguel open pit is expected to cease in January 2017. Medium grade stockpiles are expected to constitute the mill feed upon cessation of open pit mining activities. As a result, silver production is expected to decline and cash costs are expected to be higher in 2017, compared to 2016. Zinc production is not expected in 2017 due to lower zinc grades in the stockpiled material. As we report cash costs on a per payable ounce sold basis, 2017 expected cash costs include stockpile inventory costs of approximately $3.50 per ounce of silver that were previously incurred. Capital expenditures include approximately $1 million for completion of the tailings facility lift, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2017. The 
remaining sustaining capital is for maintaining the re-handle fleet and the mill in fully operational condition.  Further, we expect to incur approximately $6 million related to remediation of mining areas in 2017, mainly on surface water control measures. The Pirquitas plant is expected to operate through 2017, conditional upon profitable processing of stockpiles at prevailing market conditions, and to close in late 2017 or early 2018, subject to our investment decision on the Chinchillas project. 
We continue to evaluate our right to exercise our option to form a joint venture on the Chinchillas project as an opportunity to extend the mine life at Pirquitas. The completion of our technical evaluation combined with the assessment of market conditions and country risk factors, including the status of our export duty litigation, will determine our decision on exercising the option in advance of its expiry on March 30, 2017.
Exploration and development expenditures are forecast at $15 million.  Approximately $5 million of exploration at Marigold is for Mineral Resource discovery and conversion of Mineral Resources to Reserves with particular focus on the Valmy property. At the Seabee Gold Operation, $5 million of expenditures are to be incurred targeting Mineral Resource discovery and conversion of Mineral Resources to Reserves, including Mineral Resource discovery contiguous to Seabee at the Fisher property, where we hold an option.  The remaining expenditures are attributable to our development portfolio, including $1 million at the Perdito early-stage exploration property.

Report on Form 40-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are based on what our management considers to be reasonable assumptions, beliefs, expectations and opinions based on the information currently available to it. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, our ability to carry on our exploration and development activities, our ability to meet our obligations under our property agreements, the timing and results of drilling programs, the discovery of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves on our mineral properties, the timely receipt of required approvals and permits, including those approvals and permits required for successful project permitting, construction and operation of our projects, the price of the minerals we produce, the costs of operating and exploration expenditures, our ability 
to operate in a safe, efficient and effective manner, our ability to obtain financing as and when required and on reasonable terms and our ability to continue operating the Marigold mine, the Seabee Gold Operation and the Pirquitas mine. You are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which may have been used. We cannot assure you that actual events, performance or results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements, and management's assumptions may prove to be incorrect. Our forward-looking statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date hereof and we do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change other than as required by applicable law. For the reasons set 
forth above, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors
This news release includes Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources classification terms that comply with reporting standards in Canada and the Mineral Reserves and the Mineral Resources estimates are made in accordance with NI 43-101. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC set out in SEC Industry Guide 7. Consequently, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic U.S. reporting companies subject to the 
reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC. Under SEC standards, mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Moreover, the requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of "reserves" are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by us in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as "reserves" under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.
Cautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Measures
This news release includes certain terms or performance measures commonly used in the mining industry that are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), including cash costs per payable ounce of precious metals sold and realized metal prices. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and, therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. We believe that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance. The data presented is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our consolidated 
financial statements. Readers should refer to "Non-GAAP and Additional GAAP Financial Measures" in section 12 of our most recent MD&A, available under our corporate profile at www.sedar.com or on our website at www.silverstandard.com, for a more detailed discussion of how we calculate such measures and for a reconciliation of such measures to IFRS terms.

Silver Standard Resources Inc Company Profile

   Silver Standard Resources is developing silver mining projects throughout the Americas. Most of its assets are in silver -- it controls proved and probable silver reserves of about 285 million ounces -- with the rest in by-product metals such as gold, tin, and zinc. The company owns and operates the Pirquitas mine in Jujuy, Argentina, which is one of the largest primary silver mines in the world. It also has projects in Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and the US. Also, Silver Standard has a partnership with Minco Silver to explore silver projects in China. In 2013 the firm agreed to sell its San Agustin project in Mexico to Argonaut Gold for approximately $75 million to fund future exploration.
