WORKING PROFILE: ENERGY SECRETARY JOHN S. HERRINGTON
WORKING PROFILE: ENERGY SECRETARY JOHN S. HERRINGTON;   SLAYER OF PLANS HE FINDS TOO COSTLY


By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to the New York Times


Published: August 26, 1985









WASHINGTON, Aug. 25— 
                    In the mid-1960's, a young California lawyer and boxing enthusiast helped organize a syndicate to invest in what he still considers to be ''the fastest, hardest-hitting middleweight I've ever seen.''        

                    After initial success, in which the fighter rose to No. 6, more money was needed and the dozen syndicate members had to decide whether to raise their $1,000 stakes.        

                    ''Some guys wanted to put more money in,'' recalled the organizer, John S. Herrington. ''I said no.''        

                    Since taking over as Secretary of Energy six months ago, Mr. Herrington has made at least two major decisions in which he refused to raise the ante for dubious propositions. One was to alter radically the Government's multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment business, closing facilities in Ohio and Tennessee.        

                    Great Plains Project Rebuffed        

                    Then, late last month, Mr. Herrington announced that the Administration would not further aid the $2 billion Great Plains coal gasification plant, the nation's most ambitious synthetic fuel project. This prompted the five corporate sponsors to default on their construction loan and left his department with ownership of an uneconomic plant that might have to be mothballed after completion.        

                    Some people have therefore begun to call Mr. Herrington a ''white-elephant slayer'' a characterization that seems to bother the 46-year-old Californian not at all.        

                    ''These are dollars-and-cents decisions,'' he insists; ''business decisions. The way I approach this is that when you put money into projects, you are taking it from the people. Do you take $2.5 billion out for the Portsmouth gas centrifuge plant when you know it's unneeded and uncompetitive? Do you pull out another couple of billion for Great Plains? My answer is no.''        

                    For a man who, like three of his four predecessors, has no experience in energy, Mr. Herrington has made quite an impact in his brief tenure, while remaining perhaps the least known Cabinet member.        

                    Besides the uranium enrichment and synfuels decisions, he might have been instrumental this summer in persuading President Reagan not to seek an import fee on oil and refined products, and some think he may be on his way to winning a reversal of Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel's decision to restrict severely the acreage available for oil and gas uses on the outer continental shelf.        

                    He Favors Reagan Decision        

                    Although he maintains Mr. Reagan ''took his own counsel'' in rejecting the import fee proposed by Senate Republicans, Mr. Herrington argues it was clearly the right decision.        

                    In addition to its being a tax, which the Administration has long said it will not accept, an import fee would have ''put us back into the business of deciding winners and losers,'' Mr. Herrington says. The Energy Department, as administrator, would have been pressed for exceptions for such special claimants as in the Northeast, which uses more heating oil than other areas; California, which relies heavily on the automobile, and ailing petrochemical producers.        

                    Earlier this month, Mr. Herrington caused yet another stir when the head of the Economic Regulatory Administration, an Energy Department unit, quit after Mr. Herrington turned down a proposal to expand the prosecution of oil companies over $6 billion in overcharges under price controls, which were lifted early in 1981.        

                    'This Is 1985,' He Says        

                    ''This is 12 years after the initial legislation, mind you,'' he said, ''at a time when I'm trying to end this program.'' Of the regulatory administration's lawyers, he said: ''You can't blame them for being inventive, but this is 1985.''        

                    While Mr. Herrington seeks to play down his disagreement with Mr. Hodel - ''We're good friends'' - he has at his fingertips an article in which Mr. Hodel said a year ago that he found it ''incredible'' that the country would impose a moratorium on offshore leasing.        

                    Mr. Herrington, who sometimes confounds aides with his candor, came to the department from the White House, where he was a Presidential assistant for personnel and a sometime troubleshooter.        

                    After high school in Los Angeles, Mr. Herrington went to Stanford, majoring in economics, and on to earn two law degrees at the University of California in San Francisco.        

                    In practice, he soon expanded into real estate development, ranching and the restoration of historic buildings. His association with Mr. Reagan began in 1966 when, as a prosecutor in Ventura County, he worked as a precinct organizer in the Reagan gubernatorial campaign. Two years later, he became an advance man for the national campaign.        

                    He Seeks to Restore Post        

                    Although some in the Energy Department are complaining about recent resignations and five unfilled senior posts, Mr. Herrington has moved to restore the abolished job of Assistant Secretary for Health, Environment and Safety.        

                    Because the department is the successor to the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission, it has responsibility for many dangerous waste sites dating as far back as World War II. He has given a clean-up program high priority.        

                    ''This department has more environmental problems, I think, than any other department in the Government,'' Mr. Herrington says.        

                    Mr. Herrington has given up boxing and motorcycle riding and limits himself now to tennis, golf and skiing.        

                    He lives in McLean, Va., commuting with his wife, Lois, an assistant attorney general, who works across the Mall. Their two daughters are at college in southern California.        

                    Mr. Herrington, well aware of how vulnerable officials are to charges about the use of perquisites, is careful to ask his driver to drop his wife off first, before taking him to the Forrestal Building. He says, ''I don't want her riding around town in a Government car.''        

                    Of the job, he says: ''There are problems, there are frustrations, but nothing unexpected.'' Management, he adds, ''is what I like best.''
