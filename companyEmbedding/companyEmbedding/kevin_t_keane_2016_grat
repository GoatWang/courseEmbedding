                        5 money tips for the millennial 









                        The mortgage process: A visual aid 









                        3 ways our technology makes your life easier 









                        First-Time Homebuyer's Guide: Part 1 







Kevin interview Q&A



                    How long have you been in the mortgage business and what inspired you to get into it?
                

                    I\'ve been in the business since 1998. I came from the commercial construction industry and saw this as an opportunity to change careers not knowing what to expect. I made the transition and never looked back.
                

                    What advice would you give new or first time home buyers?
                

                    I always tell my clients that the 2nd question they should ask, right after \'how much does the house cost\' is \'how much are the property taxes\'. Taxes in New Jersey can greatly impact your monthly housing payment and give a buyer/borrower a false sense of affordability. By knowing exactly what the taxes are, I can give them a real good sense as to monthly payment. I will also ask first time buyers what their comfort level is with respect to their monthly payment and then back into that payment to give them a sense as to how much house they can afford based on their monthly payment needs.
                

                    What part of the home loan process do customers find most difficult and how do you help them through it?
                

                    providing the right documentation seems to be the biggest issue. I try to overcome this ahead of time by being very specific in all conversations and then letting them know that I\'ll follow up with an email (which I do) that reiterates my instructions with respect to bank statements, paystubs, etc
                

                    What can borrowers do to insure a smooth mortgage underwriting process?
                

                    Providing the right documentation seems to be the biggest issue. I try to overcome this ahead of time by being very specific in all conversations and then letting them know that I\'ll follow up with an email (which I do) that reiterates my instructions with respect to bank statements, paystubs, etc.
                

                    Are you active in any local associations or community groups, and at what level? What goals and/or success have you helped these groups achieve?
                

                    I\'m a volunteer firefighter with one of the busiest all-volunteer fire depts. in the state of New Jersey. We respond to over 1100 calls annually and they range from the routine fire alarm to fully involved structure fires, vehicle fires, and motor vehicle accidents with entrapped occupants and hazmat situations. We train weekly and are as skilled as any paid dept. None of us get paid to do this, we just like the idea of giving back to the community and saving lives.
                

                    Tell us something that makes you unique or something wacky, yet interesting about you?
                

                    I like to take chances on unique experiences just to say \"I did that\". I\'ve gone skydiving from 15,000 feet up, I\'ve swam with Whale Sharks, (they are the size of a school bus.. look \'em up) and I don\'t mind entering a burning building because someone has to... it might as well be me.
