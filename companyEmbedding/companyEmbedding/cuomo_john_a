USANA’s Scientific Experts


 
  
USANA’s world-class scientists review the latest scientific literature and clinical studies on important nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. They also test the potency and purity of every USANA product to ensure complete and balanced formulas. USANA scientists come from varying fields of expertise, and most have published numerous papers in their careers. 












Rob Sinnott, PhD
Chief Scientific Officer
With more than 25 years of experience in biotechnology, nutrition, and global business development, Dr. Rob Sinnott is responsible for ensuring USANA remains at the forefront of unique scientific innovation. As chief scientific officer, he manages all aspects of global research and development, building on and preserving the legacy of Dr. Wentz, to improve health worldwide.





















John Cuomo, Ph.D. 
Executive Director of Product Development and Technology
Dr. John Cuomo’s experience in synthetic organic chemistry, manufacturing, and analytical methods make his contribution to USANA invaluable. He holds over 20 United States and European patents and is the author of numerous scientific papers. "There are several areas that I think set USANA apart from other nutritional companies," Dr. Cuomo says. "The first is USANA's quality assurance in product development and manufacturing. Few companies have the level of quality control that USANA does. We spend a tremendous amount of time and money making sure that product composition exactly matches what's on the label. One of the ways we do that is through our in-house testing of ingredient potency."

			Dr. Cuomo has seen many other companies include product lines solely based on the marketability of the products. "We won't jump on the bandwagon to join the latest health craze simply to make a profit."




















Michael Fuhrman, DC 
Dr. Michael Fuhrman received his doctorate in chiropractic from the Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1995. Dr. Fuhrman has been in the nutraceutical industry as a formulator and educator for the past eight years, with nearly 12 years experience as a chiropractor specializing in nutrition and herbal medicine. He came to work for USANA in 2012 and now holds the title of senior executive director of research and development.
			 
			Dr. Fuhrman oversees product development, the clinical testing program, and the science information services group, while working closely with USANA’s quality assurance, quality control, and marketing teams.
			 




















Brian Dixon, Ph.D.
			Executive Director of Health and Science Education
			Dr. Brian Dixon joined USANA’s department of research and development in January of 2009. As an integral member of USANA’s scientific staff, Dr. Dixon’s main role was to facilitate and manage all human clinical studies conducted at, and funded by, USANA. In November of 2014, Dr. Dixon was asked to head up the newly formed department of health and science education as its executive director, where he continues to lecture internationally on the importance of nutrition for optimal health.
			 
			Dr. Dixon earned his PhD in molecular and cellular biology from Oregon State University, where he focused his research on the underlying biochemical mechanisms of the aging process and the therapeutic potential of R-alpha lipoic acid.
			 




















Mark Brown, Ph.D.
			Director of Product Development
			Dr. Mark Brown has completed extensive research in bioorganic chemistry and holds a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of California and a bachelors degree in chemistry from California State University, Chico. With more than 15 years of chemistry experience, he is a valuable member of USANAs scientific team.
			 




















Jeremy Tian, PhD, MD
			Dr. Jeremy Tian has a PhD in nutrition from Emory University and an MD in clinical medicine from Shanghai Medical University. Before he joined USANA in 2013, Dr. Tian worked for several years as a scientist in basic biomedical research at Stanford University and as a gastrointestinal surgeon in China. He is the author of 16 peer-reviewed research articles and a number of conference publications and editorials.
			 
			Dr. Tian’s work at USANA is mainly to use his biological, nutritional, and clinical expertise for product innovation. He is one of the pioneers that developed the strategy of USANA InCelligence Technology™ and kept the company a scientific leader in the supplement industry.




















Keijun Koh
            Product Development Manager
            Ms. Keijun Koh is a licensed pharmacist, who previously worked at a biochemistry laboratory as well as one of the leading trading companies in Japan, where she oversaw regulatory affairs and product development.

He holds a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering from New Jersey Institute of Technology and has more than 27 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and nutritional industry. As project manager, one of Mr. Eng’s primary functions is to transform research and development ideas into high-quality nutritional products. 
			 




















Rachel A. Brewer, Ph.D.
Dr. Rachel A. Brewer is a laboratory-trained scientist with a background in molecular biology and nutrition. Growing up surrounded by nature in small-town Alaska, she developed an interest in health and nutrition that guided her career. She completed her undergraduate studies in biological sciences, with a focus on molecular biology, at the University of Alaska Anchorage. During that time, she interned at the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover in Hannover, Germany, researching bacterial contributions to inflammatory bowel diseases.
			 
			Doctoral studies took Dr. Brewer to the University of Alabama at Birmingham, home of the world-renowned Nutrition Obesity Research Center, where she investigated diet and nutritional impacts on aging and longevity, with a goal of understanding nutritional interventions to help people live healthier, longer lives. Her prior research also explored the role of the molecular circadian clock, in order to understand how time of day at the cellular level can impact health and disease.
			 
			Dr. Brewer has presented her research at both national and international scientific conferences and has won awards for her scientific endeavors from multiple organizations, including the American Society for Nutrition and the Society for Heart and Vascular Metabolism. Previously, she headed-up the quality control department for a water testing laboratory, ensuring that public water systems remained in compliance with safe water standards.

WYSIWYGGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced Thuro Metal Products, Inc. (TMP), a leading manufacturer of precision metal products for the aerospace, automotive, and industrial equipment industries, is upgrading and modernizing its operations on Long Island in Brentwood, Suffolk County. TMP is acquiring new machinery and equipment, as well as renovating its existing facilities, to ensure the company meets new industry standards and stays competitive with other U.S. and European manufacturers. The project will enable TMP to avoid downsizing and instead expand its operations, which will retain more than 50 jobs and create 15 new jobs on Long Island.  This public-private partnership is another example of how state government is transforming the business climate in New York State, Governor Cuomo said. By upgrading its Brentwood operations, Thuro Metal Products is renewing its status as an economic engine on Long Island and strengthening its competitiveness in the global economy. This upgrade will also create and retain jobs on Long Island, and I look forward to TMPs continued growth in New York State. A home-grown company on Long Island, TMP has manufactured precision machined component metal parts for the aerospace, automotive, and industrial equipment industries, as well as the military, since the early 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s, TMP became a leading supplier of precision hydraulic fittings and component parts used in military aircraft. In 2005, TMP divested itself of direct ownership of NYTEX Automatic Products  a major subsidiary of TMP since 1990  in order to focus on enhancing the two TMP facilities in New York, with the goal of exporting Automotive Hydraulic parts to Europe. We knew that investing in modernizing our operations would enable us to compete in the European market while manufacturing our products in New York. There is a significant advantage in the exchange rate and we are holding ourselves to the European standards of Automotive Production Control, which will put us in a class above those only supplying the domestic market, said David A. Thuro, President, Thuro Metal Products, Inc. After the first production shipments from Thuros New York facilities were made to the Netherlands and Turkey, we developed new programs for this year that would require additional, significant investments to expand our production capacity. The support from the States Excelsior Jobs Program has been the catalyst for our new investments and the jobs we have been creating. To help the project move forward in New York State, Empire State Development is providing $200,000 in Excelsior Jobs Program performance-based tax credits, which are tied to job creation and investment commitments. The company plans to invest more than $3 million in new machinery and equipment, and renovations to its facilities to upgrade its manufacturing operations. TMP has already invested $750,000 into plant renovations and new machinery and equipment, along with hiring 6 new, full-time associates to facilitate these additional multiyear Automotive Hydraulic programs. Empire State Development President, CEO & Commissioner Kenneth Adams said, Under Governor Cuomos leadership, New York is making smart, strategic investments to create jobs and spur economic growth. Thuro Metal Products has a long legacy of manufacturing quality products in New York State, and we are proud to partner with the company to ensure they remain competitive, continue to operate effectively and create jobs for Long Islanders for years to come. The support from ESD was critical to TMP moving forward with the project  without the renovations to comply with new industry standards, the company would have been forced to scale back production and downsize its workforce. As a result, more than 50 employees will be retained and, instead of layoffs, TMP will create 15 new jobs. Senator Lee M. Zeldin said, The expansion of TMP is a step in the right direction for Long Island manufacturing. I thank ESD for their work and welcome the opportunity to not only preserve existing jobs, but to create new ones for Long Islanders." Creating and retaining jobs in Suffolk County is paramount to ensuring the Countys economic stability, said Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone. I thank Governor Cuomo and the Empire State Development Corp for working with Thuro Metal Products to assist them in expanding their operations and retaining employment opportunities here in Suffolk.  John Cochrane, Town of Islip Councilman said, Thuro supports the aerospace industry, a sector that the Town of Islip has recognized as extremely important to our local economy. In addition, firms like Thuro provide precision machining to other Islip-based aerospace companies and because of their continued success; they help other companies in this vital industry thrive. The Excelsior Jobs Program is critical for companies such as Thuro and we're extremely supportive of the financial assistance that Empire State Development is providing.
