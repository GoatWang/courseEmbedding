About MRV







Experience





MRV is a long-standing company with nearly three decades of experience. MRV has passed many cycles of technology and market changes over this period, creating innovative solutions to align with market trends and technology evolution. When other companies disappeared, MRV adapted like a “chameleon” that survived the brutal environment of the market, exploring new technologies to develop market-driven solutions. MRV’s core experience in packet and optical technologies is the cornerstone of network power. Experience matters.





Innovation





MRV was one of the first companies to develop unique networking solutions based on convergence of packet and optical technologies. The company started as an optical components developer, and over the years expanded to subsystems and carrier-grade packet optical solutions. MRV has led the optical communications market with many creative first innovations:
Industry-first Fast and Gigabit Ethernet switches in the mid-nineties, first carrier-grade Ethernet over optical technologies in 1997, and industry first Linux-based router in 1999. In 2007 the company introduced the industry’s first 10G Network Interface Device (NID), and later the first 100G NID.





People





Our employees serve as mentors to our customers, with substantial talent that offers outstanding knowledge and a convincing credible track record. We go the extra mile: We have more “hunger” for rapid changes and delivery of creative solutions that makes us nimble for our customers.






Key Facts







Founded in 1988 and headquartered in Chatsworth, CA, USA







Publicly listed since 1992 – NASDAQ, MRVC







3 R&D centers in USA and Israel







Over 1000 global customers







Over $2B of field-proven installed base of optical transport

About MRV







Experience





MRV is a long-standing company with nearly three decades of experience. MRV has passed many cycles of technology and market changes over this period, creating innovative solutions to align with market trends and technology evolution. When other companies disappeared, MRV adapted like a “chameleon” that survived the brutal environment of the market, exploring new technologies to develop market-driven solutions. MRV’s core experience in packet and optical technologies is the cornerstone of network power. Experience matters.





Innovation





MRV was one of the first companies to develop unique networking solutions based on convergence of packet and optical technologies. The company started as an optical components developer, and over the years expanded to subsystems and carrier-grade packet optical solutions. MRV has led the optical communications market with many creative first innovations:
Industry-first Fast and Gigabit Ethernet switches in the mid-nineties, first carrier-grade Ethernet over optical technologies in 1997, and industry first Linux-based router in 1999. In 2007 the company introduced the industry’s first 10G Network Interface Device (NID), and later the first 100G NID.





People





Our employees serve as mentors to our customers, with substantial talent that offers outstanding knowledge and a convincing credible track record. We go the extra mile: We have more “hunger” for rapid changes and delivery of creative solutions that makes us nimble for our customers.

History[edit]
MRV was founded in 1988 by Prof. Shlomo Margalit and Dr. Zeev Rav-Noy as a maker of Metro and Access optoelectronic components. MRV’s Metro and Access transceivers enable network equipment to be deployed across large campuses or in municipal and regional networks. To expand leadership, MRV established LuminentOIC, an independent subsidiary. LuminentOIC makes fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) components, activity that was initiated by Rob-Goldman that founded the FTTx business unit in Luminant at 2001.
In the 1990s, MRV produced Ethernet switching and Optical Transport for Metro and campus environments. MRV began building switches and routers used by carriers implementing Metro Ethernet networks that provide Ethernet services to enterprise customers and multi-dwelling residential buildings.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
