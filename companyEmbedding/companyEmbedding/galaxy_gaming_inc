	Having Just Become A Public Company, Galaxy Gaming With A High Margin 
	Recurring Revenue Model Has Prospered During The Recession And Is Well 
	Positioned To Explode During The Recovery




About 
	Galaxy Gaming
Headquartered in Las Vegas, 
	Galaxy Gaming (www.galaxygaming.com), is the world�s second largest 
	developer, manufacturer and distributor of casino table games including 
	Lucky Ladies, Texas Shootout and Emperor�s Challenge. In addition, it 
	develops innovative and enhanced electronic wagering platforms such as its 
	Bonus Jackpot System. Galaxy Gaming distributes its products to casinos 
	throughout North America and on cruise ships worldwide.


	Casinos use proprietary table games and bonus jackpot products in lieu of 
	those available in the public domain (e.g. blackjack, craps, roulette, etc.) 
	because of their popularity with players and because the casinos generate 
	significantly more profit.
 

Robert 
	B. Saucier, 
	President and CEO
	Biography

Robert B. Saucier is the founder, 
	Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Galaxy Gaming, Inc. In 
	that capacity, he has led the Company from inception to its current status 
	as a publically traded company. Prior to forming Galaxy Gaming, he was the 
	founder and CEO of the Mars Hotel Corporation, which operated the first 
	non-tribal casino in the State of Washington. House-banked casino gaming 
	became legal in Washington in 1998 as a result of several legislative bills 
	authored by Mr. Saucier. In addition to his gaming experience, Mr. Saucier 
	has been an entrepreneur since 1976 having founded and developed numerous 
	successful companies including International Pacific, Inc., a

	Interview conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFOinterviews.com, 
	Published � October 30, 2009
 

CEOCFO: Mr. 
	Saucier, how was it that you started Galaxy Gaming?
Mr. Saucier: Galaxy Gaming started out 
	as almost an accident. I used to own a small casino and I ended up creating 
	a side bet for blackjack that became very popular with our players and 
	financially, very profitable for our casino. As a result of the success we 
	were having, our competitors sought to have our product added to the 
	blackjack games in their casinos as well. So, it became the a �tail that 
	wags the dog� story. The demand for this product by both players and casinos 
	kept growing and growing, and that was the beginning of Galaxy Gaming. It 
	really was not planned; it was the result of a pleasant accidental surprise.

 

CEOCFO: 
	What is Galaxy Gaming all about today?

Mr. Saucier: 
	We provide table games and electronic enhancements for casinos throughout 
	North America on cruise ships worldwide.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Will you tell us more about the casino table game industry; particularly the 
	growth trends?

Mr. Saucier: 
	 In the 40�s and 50�s casino table games were king. Slot machines had very 
	little impact on the casino industry but were provided mainly to give 
	spouses something to do while the men played table games. Eventually 
	however, slots became more prominent and the percentage of floor space they 
	occupied increased over table games. This trend seemed to be endless, at 
	least in North America anyway, but several events kept table games a very 
	important component of the gaming floor.

 

First, proprietary table games were invented 
	back in about 1988 when a new casino table game called �Caribbean Stud� was 
	introduced. The game featured a progressive jackpot prize that progressively 
	grew with each wager placed. It was like a mini lottery on the table game. 
	For one dollar, a player could potentially win hundreds of thousands of 
	dollars. The game became a hit and casinos all over the world couldn�t wait 
	to have it because of the huge player demand. Caribbean Stud made its owners 
	extremely wealthy and the table game gold rush was on!

 

Second, table games had a resurgence about ten 
	to twelve years ago. We first noticed a change at the Hard Rock Hotel and 
	Casino in Las Vegas. Obviously, the Hard Rock caters to a younger crowd and 
	they prefer the live human interaction of table games, compared to merely 
	depositing their money into a computer.

 

Third, table games received another boost a 
	little over six years ago when the poker craze took off on television. 
	Although that primarily affected live poker rooms, collaterally that trend 
	also benefited casino table games. Sort of a �rising tide lifting all boats� 
	equation.

 

Finally, the expansion of gaming in the Asian 
	markets has drastically increased the popularity of table games. In those 
	markets, such as Macau, slot machines are insignificant compared to the live 
	table game play.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Tell us specifically about your games and other products?, 

Mr. Saucier: 
	We divide the proprietary table games we provide into two classifications. 
	One is what we refer to as a side bet which is an additional bet on a game 
	that is in the public domain, for example, a separate wager made in the game 
	of blackjack. The other type is what we refer to as stand-alone premium 
	games. These are unique games in and of themselves. An example of a game 
	like that is the table game known as Texas Shootout, which is a casino 
	variation of Texas Hold�em.

 

In addition to our proprietary games, we also 
	have electronic enhancements for table games. One such enhancement is our 
	Bonus Jackpot System, where players, while they are playing table games, can 
	participate in an electronic bonusing platform where they can win a very 
	substantial jackpot for maybe as little as a dollar.

 

CEOCFO: Who 
	is doing the inventing?
Mr. Saucier: Since we have an extensive 
	and growing distribution system, we see at least 100 new games a year that 
	come to us from inventors who demonstrate different games that they have 
	invented. Most of those will never see the inside of a casino, but there are 
	many people with many ideas. Mainly however, we develop our own games 
	internally and I lead our game development team.

 

CEOCFO: How 
	do you go from concept to finished product?

Mr. Saucier: 
	If we develop a new game and feel good about it, we brand it and give it a 
	name. We work on the graphics, both in terms of the logo and how it is going 
	to actually play on the table surface. Once we have that and feel good about 
	it, then one of the things that we will do is file a patent application to 
	see if we can protect the concept with a patent. We also have a mathematical 
	analysis done on it. We first do it internally, then go outside and get one 
	or more mathematical analysis done so that we understand what the house 
	advantages of the game are and how the game will play out. Once we have all 
	of that done, we then go to some of our existing casino clients who we know 
	like to experiment with new games. From their feedback and our own 
	observations, we rate the game�s popularity with players and the 
	profitability of the game.

 

CEOCFO: 
	What is your revenue model for these games and products? Are they sold 
	outright or do they compliment your recurring revenue model?

Mr. Saucier: 
	The short answer is both, and I do not mean not �either / or.� Let me 
	explain this. Most of us are familiar with the classic �razor blade� example 
	of giving away the razor so that you can sell the blades. In Galaxy Gaming�s 
	case and with our products and particularly the Bonus Jackpot System, we 
	have an unusual opportunity to sell both the razors and the blades. Casinos 
	purchase the equipment they need from us but then they also pay us monthly 
	fees for its use.

 

For example, with our proprietary games a 
	casino will agree to pay us a fixed amount per month such as $500 per table 
	per month. Plus, when our electronic enhancements are used, the Company 
	receives additional recurring revenue as well in direct proportion to the 
	game�s performance. We refer to this as �performance based pricing,� whereby 
	we get a fee for every wager a player places. So the better our game does, 
	the greater the fee we receive.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Will people go to a particular casino because of the variety?

Mr. Saucier: 
	The answer is yes, people will go to a certain casino because games exist 
	there that do not exist in other casinos. The reason people gamble in the 
	first place is because they have to have a belief that at times they can 
	beat the casinos. Over the long run, people know that they can�t, but from 
	time to time they may be able to. So, if they see a new game and they think 
	they have it figured out how to win at it, then that will attract them to 
	that particular game.

 

CEOCFO: 
	What is your geographic reach?

Mr. Saucier: 
	Roughly, we last counted about 262 casinos who are Galaxy Gaming clients. 
	They are located throughout North America and on cruise ships worldwide. We 
	do plan to expand into Europe, Asia, and throughout the globe in the coming 
	years.

 

CEOCFO: Is 
	it casino by casino, a chain of casinos or line of cruise ships; how does it 
	work?

Mr. Saucier: 
	Both, but generally speaking it is casino by casino. For example, even 
	though we may have national agreements with major gaming corporations such 
	as Harrah�s, each casino makes its own decision as to which games they would 
	like to put in. However, we also have other clients such as cruise ships 
	whereby the cruise ship corporation will make the decision to put the 
	product in on all of their ships.

 

CEOCFO: 
	What has changed for you in the current economy?

Mr. Saucier: 
	The positive effect is that our products are in higher demand now than they 
	were before. Particularly in a down economy, casinos have a need to make 
	more money. Since we don�t require a large capital expenditure and we can 
	immediately improve the bottom line for casinos, they are very attentive to 
	the types of products we offer. It is significant to note that the last time 
	we experienced this level of growth was during the months that followed the 
	tragedies of September 11th.

 

So from that standpoint the recession has been 
	good for us as our recurring revenues have been growing significantly. For 
	example, the revenues we posted in the 1st and 2nd 
	quarters represent a 30% and 34% increase respectively over the same 
	quarters a year ago. We estimate our 3rd Quarter revenues to 
	exceed 40% growth. So, that part of our business has been excellent.

 

The negative effect that the economy has had on 
	us, particularly for a small company like ours, is reduced access to 
	capital. But we are fortunate in that we are cash flowing, so we don�t need 
	capital to sustain our operations. However, to be able to grow or take 
	advantage perhaps of acquisition opportunities we need capital and the 
	access to capital is very difficult right now in today�s financial market 
	place. In spite of this, we have been successful in attracting new capital 
	to our company and a recent offering we completed was over-subscribed. So, 
	it can be done, its just a lot harder in this economy.

 

CEOCFO: 
	What is the competitive landscape; are there many companies coming out with 
	new ideas, or is it a limited field?

Mr. Saucier: 
	Actually, it is quite limited. It used to be greater, but there have been a 
	number of mergers and acquisitions. The industry is dominated by Shuffle 
	Master and they are the largest company in the space. We are the second 
	largest company in the space and then below that there are maybe about ten 
	or twelve small to medium-size companies, with only one other one that is a 
	public company.

 

CEOCFO: 
	What is ahead for Galaxy?
Mr. Saucier: We have some exciting new 
	products that I just can�t wait to come out. I�d love to talk about them, 
	but I�m sure you understand why, for legal and competitive reasons, I can�t 
	yet. But here is one clue. The Bonus Jackpot System that I mention 
	previously is continually evolving, so we are doing new versions of it.

 

The Bonus Jackpot System is really our big 
	story for 2009 and beyond. We just released it in March of this year and we 
	limited its distribution to one trial market, which was Washington State. We 
	did that with the intent to gain an understanding of the product and to 
	experience its reliability and determine field service requirements. Our 
	goal was to get it in the field for about six months and get about 100 units 
	out before we started to go into other jurisdictions. Now that we have 
	accomplished those goals, we are now negotiating with other jurisdictions 
	and plan on spreading our Bonus Jackpot system throughout North America and 
	on cruise ships. Eventually we intend on expanding globally.

 

CEOCFO: You 
	recently became a public company; why was this the time?

Mr. Saucier: 
	I can�t say that we specifically picked this time other than it was a long 
	process that had begun several years earlier. It just so happens that we 
	became public in what is probably the worst recession in history, but from 
	that standpoint our investors are very pleased. If you are going to invest 
	into a company, everybody knows the goal is to buy low and sell high. So 
	from that standpoint, there is probably no better time than now for an 
	investor to invest in a company like ours. Valuations over all are low, but 
	the import thing to consider is to find quality and to separate those 
	companies that you think will do well, versus those that won�t prosper or 
	even survive. As a result, our investors are very pleased since we are doing 
	very well in tough times and will do even better as we all pull out of this 
	recession. That is why I think Galaxy Gaming represents a great opportunity 
	for investors at this time.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Haven�t you recently expanded your sales force?

Mr. Saucier: 
	Yes and we intend on expanding it further in the future. Our primary use of 
	proceeds for any funds that we might raise, and in fact our primary 
	strategies to rapidly grow our company is: to expand our sales force and 
	distribution networks, and escalate our research, development and 
	engineering.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Would you address potential investors; there are so many companies to choose 
	from, why pick Galaxy Gaming out of the crowd?

Mr. Saucier: 
	The first thing that people get excited about with our company is that our 
	revenues are high margin recurring revenues. Typically our recurring 
	revenues are 95% or more of our total revenues and they represent very high 
	margins. That is something that most investors get thrilled about, because 
	there is a lot of stability in a revenue model like that. Second of all is 
	that we have shown phenomenal growth throughout the recession, and really 
	without attracting much in the way of outside capital. So once we get out of 
	the recession our company should do extremely well, because we have proven 
	how well we can do in the tough times. Plus, we now have the ability to 
	raise some capital to fuel our expansion.

 

Also, we have been in business for twelve 
	years, so whatever was going to kill us probably would have done so by now. 
	We are a very stable and solid company with an excellent management team and 
	a great reputation in the industry.

 

CEOCFO: 
	Final thoughts, what should people remember most when they read about Galaxy 
	Gaming?

Mr. 
	Saucier: To our 
	clients; we treat them with the utmost of respect and we have a tremendous 
	reputation among our clients for our fairness and quality of service. To our 
	investors; all of us here are striving to make their decision to invest in 
	Galaxy Gaming the best investment decision they ever made.
