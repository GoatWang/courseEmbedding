Manulife's Lab of Forward Thinking Collaborates with Indico Data Solutions
Aug 26 16
Manulife's Lab of Forward Thinking (LOFT) announced that it is collaborating with Indico Data Solutions. This collaboration is part of a strategic effort to leverage best-in-class products and accelerate business adoption of innovative technologies such as Artifical Intelligence (AI), blockchain and virtual reality. Manulife's LOFT will use indico's platform to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning tool to analyze unstructured financial data. Using Deep Learning, Manulife will be able to analyze data from news articles, analyst reports and other similar sources and present recommendations that could help investment researchers and portfolio managers make more informed decisions faster than ever before. Manulife's LOFT is using indico's Deep Learning platform to decipher natural language and more efficiently train the computer to extract insights that can be tailored to each analyst's individual requirements - one of indico's core strengths. Manulife - and under its John Hancock brand in the United States - has established a global network of LOFTs in Boston, Toronto and Singapore.

indico allows your computer to explore text and image data in a natural way.

                        There's no doubt that analytics have come a long way from gut feelings. That said, today's solutions miss the core of the human experience. People want to investigate trends that live outside of 1's and 0's.
                        Whether you're in a board room or a dorm room, we'll make machine learning the easiest part of your project.

All Feedback provided by Customer is provided “AS IS” and without warranty or representation of any kind.
			



Miscellaneous.


11.1 Compliance with Laws.  Each Party shall comply with all laws, rules, regulations and ordinances applicable to its activities hereunder.
			

11.2 Assignment.  Customer may not assign this Agreement, or assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Indico. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this paragraph is null and void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each Party’s successor and permitted assigns.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indico may assign this Agreement to any acquirer of all or substantially all of its assets as they relate to this Agreement.
			

11.3 Entire Agreement; Amendment.  This Agreement along with the subscription arrangement chosen by the Customer at https://indico.io/plans contains the complete understanding and agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, oral or written, with respect thereto.
			

11.4 Notices.  Indico may give any notices issued in connection with this Agreement by email to Customer at the email address given by Customer when creating its account, and such notices shall be effective upon confirmation of transmission to Customer.
			

11.5 Force Majeure.  Indico shall not be liable or responsible to Customer, nor be considered to have defaulted or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any provision of this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from any act, circumstance or other cause beyond the reasonable control of Indico, including acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot, or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to either Party’s workforce), or restraints or delays affecting carriers or inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable technology or components, telecommunication breakdown, or power outage.
			

11.6 Publicity.  Indico shall have the right to use Customer’s name and logo on client lists published on Indico’s website and in marketing materials.  Indico may announce the relationship hereunder in a press release provided that Indico obtains Customer’s prior approval of the wording of the release (not unreasonably withheld). 
			

11.7 Choice of Law.  This Agreement is and will be governed by and construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws provision thereof or of any other jurisdiction that would produce a contrary result.
			

11.8 Disputes; Arbitration.  Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between Customer and Indico or its employees, agents, successors, or assigns, will exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration. Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “Rules and Procedures”).  For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.

				Customer and Indico agree as follows: (a) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY A PARTY MUST BE BROUGHT IN SUCH PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (b) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (c) in the event that Customer is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Indico will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) Indico also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law; and (h) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.

				Notwithstanding the foregoing (i) either Customer or Indico may bring an individual action in small claims court to the extent eligible, and (ii) either Party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Massachusetts in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Massachusetts for such purposes. A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
			

11.9 Relationship of the Parties.  The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise or employment relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall have authority to contract for or bind the other Party in any manner whatsoever.
			

11.10 Waiver.  No waiver by either Party of any of the provision of this Agreement is effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by such Party.  No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement operates, or may be construed, as a waiver thereof.  No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder precludes any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
			

11.11 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
			

11.12 Headings; Interpretation.  Headings are provided for convenience only and will not be used to interpret the substance of this Agreement.  Unless the intent is expressly otherwise in specific instances, use of the words “include,” “includes,” or “including” in this Agreement shall not be limiting and “or” shall not be exclusive.

Docs -
                Get API Access




Our Language Detection model is built to help you identify multilingual users and multilingual content so you
            can respond appropriately. The API is also helpful as a preprocessing tool for our other apis, so you don't
            accidentally run English Sentiment Analysis on Spanish text, for example.
Benchmark: The API performs with 96% accuracy on 100-character sequences.
        Common Use Cases: identifying multi-lingual users, filtering unstructured text
Languages: Arabic (ar), Bulgarian (bg), Chinese (ch), Czech (cs), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English
            (en), Esparanto (eo), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hungarian
            (hu), Indonesian (id), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latin (la), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian

The Facial Emotion Recognition model analyzes an image of a face and detects alignment to six different
            emotions: Anger, Sadness, Surprise, Fear, Happiness, and Neutral.
For example, Facial Emotion Recognition is used by companies to predict attitudes and actions based on facial
            expressions.
Common Use Cases: advertizing, content creation, attitude prediction, real-time emotion recognition

Content Filtering
Determine if an image is 'Not Safe For Work'.

Docs -
                Get API Access




This model determines whether or not an image contains mature content. Examples of mature content include
            nudity and gore.
For example, if your site accepts customer user-submitted content and you would like to avoid displaying
            pornographic imagery, Content Filtering can allow you to instantly decide whether or not to accept an
            image.
Common Use Cases: content curation in professional or youth-targetted settings, user-submitted content
            management


DEMO
Choose an image to see the Content Filtering API determine whether it is innapropriate or not.

Custom Collections Training API
Train a model with orders of magnitude less data.

Docs -
                Get API Access




The Custom Collections Training API allows you to train a text or image model on top of our rich feature
            embeddings. With just a couple hundred text examples or about 50 image examples, you can train a model that
            would otherwise require hundreds of thousands of examples.
You don't need to worry about hardware or model construction. Simply add your examples, tell the model to
            train, and make predictions.
For example, if you want to train a model to determine whether an article would be popular with your users,
            you give your model 100 examples of articles that your users like and 100 articles that they don't. Building
            a model for this task from scratch would require at least 50,000 examples, but because our Custom
            Collections models are pretrained to already understand the relationships between words, they are able to
            function well with far less training on your end.

“Wow — eContext is like named-entity recognition on steroids! In my research, I’ve worked with long-form text for years, including news, surveys, and conversational data, but I’ve never seen it structured and annotated so effectively before. Your algorithms are incredible.”


John Mohr

Simple Structure for Dark Text
 
Top performing companies understand how to gain knowledge discovery from data through a better text classification system. They use data extraction techniques to consume high-volume streams of dark text including user generated content from a range of sources, pull it into a framework that makes sense for their business, and use the findings to deeply analyze and optimize their offering. 
Maintaining a competitive edge means learning more from your data by using better data harvesting tools that can handle high-volume, high-velocity, or ungainly data.
eContext provides the unstructured data analytics framework that companies use to structure dark text. Find out more about our real-time text analytics and big data classification solutions.




eContext provides the text classification system companies use to bring order to the chaos.




eContext is the Web’s largest text classification system. Our categorization API and classification software solutions provide enhanced big data classification, so you can more accurately analyze your data. eContext stands out among data solutions with our high-coverage, fast and intuitive classification — more than 450,000 categories in all topics, comprising a universal taxonomy with up to 21 tiers of granularity. That’s 1000x more categories and seven times deeper than the IAB, ensuring more accuracy, more control, and more relevance. 


















eContext Categorizes Your Data


















There are a number of ways to augment and structure streams of user generated content: NLP text analytics, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, keyword monitoring, or corpus-based comparisons. eContext takes a more complex approach.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
