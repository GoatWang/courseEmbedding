	SAFE LANES SYSTEMS, INC.


	 




	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	June 30, 2016


	 


	 



	NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

	 


	 


	SAFE LANES SYSTEMS, INC. (the “Company”),
	was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 10, 2013. The Company was formed to engage in the sale of traffic
	safety equipment. The Company may also engage in any other business permitted by law, as designated by the Board of Directors of
	the Company. During the second quarter of 2014 the Company secured a perpetual license to all of the intellectual property of Superior
	Traffic Control in exchange for the issuance of nonvoting convertible stock in the company.


	 


	Basis of Presentation - The accompanying financial
	statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
	and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information and the instructions
	to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the information contained herein
	reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s results of operations, financial position and
	cash flows. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.


	 


	Reclassifications - Certain amounts in the
	prior period’s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current quarter’s presentation and to
	correct prior period errors.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	Cash Flows - During the period ending June
	30, 2016, the Company primarily utilized cash proceeds from an unsecured short term loan to fund its operations.


	 


	Cash flows used by operations for the period
	ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $42,628 and $118,998 respectively.


	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments
	with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents
	of $931 as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $15,282 as of December 31, 2015.



	 




	Impairment of Long-life Assets



	In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company
	reviews its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future
	net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and
	carrying amount of the asset. No impairment was deemed necessary as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 



	Intangible Assets, Patents



	During the second quarter of 2014 fiscal year
	the Company acquired the exclusive license rights and intellectual property for the patent of the Kone General device which expires
	July 2022. As payment for the license rights the company agreed to issue 22,768,273 shares of class B preferred, nonvoting shares
	to the shareholders of the original license holders “Superior Traffic Controls”. The Company accounts for its patent
	sub-license in accordance with ASC 350-30-30 “Intangibles – goodwill and other” and 805-50-30 and 805-50-15 related
	to “Business Combinations” by recognizing the fair value to the amount paid by the company for the asset at the time
	of purchase. Since Safe Lanes Systems has a limited operating history management determined to use par value as the value recognized
	for the transaction. Since the patent has a predetermined, finite life span, the cost of the asset will be recognized on a straight
	line basis over the remaining life of the patent.


	 


	At the conclusion of each reporting period
	the patent is evaluated for impairment. As of June 30, 2016 due to the lack of sales and determining that incomplete engineering
	plans were provided the Company determined it should impair the entire remaining value of the intangible asset.

	Amortization expense for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016
	and 2015 was $149 and $29 respectively.


	 



	Accounts payable and accrued liabilities



	Accounts payable consisted of $24,892 at June
	30, 2016 and $1,080 at December 31, 2015 respectively. Accrued expense consisted of $5,800 at June 30, 2016 and $0 at December
	31, 2015 respectively. Accrued interest consisted of $23,220 at June 30, 2016 and $14,942 at December 31, 2015 respectively.


	 



	Unsecured, short-term notes payable



	The company obtained an unsecured, short-term
	note of $250,000 at 4% from the original holder of the license to the Kone-General patent in the second quarter of 2014. As of
	June 30, 2016 the Company had received funding of $250,000 on the note payable and an additional $165,000 under the same terms
	with a verbal agreement in place and had recognized $23,220 in accrued interest expense.



	 




	Stockholders’ Equity



	At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
	Company was authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share. In addition, 10,000,000 shares
	of Class A preferred super majority voting stock, $.0001 par value and 50,000,000 shares of Class B preferred, $.0001 par value
	nonvoting convertible shares were authorized. All common stock shares have full dividend rights. However, it is not anticipated
	that the Company will be declaring distributions in the foreseeable future.


	 


	Upon formation, the Company sold the founder
	2,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock for $1,000 cash. Also upon formation, the Company paid the founder stock based
	compensation for services rendered of 10,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value class A preferred super majority voting stock. These
	preferred shares have a stated value of par value of $0.0001. The holder of the Class Stock shall have the right to vote on any
	matter with holders of Common Stock and may vote as required on any action, which Colorado law provides may or must be approved
	by vote or consent of the holders of the specific series of voting preferred shares and the holders of common shares. The Record
	Holders of the Class B Preferred Shares shall have that number of votes equal to that number of common shares which is not less
	than 60% of the vote required to approve any action, which Colorado law provides may or must be approved by vote or consent of
	the holders of other series of voting preferred shares and the holders of common shares or the holders of other securities entitled
	to vote, if any


	 


	Upon execution of a patent sublicense agreement
	the Company issued 22,768,273 shares of its class B preferred convertible stock to a trustee on behalf of shareholders of the original
	license agreement. These shares were converted into regular common stock upon the company registering the underlying shares with
	the SEC and distribution to stockholders which occurred in the 2015 fiscal year.


	 


	In the last quarter of 2016 the Company issued
	350,000 shares of stock to two contractors for past work. As the Company has issued no stock for cash the Company valued the compensation
	based upon par value of $.001 per share resulting in a compensation expense of $35 per share in the period the stock was issued.



	 




	Professional and contractor expenses




	Professional
	and contractor expenses are comprised of the following in the six-month period ended June 30, 2016:

	Use of Estimates

	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
	the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Stock Based Compensation



	The Company accounts for share-based payments
	pursuant to ASC 718, “Stock Compensation” and, accordingly, the Company records compensation expense for share-based
	awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock options and restricted stock awards using the Black-Scholes
	option pricing model.


	 


	Stock compensation expense for stock options
	is recognized over the vesting period of the award or expensed immediately under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 when options are given
	for previous service without further recourse. The Company issued stock options to contractors that had been providing services
	to the Company upon their termination of services. Under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 these options were recognized as expense in the
	period issued because they were given as a form of compensation for services already rendered with no recourse.


	 



	The
	following table summarizes


	 

	share-based compensation expense recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses during each period presented:

	In the last quarter of 2016 the Company issued
	350,000 shares of stock to two contractors for past work. As the Company has issued no stock for cash the Company valued the compensation
	based upon par value of $.001 per share resulting in a compensation expense of $35 per share in the period the stock was issued.

	The fair value of each option granted is estimated
	on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions for grants as follows:


	 








	Risk-free interest rate


	0.01%




	Expected life of options


	 4-5 years 




	Annualized volatility


	144.00%




	Dividend Income


	0.00%







	 



	Income Tax



	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under
	Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (“SFAS 109”).  Under SFAS 109 deferred taxes are provided
	on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry-forwards
	and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences
	between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
	allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
	not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on
	the date of enactment.


	 



	Fiscal year



	 


	The Company employs a fiscal year ending December 31.


	 



	Net Income (Loss) per share



	 


	The net income (loss) per share is computed
	by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common outstanding. Warrants, stock options,
	and common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Company’s preferred stock (if any), are not included in the computation
	if the effect would be anti-dilutive and would increase the earnings or decrease loss per share.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company is currently in the Development stage and has very limited
	revenues. Revenue will be recognized on an accrual basis as earned once operations commence.


	 



	Financial Instruments



	 


	The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments,
	including cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the accompanying balance sheet, are stated at fair value.



	 




	Going Concern and Managements’ Plans



	 


	As shown in the accompanying financial statements
	for the period ended June 30, 2016, the Company has a limited operating history.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, however, the above conditions raise substantial doubt
	about the Company’s ability to do so.  The financial statements do not include any adjustment to reflect the possible
	future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result
	should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company has a plan in place to remove this
	threat through the issuance of notes payable and common stocks offerings.  If the Offering raises at least $250,000,
	then the Company’s estimated expenses related to the Offering and the expenses related to initial projected operating costs
	of the Company will be covered. However, the Company will need to generate more than the expenses of the Offering in order to have
	enough capital to execute its business plan.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company has reviewed all recently issued but not yet effective
	accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material
	impact on its financial condition or results of operations.


	 



	Related Party Transactions



	 


	The Company pays its Chief Executive Officer, Paul Dickman through
	Mr. Dickman’s consulting company, Breakwater Finance, LLC. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015,
	management fees were $32,400 and $32,400 respectively.


	 



	Subsequent Events



	 


	The Company evaluates events and transactions after the balance
	sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. As of the date of this filing there were no events that materially impacted
	the company.

	Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations



	 



	General



	 


	The Company was incorporated
	in Colorado in September of 2013.


	 


	The Company had minimal
	operations from inception to December 31, 2015.


	 


	The Company is in the business of marketing
	and selling traffic safety equipment. We have licensed and sub-licensed I.P. for a spring traffic cone dispenser designed to protect
	highway workers, first responders to vehicle collisions and highway incidents, law enforcement personnel, towing operators, private
	and public utility workers, as well as pedestrians and motorists. Our flagship product, The Kone General Automatic Safety Cone
	Deployment System, is the world’s first and only portable safety cone dispensing system. Safe D-Ploy Spring Cones are patented
	MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) compliant highway safety cones. However, due to lack of success in developing
	a market for our current product we have fully impaired the intellectual property and license agreement and are currently seeking
	a new product to take to market.


	 


	We have begun initial minimal operations and
	are currently without revenue. We engaged a marketing consultant to develop a marketing and sales plan for both the spring traffic
	cone and our automatic traffic cone dispenser in 2015. We have engaged and are currently under agreement with a globally recognized
	manufacturer’s representation firm, The Johander Company of Minneapolis, to help guide us into retail markets, build a manufacturer’s
	representative network, and drive retail sales of our Spring Cone and Safe-D-ploy product accessories. Up to this point these efforts
	have not resulted in sustainable sales and the company is currently looking for additional product lines that it can add to its
	product offerings though none have been identified at this time.



	 



	We are in the developmental stage of our business.
	Since our incorporation September 2013, we have been engaged in securing both exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements for
	our key products, designing a marketing plan, and lining up suppliers and manufacturers for production.


	 



	During
	the 2016 fiscal

	 

	year, we intend to focus our efforts on raising
	additional operating capital and finding additional business areas we can expand into.



	 



	Results of Operations



	 


	There were no revenues
	in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and one sale resulting in revenue of $1,725 in the calendar period of 2015.


	 


	Expenses decreased from
	$59,246 in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 to $42,932 in the six-month period ending June 30, 2016. This decrease was
	primarily caused by the Company reducing professional fee expense categories.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	During the six-months ended
	June 30, 2016 the Company received $20,000 from the issuance of notes payable as compared to no funding during the six-months ended
	June 30, 2015.


	 


	During the twelve -months
	ending June 30, 2017 the Company estimates it will need approximately $250,000 to implement its business plan. Other than the foregoing,
	the Company does not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably expected to have, a material
	impact on sales, revenues or income from continuing operations, or liquidity and capital resources.



	  





	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.



	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 


	An evaluation was carried
	out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
	Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
	on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required
	to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and
	that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
	Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
	Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.


	 




	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	 


	There were no changes in
	our internal control over financial reporting during the six-months ended June 30, 2016 that materially affected or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
