 Educational Background



 


Colorado School of Mines

                  Colorado School of Mines is a public research university devoted to engineering and applied science. It has the highest admissions standards of any public university in Colorado and among the highest of any public university in the U.S.

Mines has distinguished itself by developing a curriculum and research program geared towards responsible stewardship of the earth and its resources. In addition to strong education and research programs in traditional fields of science and engineering, Mines is one of a very few institutions in the world having broad expertise in resource exploration, extraction, production and utilization. As such, Mines occupies a unique position among the world's institutions of higher education.

Since its founding in 1874, the translation of the school's mission into educational programs has been influenced by the needs of society. Those needs are now focused more clearly than ever before. The world faces a crisis in balancing resource availability with environmental protection and Mines and its programs are central to the solution.

Mines offers all the advantages of a world-class research institution with a size that allows for personal attention.                




 


The University of Colorado

                  The University of Colorado advances the economy, health and culture of Colorado and beyond, educating more than 435,000 students who have become catalysts in business, arts, health and community growth. CU’s four campuses feature top-tier faculty and hands-on learning opportunities in an environment where students thrive.

WHY TOSS THE TUBE FOR GOOD?
                                

Enough TP tubes are used each year to fill the Empire State Building, twice. With Scott® Tube-Free Toilet Paper, you can get premium softness without the wasteful tube.
