TEXT MESSAGE REMINDERS & ALERTS
When you ask us to invite a contact to join WedPics, we will send your contact a message on your behalf, using your name, by e-mail message or (if you have selected this option) by text message (“text Alerts”).  We may also send up to two automatic reminders to your contacts in your name and on your behalf by e-mail and/or text Alert.  You can see who has accepted your invitations, send reminders, and delete your contacts’ e-mail addresses and/or phone numbers on your invite history page.  We may also send text Alerts to you at your direction, as described when you sign up for this service.
By entering your mobile phone number(s) or the mobile phone numbers(s) of your selected contacts and successfully activating text Alerts, (i) you acknowledge and represent to WedPics that you are the authorized user of the mobile phone(s) that you link to the text Alert service or have been granted permission by the authorized user of the mobile phone(s) to enroll such mobile phone(s) in the service; (ii) you grant WedPics express permission to send text messages to that (those) mobile phone(s) through your wireless phone carrier unless and until such permission is revoked in accordance with these terms and conditions; and (iii) by granting such permission to WedPics you are hereby requesting to receive (or to have your selected contacts receive) such messages in spite of the fact that your number (or your contacts’ numbers) may otherwise be on the federal, or a state's, do not call list and you agree, to the maximum extent permitted by law, that such text messages shall not be in violation of such do not call list(s).
Eligibility: Text Alerts are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age and older and who are United States residents.  By activating text Alerts, you represent and warrant to us that you (and all of your intended recipients) meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements.  If you (or any of the intended recipients) do not meet all of these requirements, you must not activate text Alerts for such persons.
Activate text Alerts: By entering your mobile phone number at account creation, you are authorizing WedPics to send you text message reminders and alerts.  By asking us to send your contact a message on your behalf via text Alert, you are authorizing WedPics to send such contacts text message invitations and up to two automatic reminder invitations.

Pricing: Standard message and data rates may apply. WedPics does not charge a fee for text Alerts. Check with your wireless phone carrier for your plan details.
Message frequency: The number of text Alerts varies per user, depending on the type of alerts you choose to have sent to your mobile phone or to the mobile phones of your contacts as well as the manner in which you conduct activities on your account.  A WedPics user who opts-in to receive text message reminders and alerts will typically only receive 1-2 messages.
Changes in terms: WedPics reserves the right to change these terms or cancel the text Alerts at any time. Please check these Terms and Conditions on a regular basis for changes.

Limitation of Liability: YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT WEDPICS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EVEN IF WEDPICS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE OR LOSS, ARISING OR RESULTING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO YOUR USE OF TEXT ALERTS. THE WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR DELAYED OR UNDELIVERED MESSAGES. FURTHERMORE, WEDPICS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DELAYS IN THE TRANSMISSION OF MESSAGES DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF WEDPICS'S CONTROL. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.  IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.


PRINT PARTNERS
All photographic print orders that users submit through the Website are received and processed through a third party printing company.  Currently, our print partner is Pwinty Limited (additional information at https://www.pwinty.com/).  When a user places a print order through the Website, Pwinty receives the image URL of any photo that was selected by the user to be printed and delivered to shipping address specified by the user.  All such print orders are custom made to the user’s specifications and have no market beyond such user’s purchase thereof; as such, all such print orders are non-refundable and payment for all such print orders is required to be made in full in advance.  All print orders purchased through Pwinty and shipped to users are subject to a shipment contract under which the risk of loss and title for such items pass to the user upon delivery at the user’s specified delivery location.  By submitting a print order, the user represents and warrants that he or she owns or possesses all necessary rights to the applicable photograph’s content and images, and that he or she has obtained the necessary authorizations and/or permissions to use the content and images therein (including from the persons appearing in the applicable photograph). WedPics shall bear no responsibility or liability for any user failure to comply with the foregoing sentence.  Each user acknowledges and agrees that (A) neither WedPics nor any of its affiliates are the print providers for the photographic prints specified in a user’s print order, and that (B) WedPics therefore cannot and does not control, and is not responsible for, and makes no representations or warranties regarding (i) the quality or suitability of any photographic prints, (ii) whether any print delivered by Pwinty will meet a particular user’s requirements, or (iii) the timeliness of delivery of any such prints.  Users’ exclusive remedies for any damaged or defective photographic prints are to rely on any product warranties given with respect to such photographic prints by the applicable print provider.


FORCE MAJEURE
Company shall not be liable for any losses arising out of the delay or interruption of its performance of obligations due to any acts of God, acts of civil or military authorities, civil disturbances, wars, strikes or other labor disputes, fires, transportation contingencies, interruptions in telecommunications, utility, Internet services or network provider services, acts or omissions by a third party, infiltration or disruption of the Services by a third party, or other catastrophes or occurrences that are beyond WedPics’ reasonable control.


MISCELLANEOUS
