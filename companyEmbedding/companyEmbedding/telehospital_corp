Top Ten Companies in Telemedicine Technologies



Published: January 14, 2013
Content info: 57 Pages














Description

This report provides:

Identification of the top 10 companies in telemedicine technologies and
 the rationale behind these selections.
 Factors that include technical innovation, market leadership, and
 commitment to this market via investment in products.
 When selecting these top 10 companies,  BCC Research looked across the
 industry spectrum and selected the most active and significant contributors
 while recognizing that there are many other contenders. Some of these
 “significant others” are  included but to a less detailed extent
 than the top 10 companies.

INTRODUCTION

 Today, healthcare is one of the top economic and social problems across the
 globe. Put simply, the problem comes down to two factors: accessibility and
 affordability. Here in America, it is reported that U.S. citizens spend twice
 as much as citizens of other developed countries. However, citizens in the
 U.S. also report lower quality, efficiency and access of service than citizens
 in those same developed countries.


 Globally, there is an increasing aging population plagued with chronic
 disease. These factors, combined with a focus on prevention and advancements
 in technologies, pharmaceuticals and treatments, will undoubtedly cause demand
 for healthcare services to continue to increase into the future.

REASONS FOR THE STUDY

 There has been a global focus on the use of telemedicine as a tool to cut down
 healthcare costs and bring about mammoth savings. Implementation of the new
 U.S. healthcare law will, if anything, intensify this focus by increasing the
 number of people who have health insurance and are seeking medical services. 
 In the near to mid-term, telemedicine technologies offer one of the few ways
 of enabling healthcare personnel to meet the increased demand without
 unacceptable delays or other forms of de facto rationing.


 There is interest in studying the ways in which collaborative healthcare can
 be better and more economically implemented through telemedicine. Recently
 announced best practices to cut down global healthcare costs, including
 outsourced medical services, home-based treatment, intervention as opposed to
 post treatment, integrated information technology (IT) environments, increased
 efficiency of healthcare resources and reducing billing gaps, all point toward
 the increasing use of telemedicine.


 Given these factors, it seems timely that BCC identify the top 10 companies in
 the telemedicine field and the key factors to success in the telemedicine
 market that these companies are exploiting.


 The report will also help gauge the ways in which this market can
 significantly affect larger markets such as healthcare, health insurance, home
 care, telecommunications (telecom), networking, disease management, e-health
 and healthcare IT. This is also timely, as major tier-one stakeholders are
 starting to enter the telemedicine market.

STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

 This document is a specialty report related to the BCC Research report HLC014E
 authored by Andrew McWilliams. The goal of this document is to provide a more
 in-depth look at the top-tier telemedicine companies as well as some of the
 second-tier companies to look for in the near future.

Key criteria used to determine top players in the field include:

Financial standing.
 Established market presence.
 Positioning within the healthcare ecosystem.
 Company track record of deliverable solutions.
 End-to-end coverage vs. niche market solution.
 Parent and subsidiary company support.
 Intellectual property and strategic licensing portfolio.


 In addition to this these factors that BCC has chosen to examine, BCC has
 selected these 10 companies for this report that it feels are deserving of
 recognition, and are leaders in their industry.

This list includes:

Alcatel-Lucent.
 AMD Telemedicine Inc.
 Cardiocom.
 Cisco.
 Honeywell Hommed.
 International Business Machines Corp.
 LifeWatch AG.
 Polycom.
 Robert Bosch Healthcare.
 SHL Telemedicine Ltd.


 As any top-10 list is invariably subjective, there are also several companies
 profiled in less detail. These companies were on the bubble or should be
 watched in the near future, as they are currently on the rise.

SCOPE

 The scope of this report is focused on a select 10 companies in telemedicine
 and the key areas in the field that are driving industry growth and allowing
 these companies to succeed. These areas include home health care services,
 monitoring services, medical devices and communications solutions.

NEW YORK, Nov. 7, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Reportlinker.com announces that a new market research report is available in its catalogue:
Global Markets for Telemedicine Technologies http://www.reportlinker.com/p0801566/Global-Markets-for-Telemedicine-Technologies.html#utm_source=prnewswire&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=e-Healthcare
STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVESThis is an update of an earlier BCC report, published in March 2012. BCC's goal in updating the report is to assess the impact of recent technical, economic, legal/regulatory, business and other developments on the global market for telemedicine technologies and services. Objectives of both the original and the updated studies include:• Defining new avenues in the telemedicine market, mainly in terms of cutting-edge technology development, value-added services and newer applications.
• Providing an in-depth understanding of the economics of telemedicine in terms of business models, a cost-benefit analysis and information for an investment business case.• Identifying opportunities for all the stakeholders in telemedicine.• Making a comprehensive market forecast (2013 to 2018) of telemedicine and all its key subsegments.• BCC's key objective is to present a comprehensive analysis of the current telemedicine market and its future direction.
REASONS FOR THE STUDYCompanies require clarity regarding the main markets for telemedicine technologies and services. BCC is interested in providing a comprehensive market forecast for multiple market segments (e.g., technologies, services, applications, geographical).There has been a global focus on the use of telemedicine as a tool to cut down healthcare costs and bring about mammoth savings. Implementation of the new U.S. healthcare law will, if anything, intensify this focus by increasing the number of people with health insurance and seeking medical services. In the near to midterm, telemedicine technologies offer one of the few ways of enabling healthcare personnel to meet the increased demand without unacceptable delays or other forms of de facto rationing.
BCC is interested in studying the ways in which collaborative healthcare can be better and more economically implemented through telemedicine. Recently announced best practices to cut down global healthcare costs, including outsourced medical services, home-based treatment, intervention as opposed to posttreatment, integrated information technology (IT) environments, increased efficiency of healthcare resources and reducing billing gaps, all point toward the increasing use of telemedicine.
BCC aims to identify the key success factors in the telemedicine market and to gauge the ways in which this market can significantly affect larger markets such as healthcare, health insurance, home care, telecommunications (telecom), networking, disease management, e-health and healthcare IT. The report is well timed, as major Tier I stakeholders are entering the telemedicine market.
INTENDED AUDIENCEThis report is intended for telemedicine hardware manufacturers, software providers, telecom and networking companies, the healthcare industry, and healthcare insurance companies. Key takeaways include the identification and quantification of markets for technology and services in the telemedicine market.

NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Reportlinker.com announces that a new market research report is available in its catalogue:
Top Ten Companies in Telemedicine Technologies
http://www.reportlinker.com/p01089680/Top-Ten-Companies-in-Telemedicine-Technologies.html#utm_source=prnewswire&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=e-Healthcare
REPORT SCOPE
INTRODUCTION 
Today, healthcare is one of the top economic and social problems across the globe. Put simply, the problem comes down to two factors: accessibility and affordability. Here in America, it is reported that U.S. citizens spend twice as much as citizens of other developed countries. However, citizens in the U.S. also report lower quality, efficiency and access of service than citizens in those same developed countries.

Globally, there is an increasing aging population plagued with chronic disease. These factors, combined with a focus on prevention and advancements in technologies, pharmaceuticals and treatments, will undoubtedly cause demand for healthcare services to continue to increase into the future.
REASONS FOR THE STUDY 
There has been a global focus on the use of telemedicine as a tool to cut down healthcare costs and bring about mammoth savings. Implementation of the new U.S. healthcare law will, if anything, intensify this focus by increasing the number of people who have health insurance and are seeking medical services. In the near to mid-term, telemedicine technologies offer one of the few ways of enabling healthcare personnel to meet the increased demand without unacceptable delays or other forms of de facto rationing.

There is interest in studying the ways in which collaborative healthcare can be better and more economically implemented through telemedicine. Recently announced best practices to cut down global healthcare costs, including outsourced medical services, home-based treatment, intervention as opposed to post treatment, integrated information technology (IT) environments, increased efficiency of healthcare resources and reducing billing gaps, all point toward the increasing use of telemedicine.
Given these factors, it seems timely that BCC identify the top 10 companies in the telemedicine field and the key factors to success in the telemedicine market that these companies are exploiting.
The report will also help gauge the ways in which this market can significantly affect larger markets such as healthcare, health insurance, home care, telecommunications (telecom), networking, disease management, e-health and healthcare IT. This is also timely, as major tier-one stakeholders are starting to enter the telemedicine market.
STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
This document is a specialty report related to the BCC Research report HLC014E authored by Andrew McWilliams. The goal of this document is to provide a more in-depth look at the top-tier telemedicine companies as well as some of the second-tier companies to look for in the near future.

History of TeleHealth
For more than 50 years, we have been the best value for designing, building, and maintaining patient entertainment, education, and engagement solutions for hospitals. TeleHealth, the largest division of Telerent Leasing Corporation (TLC), has become the acknowledged leader in the industry through our relentless attention to customer satisfaction as well as acquisition of excellent product innovation and superior service.
In the 1960s, TLC began installing and financing hotel and hospital television systems throughout the US and had emerged as one of the leading companies serving the hospitality and healthcare industries by the late 1970s. In 1984, TLC created the TeleHealth Services division to focus exclusively on healthcare television systems. TeleHealth Services’ product line included one of the first computer-based interactive systems, the TeleComputer.
TLC was acquired by ITOCHU International, Inc., in 1989, and has been an important part of ITOCHU’s worldwide operations for 20 years (www.itochu.com). ITOCHU is a Fortune Global 500 corporation with US headquarters at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, New York. ITOCHU awarded TLC one of four worldwide Management Awards in 1993, named TLC as the 1997 recipient of the prestigious Management of the Year Award, and selected TLC for yet another Management Award in 2014.
TeleHealth Services acquired the US and Canadian healthcare television business of Granada North America in 1996. The merger made TeleHealth the largest provider of hospital television systems in America, a position it continues to hold today.
Since its inception, TeleHealth has been an innovator in custom-engineering televisions and other technologies to meet the ever-changing needs of hospitals. TeleHealth partnered with DIRECTV in 1997 to expand hospital channel line-ups and reduce costs. That same year, TeleHealth became the exclusive US distributor of the Philips healthcare televisions.
In 1998, TeleHealth launched its proprietary Tigr system, tapping into emerging digital technologies and allowing hospitals to offer powerful educational video-on-demand services to patients. The Tigr client base makes up the largest network of healthcare video-on-demand systems in the US. TeleHealth continues to pioneer new technology and hospital-driven software innovations through our in-house development group.
TeleHealth created its TigrNet interactive system in 2004, bringing the expanded content of the Internet directly to the patient rooms. In 2005, TeleHealth marketed the first healthcare-listed high-definition LCD TV and was the first company to deploy off-air high-definition channels in patient rooms.
In 2006, TeleHealth acquired Hospital Communication Systems, and in 2008 TeleHealth Services acquired Instant HealthLine, the second-largest hospital educational television company in the US. In 2010, TeleHealth Services partnered with Samsung Electronics America, Inc. to design and market Samsung’s ground-breaking healthcare TVs to hospitals.
In 2012, TeleHealth Services launched and installed its iTigr interactive system. The iTigr system expands upon Tigr’s “pull” system, meaning information is “pulled” by the user, to being a “push” system, meaning that information can be “pushed” specifically to a patient. The iTigr system provides advanced care plan management tools with workflow and integration capabilities for hospitals. TeleHealth’s full suite of patient systems, the scalability of the Tigr AP and iTigr platforms, and its long-standing leadership position in the industry allows TeleHealth to assure hospitals the best value and operability in system and secure effectiveness and efficiency.
To further expand its solutions offering in 2012, TeleHealth Services acquired Avidex Technologies, an audio visual design and implementation company based in Bellevue, Washington. Avidex’s extraordinary client base includes Adobe, Cisco Systems, Sprint, McAffee, McKesson, Stanford University School of Medicine, and Google. Together, TeleHealth Services and Avidex incorporate a broad range of technologies that empower clients to effectively communicate their message both internally and externally.
The core mission of TeleHealth Services is excellence in the patient experience. Our solutions combine state-of-the-art hardware and software to deliver high-quality educational and entertainment programming and provide patient-specific interactive education. Our innovative solutions, resolute corporate leadership team, hundreds of dedicated employees, and most of all, our distinguished customers, have enabled TeleHealth to become the largest and most successful provider of healthcare television and interactive education systems in the United States.

Corporate Leadership














For more than 50 years, TeleHealth Services has been a leader and innovator in the healthcare industry. Our senior leadership team, with a combined 150 years of healthcare experience, has grown TeleHealth Services into one of the nation’s most respected and successful full solutions providers in the healthcare sector. 
TeleHealth’s leadership understands the importance of a positive work environment and works side-by-side with employees every day, providing guidance, thought leadership, and support.
Joel Harris
CEO, TLC
Joel Harris, CEO of Telerent Leasing Corporation, assumed his current position in April 2015 following an outstanding career in TLC and other multinational public companies. Mr. Harris’s highly-effective collaborative leadership style is well-known among TeleHealth Services and Avidex customers, employees, and business partners. With a proven record in product development and in the acquisition and integration of privately-held companies, he is passionate about expanding TLC’s technology and service platforms to meet customers’ increasingly complex business requirements.
From 2012 until 2015, Mr. Harris served as CEO of Avidex Industries in Bellevue, Washington. At the time of its acquisition by TLC, Avidex was a privately-held company recognized for its excellence in the design and implementation of audio-visual systems for corporate headquarters and customer-facing communications centers. By maintaining and growing Avidex’s employee base and productivity, and supporting the sales force in winning major new clients, Mr. Harris led the Avidex team to achieve record financial and sales results in 2014.
Mr. Harris has deep experience with TLC’s leading Tigr Interactive Patient Systems products and  services, heading that division through its TigrVue and TigrNet growth phases and building the implementation and service platforms currently used to assure rapid and successful deployment of systems tailored to individual hospital interactive requirements.
