MRC Global provides a broad range of valves that are available in a wide variety of materials from today’s leading valve manufacturers to fully meet even the most complex and unique requirements.



Valve Products 
Valve Suppliers 



Ball Valves:

Cryogenic 
Ball valves open and close with a quarter-turn function, using a handle or gearbox and are commonly used in the exploration, production, gas utility, chemical and industrial sectors. MRC Global is one of the largest suppliers of API 6D ball valves to the transmission, pipeline gas gathering, tank farm storage, and utility sectors. MRC Global also stocks extensive size ranges, multiple configurations and most body and trim types of floating and trunnion ball valves. Both Floating ball valves and trunnion ball valves are offered in full and reduced bore sizes.

Threaded & SW

Metal Seated 
Plastic Lined 
Resilient Seated 
Trunnion 
Top Entry 
“V” Port 

Butterfly Valves:

High Performance 
Butterfly valves typically have a circular shaped disc that rotates to open or close the valve, thus controlling the flow of material through the valve, with a quarter-turn function, using a handle or gearbox. MRC Global maintains an extensive inventory of resilient seated butterfly valves, high performance butterfly valves, and triple offset butterfly valves to service all major industrial sectors. Our inventory includes butterfly valves in carbon steel, stainless steel and alloy materials. 
Plastic Lined 
Resilient Seated 
Triple Offset 



Plug Valves:

Lubricated 
MRC Global is a leading distributor of plug valves to the energy and industrial markets. Plug valves are named for the cone-shaped, plug-like device that controls the flow of fluid through the valve. Rotating the handle a quarter turn or turning the handwheel on the gearbox starts or stops the flow of fluid by introducing the through bore or solid portion of the plug. The plug valve is ideal for gas transmission, gas utility and chemical applications, and is offered and stocked in elastomeric lined or full metal construction. 
Non-lubricated 
HF Acid 
Plastic Lined 

Check Valves:

API6A / API6D 
A check valve design only allows fluid to flow one direction. It is generally used in conjunction with other types of valves and will close automatically when line pressure is lost, thus it has no handle to turn on and off. This feature makes check valves ideal for preventing plant and equipment damage caused by excess backflow, a necessity across all streams of the energy industry. Check valves are stocked in several body configurations and materials. 
Lift Check 
Piston Check 
Swing Check 
Wafer Check 
Y Pattern Check 

Multi-Turn Valves:

Gate 
Multi-Turn valves are opened and closed by turning a wheel more than 360 degrees. Two primary examples of this type of valve are the gate valve and globe valve. To open and close the gate valve, multiple turns of the handle are required to turn an acme threaded nut on the threaded shaft of the valve causing it to open or close by raising or lowering the gate. These valves operate in one of two positions, open or closed, and are not recommended for throttling. The globe valve, on the other hand, opens and closes incrementally and is used to modulate flow levels, pressures, or temperatures. Both the gate valve and globe valve are commonly used in downstream applications. MRC Global maintains large inventories of gate valves and globe valves in materials such as carbon steel, stainless steel and special alloys to serve the needs of the refining, petrochemical, chemical and process industries. 
Globe 



Specialty Valves:

Bellow seal 
MRC Global offers a wide variety of specialty valves capable of handling the most severe services: cryogenic, superheated steam, volatile and corrosive fluids, erosion, high pressure drops, vibration, cavitation, flashing and other abrasive services. Diaphragm valves, needle valves, knife gate valves, pinch valves, cryogenic valves and many others are available in carbon steel, stainless steel and specialty alloys. Need additional information about MRC Global’s specialty valve offering? Please use the contact us form and one of our technically trained employees will be in touch as soon as possible.

Subsea Valves:

Ball 
The subsea environment is one of the toughest that a valve can face. Subsea valves must be completely reliable while often exposed to corrosive and hazardous fluids and high pressures. MRC Global provides a wide range of subsea valves specifically designed to meet these challenges. MRC Global stocks an extensive and broad inventory of subsea ball valves, gate valves, choke valves and check valves manufactured by the world’s top manufacturers.

MRC Global Inc. has announced that its Norwegian subsidiary, MRC Global Norway AS, will provide specialty and high alloy valves, manifolds, fittings, tubing, enclosures, tube clamps and other special items for Statoil’s Johan Castberg project. The Johan Castberg project is located in the Barents Sea; Statoil is expected to make an investment decision in 2017.
MRC Global was also named the provider of instrument tubing, fittings, valves and manifold products to Deutsche Erdoel AG (DEA)’s Dvalin project in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The project is expected to be completed and begin production in 2020.
In addition, MRC Global (Sweden) AB signed an agreement to serve as the primary provider of gate, globe and check valves with Statoil’s subsidiary in Denmark: Statoil Refining Denmark A/S. This four-year agreement further expands the longstanding relationship between the two companies into a new geography.
“These agreements are the result of many years of serving our customers as an extension of their supply chain with our product expertise and international sourcing strategy,” MRC Global President & CEO, Andrew R. Lane says. “We look forward to continuing to grow with them and support both Statoil and DEA the coming years.”

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
