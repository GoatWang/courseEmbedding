Leading edge technology combining advanced optimization,intuitive design and massive scale

As a purpose-built open platform, Marin Search enables you to assemble audience, revenue, and contextual data from any source, providing you with immediate performance insights across all your publishers and devices.

Reach ValuableAudiences












Save Time
Our intuitive platform automates and scales your cross-publisher campaigns, all from one place





Quickly manage and scale multiple publishers
With Marin’s Smart Sync, easily clone and sync campaigns from Google to other publishers - and quickly and effortlessly grow your campaigns across Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Baidu. You get the benefit of extending your audience reach by advertising across various publishers, without the burden of creating and managing individual campaigns for each one.



Easily engage audiences by device, location, and time of day
Marin Search offers a streamlined workflow that lets you quickly view and sync your call and sitelink ad extensions, set mobile bid adjustments, adjust day parting strategies, and generate mobile-optimized ad creative. With Marin, you can successfully target, engage, and acquire customers wherever and whenever, regardless of device type.



Efficiently manage shopping ads across publishers
Shopping ads deliver a richer and more engaging search experience through relevant ads that include product details, images, and pricing. Marin lets you create and manage your product ads across Google and Bing, along with the rest of your paid search campaigns. 




Create customized URLs at scale
Marin's URL Builder automatically adds custom parameters into URLs from any source. With full support for Google Upgraded URLs, create and manage your tracking template with ease. 












Improve Performance
Lift campaign performance on your terms using Marin’s flexible, predictive bid, budget, and creative optimization capabilities, powered by an intelligent, fully transparent algorithm





Maximize every dollar invested with budget planning and predictive intelligence
Marin’s Budget Optimizer provides you with the ability to track your monthly budget and optimize it towards desired performance KPIs. Budget Optimizer’s fully transparent algorithm factors in historical day of week, month, and year spend trends. Its interactive What-if analysis tool shows predicted clicks, conversions, and revenue results at different spend targets, and lets you apply recommendations with a single click.



Optimize for the long tail with progressive look-back modeling
Powered by Bayesian Estimation, Marin's patented approach to bidding employs artificial intelligence to automatically calculate optimal bids for low-volume keywords. By sharing data across match types and related keywords, new and long-tail keywords drive immediate revenue outcomes across devices, without an expensive learning or "burn-in" period. 



Secure your visibility with intraday position-based bidding
Marin Search uses patent-pending, machine learning technology to automatically adjust keyword bids in near real-time, as fluctuations are detected, to help preserve your target keyword positions. Hourly calculations factor in historical performance and auction conditions - providing you with additional control over revenue outcomes and ad visibility.




Leverage contextual data to build better bidding rules
Dynamic Actions from Marin allows you to harness the power of 1st and 3rd party data feeds to improve relevancy and accuracy of bidding decisions. By layering rules on top of Marin’s intelligent bidding algorithm, you can capitalize on meaningful trends, such as weather or stock price changes, and build flexible rules that adjust bids accordingly.











“Using Marin to manage our new complex campaign structure in Bing quickly provided us with 10.5% more conversions at 10.4% lower cost. With all data from various publishers coming together in one platform, we are able to create powerful reports and find valuable opportunities while adhering to our budget.”
– Mike Smith / Interactive Marketing Manager / Extra Space Storage

Manage by exception
With Marin’s advanced filtering and alerting functionality, quickly isolate and take action on underperforming keywords and creative. Stay up to date on the health of your accounts - schedule  reports you can export as PDF; or, download data into Web Query reports to easily transform performance data into insightful Excel dashboards.



Understand the impact of paid search across the purchase funnel
In today’s cross-channel world, it’s essential for marketers to understand how other channels impact search. Marin provides keyword click-path analysis and cross-channel reporting, allowing you to understand consumer engagement and how various channels combine to drive paid search conversions.

Increase control over budgets with Marin’s spend forecasting tool














Reach Valuable Audiences
Connect with your audiences with the right message, when it matters most





Simplify cross-channel audience retargeting
The Marin Smart Tag™ lets you define an audience list once; then, it selectively co-fires tracking pixels to synchronously create common audience lists for retargeting in Google RLSA, among other channels. With Marin, you’ll always know you’re delivering relevant ad experiences to each of your defined audience segments.



Track, report, and manage by custom segments
With Marin Search, you can “tag" any campaign element with Dimensions to analyze performance. Define Dimensions for any criteria you want, whether it’s business goals, region, product category, or any other custom business segment - and gain important insights into what matters to your business.



Run Your Channels Independently or in Concert
Marin Software is the only digital marketing platform that allows for cross-channel retargeting to reach the same people across Search, Social, and Display. Using Marin’s unique cross-channel targeting and attribution features, you can engage with audiences on one channel based on their activities on other channels and assign proper credit - resulting in better budgeting and bidding decisions.

History[edit]
Marin Software was founded in April, 2006 by Christopher Lien, Wister Walcott, and Joseph Chang. Lien and Walcott are still with the company, with Lien as the Chief Executive Officer and Walcott as Executive Vice President, Product and Technology.
Lien came up with the concept for Marin Software following a brief stint working for an online ad firm in 2005. He realized that search advertisers had no viable software for managing their online campaigns, especially larger advertisers. Lien shared his idea with Chang and a former high school classmate, Wister Walcott. Chang had built J.Crew's website and was a co-worker with Lien at Bluelight.com, Kmart's ecommerce site, when it launched in 1999. Walcott, who came from software giant Siebel, required a bit more convincing. Alongside Lien, the duo drove up and down California's highway 101 in early 2006, interviewing search marketers in Silicon Valley about their experience managing online ads. After a half-dozen interviews, Walcott was convinced that new software was needed.[1]
In April 2007, Marin Search Marketer made its debut and became commercially available in North America, signing Razorfish, Trouvé Media and ZipRealty. Marin Search Marketer has since been renamed Marin Enterprise Edition and is intended for easy and efficient management of large-scale online advertising programs. In March 2011, Marin Software announced the release of Marin Professional Edition, a paid search management application designed for advertisers and agencies spending less than $100,000 per month on paid search.[2]
Marin Software expanded into the European market with the opening of its UK office in early 2009.[3]
Marin Software shared plans to expand into Asia Pacific with offices in Singapore and Shanghai in January 2011, this announcement coinciding with the announcement of a partnership with Baidu.[4] In June 2011, Marin Software announced its expansion into Australia with the opening of an office in Sydney.[5] The following year, they opened an office in Tokyo, Japan.[6]




Marin Software has thirteen offices worldwide, its newest office having opened in Portland, Oregon in December 2012.


Between 2006 and 2012, Marin raised more than $100 million in funding. The company reported revenue of $36 million in 2011 and $50 million in 2012.[7]
In late 2012, Marin Software's CEO, Chris Lien, remarked to MediaPost that the company would undergo an IPO in 2013.[8] On February 13, 2013, Marin Software filed with the SEC for a $75 million initial public offering.[9] On March 22, 2013 the company went public, selling 7.5 Million shares at a price of 14 Dollars per share, raising $105 million at a valuation of $425 million.[10][11]
On September 24, 2014 Marin Software announced the launch of the Marin Audience Marketing Suite (AMS).[12]

History[edit]
Marin Software was founded in April, 2006 by Christopher Lien, Wister Walcott, and Joseph Chang. Lien and Walcott are still with the company, with Lien as the Chief Executive Officer and Walcott as Executive Vice President, Product and Technology.
Lien came up with the concept for Marin Software following a brief stint working for an online ad firm in 2005. He realized that search advertisers had no viable software for managing their online campaigns, especially larger advertisers. Lien shared his idea with Chang and a former high school classmate, Wister Walcott. Chang had built J.Crew's website and was a co-worker with Lien at Bluelight.com, Kmart's ecommerce site, when it launched in 1999. Walcott, who came from software giant Siebel, required a bit more convincing. Alongside Lien, the duo drove up and down California's highway 101 in early 2006, interviewing search marketers in Silicon Valley about their experience managing online ads. After a half-dozen interviews, Walcott was convinced that new software was needed.[1]
In April 2007, Marin Search Marketer made its debut and became commercially available in North America, signing Razorfish, Trouvé Media and ZipRealty. Marin Search Marketer has since been renamed Marin Enterprise Edition and is intended for easy and efficient management of large-scale online advertising programs. In March 2011, Marin Software announced the release of Marin Professional Edition, a paid search management application designed for advertisers and agencies spending less than $100,000 per month on paid search.[2]
Marin Software expanded into the European market with the opening of its UK office in early 2009.[3]
Marin Software shared plans to expand into Asia Pacific with offices in Singapore and Shanghai in January 2011, this announcement coinciding with the announcement of a partnership with Baidu.[4] In June 2011, Marin Software announced its expansion into Australia with the opening of an office in Sydney.[5] The following year, they opened an office in Tokyo, Japan.[6]

History[edit]
Marin Software was founded in April, 2006 by Christopher Lien, Wister Walcott, and Joseph Chang. Lien and Walcott are still with the company, with Lien as the Chief Executive Officer and Walcott as Executive Vice President, Product and Technology.
Lien came up with the concept for Marin Software following a brief stint working for an online ad firm in 2005. He realized that search advertisers had no viable software for managing their online campaigns, especially larger advertisers. Lien shared his idea with Chang and a former high school classmate, Wister Walcott. Chang had built J.Crew's website and was a co-worker with Lien at Bluelight.com, Kmart's ecommerce site, when it launched in 1999. Walcott, who came from software giant Siebel, required a bit more convincing. Alongside Lien, the duo drove up and down California's highway 101 in early 2006, interviewing search marketers in Silicon Valley about their experience managing online ads. After a half-dozen interviews, Walcott was convinced that new software was needed.[1]
In April 2007, Marin Search Marketer made its debut and became commercially available in North America, signing Razorfish, Trouvé Media and ZipRealty. Marin Search Marketer has since been renamed Marin Enterprise Edition and is intended for easy and efficient management of large-scale online advertising programs. In March 2011, Marin Software announced the release of Marin Professional Edition, a paid search management application designed for advertisers and agencies spending less than $100,000 per month on paid search.[2]
Marin Software expanded into the European market with the opening of its UK office in early 2009.[3]
Marin Software shared plans to expand into Asia Pacific with offices in Singapore and Shanghai in January 2011, this announcement coinciding with the announcement of a partnership with Baidu.[4] In June 2011, Marin Software announced its expansion into Australia with the opening of an office in Sydney.[5] The following year, they opened an office in Tokyo, Japan.[6]




Marin Software has thirteen offices worldwide, its newest office having opened in Portland, Oregon in December 2012.


Between 2006 and 2012, Marin raised more than $100 million in funding. The company reported revenue of $36 million in 2011 and $50 million in 2012.[7]
In late 2012, Marin Software's CEO, Chris Lien, remarked to MediaPost that the company would undergo an IPO in 2013.[8] On February 13, 2013, Marin Software filed with the SEC for a $75 million initial public offering.[9] On March 22, 2013 the company went public, selling 7.5 Million shares at a price of 14 Dollars per share, raising $105 million at a valuation of $425 million.[10][11]
On September 24, 2014 Marin Software announced the launch of the Marin Audience Marketing Suite (AMS).[12]

History[edit]
Marin Software was founded in April, 2006 by Christopher Lien, Wister Walcott, and Joseph Chang. Lien and Walcott are still with the company, with Lien as the Chief Executive Officer and Walcott as Executive Vice President, Product and Technology.
Lien came up with the concept for Marin Software following a brief stint working for an online ad firm in 2005. He realized that search advertisers had no viable software for managing their online campaigns, especially larger advertisers. Lien shared his idea with Chang and a former high school classmate, Wister Walcott. Chang had built J.Crew's website and was a co-worker with Lien at Bluelight.com, Kmart's ecommerce site, when it launched in 1999. Walcott, who came from software giant Siebel, required a bit more convincing. Alongside Lien, the duo drove up and down California's highway 101 in early 2006, interviewing search marketers in Silicon Valley about their experience managing online ads. After a half-dozen interviews, Walcott was convinced that new software was needed.[1]
In April 2007, Marin Search Marketer made its debut and became commercially available in North America, signing Razorfish, Trouvé Media and ZipRealty. Marin Search Marketer has since been renamed Marin Enterprise Edition and is intended for easy and efficient management of large-scale online advertising programs. In March 2011, Marin Software announced the release of Marin Professional Edition, a paid search management application designed for advertisers and agencies spending less than $100,000 per month on paid search.[2]
Marin Software expanded into the European market with the opening of its UK office in early 2009.[3]
Marin Software shared plans to expand into Asia Pacific with offices in Singapore and Shanghai in January 2011, this announcement coinciding with the announcement of a partnership with Baidu.[4] In June 2011, Marin Software announced its expansion into Australia with the opening of an office in Sydney.[5] The following year, they opened an office in Tokyo, Japan.[6]




Marin Software has thirteen offices worldwide, its newest office having opened in Portland, Oregon in December 2012.


Between 2006 and 2012, Marin raised more than $100 million in funding. The company reported revenue of $36 million in 2011 and $50 million in 2012.[7]
In late 2012, Marin Software's CEO, Chris Lien, remarked to MediaPost that the company would undergo an IPO in 2013.[8] On February 13, 2013, Marin Software filed with the SEC for a $75 million initial public offering.[9] On March 22, 2013 the company went public, selling 7.5 Million shares at a price of 14 Dollars per share, raising $105 million at a valuation of $425 million.[10][11]
On September 24, 2014 Marin Software announced the launch of the Marin Audience Marketing Suite (AMS).[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
The following is a list of acquisitions by Marin Software:

Perfect Audience (June 2014)[13]
SocialMoov (February 2015)[14]

Marin Software received $13M in Series C funding (Amicus Capital, Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, and Focus Ventures) – April 28, 2009[19]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
