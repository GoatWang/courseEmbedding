For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The statistical cut-off date for the receivables in the statistical pool used in preparing the statistical information presented in this Prospectus Supplement is close of business on October 31, 2014, which we refer to as the statistical cut-off date. Cut-off Date: Close of business on November 30, Closing Date: On or about December 10, Statistical Information: Issuing Entity Property: The statistical information in this Prospectus Supplement is based on the receivables in a statistical pool as of the statistical cut-off date. The receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date will be selected from the statistical pool or from other receivables owned by the sponsor. The characteristics of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date may vary somewhat from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool described in this Prospectus Supplement, although the sponsor and the depositor do not expect the variance to be material. The primary assets of the issuing entity will consist of a pool of motor vehicle retail installment contracts (referred to herein as the receivables) collections on the receivables and security interests in the vehicles financed by the receivables, together with the amounts on deposit in various accounts. The receivables will be sold by the sponsor to the depositor and then transferred by the depositor to the issuing entity in exchange for the notes and the certificates. The principal balance of the receivables as of the statistical cut-off date was $1,400,516, As of the statistical cut-off date, the receivables had the following characteristics: S-811 Number of Receivables... 68,938 Average Principal Balance... $20, Weighted Average Annual Percentage Rate % Approximate Weighted Average Original Payments to Maturity payments Approximate Weighted Average Remaining Payments to Maturity payments The receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date will, as of the cut-off date, have an aggregate principal balance at least equal to $913,604, You should refer to The Issuing Entity Property of the Issuing Entity in this Prospectus Supplement and The Issuing Entities Property of the Issuing Entities in the accompanying Prospectus and The Receivables in this Prospectus Supplement and in the accompanying Prospectus for more information on the property of the issuing entity. Offered Notes: The offered notes will consist of the Class A-1 notes, the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes, as described on the cover page of this Prospectus Supplement. One or more classes of notes may be retained in whole or in part by the depositor or conveyed to an affiliate of the depositor. Certificates: The issuing entity will also issue at least $35,416, initial amount of certificates. The issuing entity is not offering the certificates hereby. The certificates will initially be issued to the depositor and may be sold or otherwise transferred on or after the closing date. The certificates will represent fractional undivided interests in the issuing entity and will not bear interest. The issuing entity will not make any distributions to the holders of the certificates, as beneficial owners of the issuing entity, on any distribution date until all interest on and principal of the notes then due and payable on that distribution date have been paid in full. However, no distributions on the certificates will reduce the certificate balance until the notes have been paid in full. Terms of the Notes: Distribution Dates: Interest on and principal of each class of notes will be payable on the 15th day of each month, unless the 15th day is not a business day, in which case such payment will be made on the following business day. The first payment will be made on January 15, Denominations: The notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $25,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. S-912 Per annum interest rates: Each class of notes will have a fixed rate of interest as follows: Class Interest Rates A % A % A % A % Interest Periods and Payments: Interest on the notes will accrue in the following manner, except that on the first distribution date, interest on all of the notes will accrue from and including the closing date: Class From (including) To (excluding) Day Count Convention A-1... Prior Distribution Date Current Distribution Date Actual/360 A th of prior month 15 th of current month 30/360 A th of prior month 15 th of current month 30/360 A th of prior month 15 th of current month 30/360 Interest payments on each class of notes will be paid on a pro rata basis. Principal: Principal of the notes will be payable on each distribution date (other than after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture and an acceleration of the notes (unless and until the acceleration has been rescinded)) to the Class A-1 notes, until the principal amount thereof is reduced to zero, then to the Class A-2 notes, until the amount thereof is reduced to zero, then to the Class A-3 notes, until the amount thereof is reduced to zero and then to the Class A-4 notes, until the amount thereof is reduced to zero, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the sum of (i) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the notes and (ii) the aggregate balance of certificates as of the preceding distribution date (after giving effect to any principal payments made on the notes on such distribution date) (or, in the case of the first distribution date, as of the closing date) over (b) the adjusted pool balance as of the end of the related collection period. At any time the adjusted pool balance shall equal the pool balance minus the yield supplement overcollateralization amount, which represents the aggregate present value (as described below) of the receivables for the related collection period. No distributions on the certificates will reduce the certificate balance until the principal amount of each class of notes has been reduced to zero. Principal payments on the notes as described above will be made from all available amounts after the servicing fee has been paid, certain advances have been reimbursed, and after payment of interest on the notes. S-1013 Interest and Principal Payments after an Event of Default: On each distribution date after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture and an acceleration of the notes (unless and until the acceleration has been rescinded), available amounts (after the servicing fee has been paid and certain advances have been reimbursed to the servicer) will be applied to pay: (a) first, interest on the Class A-1 notes, the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes, on a pro rata basis, based on the amount of the noteholders interest distributable amount due to such class, until the accrued interest on such classes has been paid in full, (b) second, principal of the Class A-1 notes, until the outstanding principal balance of the Class A-1 notes has been paid in full, and (c) third, principal of the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes, on a pro rata basis, based on the respective outstanding principal balances of those classes of notes, until the outstanding principal balances of those classes of notes have been paid in full. Final Scheduled Distribution Dates: The issuing entity must pay the outstanding principal balance of each class of notes by its final scheduled distribution date as follows: Class Final Scheduled Distribution Date A-1... December 15, 2015 A-2... June 15, 2017 A-3... May 15, 2019 A-4... March 15, 2021 You should refer to The Notes Payments of Principal and Distributions on the Notes Calculation of Available Amounts in this Prospectus Supplement for more detailed information regarding payments of principal. Servicing/Administration: Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation will service the receivables. In addition, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation will perform the administrative obligations required to be performed by the issuing entity or the owner trustee under the indenture, the trust agreement and certain other basic documents. On each distribution date, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation will be paid a fee by the issuing entity for performing its servicing obligations in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.00% of the principal balance of the receivables as of the last day of the preceding collection period (or in the case of the first distribution date, as of the cut-off date) and Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation will be paid a fee by the servicer for performing its administrative obligations in an amount to be agreed to between the administrator and the servicer. As additional compensation, the servicer will be entitled to retain all supplemental servicing fees, if any, and any income from investments of funds on deposit in the collection account and the reserve account. The servicing fee, together with any portion of the servicing fee that remains unpaid from prior distribution dates, will be payable on each distribution date from available amounts on deposit in the collection account, and will be paid to the servicer prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the notes. S-1114 You should refer to Description of the Transfer and Servicing Agreements Compensation for Servicer and Administrator in this Prospectus Supplement for more detailed information regarding the servicing fees to be paid to Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. Optional Purchase: The notes will be paid in full on any distribution date on which the servicer exercises its option to purchase the receivables. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, as servicer, may purchase the receivables on any distribution date on which the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the receivables, as of the last day of the related collection period, declines to 5% or less of the original aggregate principal balance of the receivables on the cut-off date. You should refer to Description of the Transfer and Servicing Agreements Optional Purchase in this Prospectus Supplement for more detailed information regarding the optional purchase of the notes. Enhancement: The enhancement of the offered notes will be the subordination of the certificates, the reserve account and the yield supplement overcollateralization amount. The enhancement is intended to protect you against losses and delays in payments on your notes by absorbing losses on the receivables and other shortfalls in cash flows. Subordination of the Certificates: The certificates have an initial balance of at least $35,416, and represent approximately 4.00% of the initial principal amount of all the notes and certificates. The holders of the certificates, as beneficial owners of the issuing entity, will receive distributions on any distribution date only after all interest on and principal of the notes due on that distribution date has been paid in full. However, those distributions will not reduce the certificate balance until the notes have been paid in full. Reserve Account: On each distribution date, the issuing entity will use funds in the reserve account for distribution to the noteholders to cover any shortfalls in interest and principal required to be paid on the notes. If the principal amount of a class of notes is not paid in full on the related final scheduled distribution date, the indenture trustee will withdraw amounts from the reserve account (if available) to pay that class in full. On the closing date, the issuing entity will cause to be deposited at least $2,213, into the reserve account, which is approximately 0.25% of the initial outstanding principal balance of all of the notes and the certificates. Thereafter, on any distribution date while the notes are outstanding, the specified reserve account balance will be 0.25% of the adjusted pool balance as of the cut-off date. On each distribution date, after making required payments to the servicer and on the notes, and prior to making payments on the certificates, the issuing entity will S-1215 make a deposit into the reserve account to fund and maintain the specified reserve account balance. On each distribution date, after all appropriate deposits to and withdrawals from the reserve account, any amounts on deposit in the reserve account in excess of the specified reserve account balance will be released to holders of the certificates. Funds in the reserve account on each distribution date will be available to cover shortfalls in payments on the notes. You should refer to Subordination; Reserve Account; YSOC Amount Reserve Account in this Prospectus Supplement for more detailed information regarding the reserve account. The Yield Supplement Overcollateralization Amount: The yield supplement overcollateralization amount with respect to any collection period and the related distribution date is the aggregate amount by which the principal balance as of the last day of such collection period of each receivable (other than a receivable that is a non-collectible or defaulted receivable or a receivable that has been purchased by the servicer or repurchased by the depositor due to certain breaches), exceeds the present value of each scheduled payment of each such receivable assuming the discount rate of that receivable is the greater of 4.00% or the receivable s contract rate and that the scheduled payments (assumed to be equal monthly payments that amortize the receivable principal balance to zero, using its contract rate, over the remaining term of the contract) are made on the last day of each month and each month has 30 days. On the closing date, the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will equal approximately 3.09% of the pool balance as of the cut-off date. You should refer to Subordination; Reserve Account; YSOC Amount YSOC Amount in this Prospectus Supplement for more detailed information regarding the yield supplement overcollateralization amount. Events of Default: The notes are subject to specified events of default under the indenture, as described under Description of the Indenture Events of Default and Remedies Upon an Event of Default in the accompanying Prospectus. Among these events are the failure to pay interest on the notes for five days after it is due or the failure to pay principal on a class of notes on the related final scheduled distribution date or redemption date for that class of notes. If an event of default under the indenture occurs and continues, the indenture trustee or the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the notes may declare the notes to be immediately due and payable. That declaration, under some circumstances, may be rescinded by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the notes. After an event of default under the indenture and an acceleration of the notes, funds on deposit in the collection account and the reserve S-1316 account will be applied to pay interest on and principal of the notes in the order and amounts described under Distributions on the Notes Priority of Payments in this Prospectus Supplement. After an event of default under the indenture, the indenture trustee may, under certain circumstances: 1. institute proceedings in its own name for the collection of all amounts then payable on the notes; 2. take any other appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the indenture trustee and the noteholders; or 3. sell or otherwise liquidate the assets of the issuing entity, if the event of default under the indenture relates to a failure by the issuing entity to pay interest on the notes when due or principal of the notes on their respective final scheduled distribution dates. For more information regarding the events constituting an event of default under the indenture and the remedies available following an event of default, you should refer to The Notes Events of Default; Rights Upon Event of Default in this Prospectus Supplement and Description of the Indenture Events of Default and Remedies Upon an Event of Default in the accompanying Prospectus. Tax Status: Subject to certain assumptions and qualifications, Mayer Brown LLP, special tax counsel to the issuing entity, is of the opinion that the notes (other than, in certain circumstances, any notes retained by the depositor or transferred to its affiliates) will be classified as debt for federal income tax purposes and that the issuing entity will not be characterized as an association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation. At closing the issuing entity will be disregarded as separate from the Depositor for U.S. federal income tax purposes but may be treated as a partnership should the Depositor transfer any of the certificates to another party (that is not treated as the same person as the Depositor for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or should any of the Notes be characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) as equity of the issuing entity. The depositor will agree, and the noteholders and beneficial owners will agree by accepting the notes or a beneficial interest therein, to treat the notes as debt for federal income tax purposes. You should refer to Material Federal Income Tax Consequences in this Prospectus Supplement and Material Federal Income Tax Consequences in the accompanying Prospectus. ERISA Considerations: The notes (other than those initially retained by the depositor or conveyed to an affiliate of the depositor, if any) are eligible for purchase by a Benefit Plan (as defined in ERISA Considerations in this Prospectus Supplement), subject to those considerations and conditions discussed under ERISA Considerations in this Prospectus Supplement and in the accompanying Prospectus. S-1417 You should refer to ERISA Considerations in this Prospectus Supplement and in the accompanying Prospectus. If you are a Benefit Plan fiduciary considering purchase of the notes you are, among other things, encouraged to consult with your counsel in determining whether all required conditions have been satisfied. Eligibility for Purchase by Money Market Funds: Certain Investment Considerations: Ratings: The Class A-1 notes will be structured to be eligible securities for purchase by money market funds under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Rule 2a-7 includes additional criteria for investments by money market funds, including requirements and classifications relating to portfolio credit risk analysis, maturity, liquidity and risk diversification, some of which have recently been amended. Money market funds contemplating a purchase of the Class A-1 notes are encouraged to consult their counsel before making a purchase. The issuing entity is not registered or required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In determining that the issuing entity is not required to be registered as an investment company, the issuing entity is relying on the exemption or exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, although other exceptions or exclusions may be available to the issuing entity. The issuing entity is not a covered fund as defined in the final regulations issued December 10, 2013 implementing the Volcker Rule (Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act). The sponsor expects that the notes will receive credit ratings from two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations hired by the sponsor to assign ratings on the notes (the hired rating agencies ). The ratings of the notes will address the likelihood of payment of principal and interest on the notes according to their terms. Although the hired rating agencies are not contractually obligated to do so, we believe that each hired rating agency rating the notes will monitor the ratings using its normal surveillance procedures. Any hired rating agency may change or withdraw an assigned rating at any time. In addition, a rating agency not hired by the sponsor to rate the transaction may provide an unsolicited rating that differs from (or is lower than) the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies. Any rating action taken by one rating agency may not necessarily be taken by the other rating agency. No transaction party will be responsible for monitoring any changes to the ratings on the notes. See Risk Factors A reduction, withdrawal or qualification of the ratings on your notes, or the issuance of unsolicited ratings on your notes, could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes in this Prospectus Supplement. S-1518 RISK FACTORS You should consider the following risk factors (and the factors set forth under Risk Factors in the accompanying Prospectus) in deciding whether to purchase the notes of any class. Payment priorities increase risk of loss or delay in payment to certain notes Based on the priorities described under The Notes Payments of Interest and The Notes Payments of Principal in this Prospectus Supplement, classes of notes that receive principal payments before other classes will be repaid more rapidly than the other classes. In addition, because principal of each class of notes will be paid sequentially (so long as no event of default has occurred), classes of notes that have higher (i.e., 2 being higher than 1) sequential numerical class designations will be outstanding longer and therefore will be exposed to the risk of losses on the receivables during periods after other classes have been receiving most or all amounts payable on their notes, and after which a disproportionate amount of credit enhancement may have been applied and not replenished. Because of the priority of payment on the notes, the yields of the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes. Accordingly, the Class A-2 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes; the Class A-3 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes and the Class A-2 notes; and the Class A-4 notes will be relatively more sensitive to losses on the receivables and the timing of those losses than the Class A-1 notes, the Class A-2 notes and the Class A-3 notes. If the actual rate and amount of losses exceed your expectations, and if amounts in the reserve account are insufficient to cover the resulting shortfalls, the yield to maturity on your notes may be lower than anticipated, and you could suffer a loss. Classes of notes that receive payments earlier than expected are exposed to greater reinvestment risk, and classes of notes that receive principal later than expected are exposed to greater risk of loss. In either case, the yields on your notes could be materially and adversely affected. Credit scores and historical loss experience may not accurately predict the likelihood of losses on the motor vehicle loans Information regarding credit scores for the motor vehicle loans obtained at the time of origination of the related receivables is presented in The Receivables Characteristics of the Receivables General in this Prospectus Supplement. A credit score purports only to be a measurement of the relative degree of risk a borrower represents to a lender, i.e., that a borrower with a higher score is statistically expected to be less likely to default in payment than a borrower with a lower score. Neither the depositor, the sponsor nor any other party makes any representations or warranties as to any obligor s current credit score or the actual performance of any receivable or that a particular credit score should be relied upon as a basis for an expectation that a receivable will be paid in accordance with its terms. S-1619 Additionally, historical loss and delinquency information set forth in this Prospectus Supplement under The Receivables was affected by several variables, including general economic conditions and market interest rates, that are likely to differ in the future. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the net loss experience calculated and presented in this Prospectus Supplement with respect to Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation s managed portfolio of contracts will reflect actual experience with respect to the receivables in the receivables pool. There can be no assurance that the future delinquency or loss experience of the servicer with respect to the receivables will be better or worse than that set forth in this Prospectus Supplement with respect to Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation s managed portfolio. Varying economic circumstances may adversely affect the performance of the motor vehicle loans, which could result in losses on the notes Periods of continuing economic slowdown may adversely affect the performance and market value of your notes. High unemployment or reduced availability of credit may lead to increased default rates. These periods may also be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding automobile loan contracts, which could weaken collateral coverage and increase the amount of a loss in the event of default. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic slowdown may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. If an economic downturn continues for a prolonged period of time, delinquencies and losses with respect to automobile loans generally could increase. In addition, higher future energy and fuel prices could reduce the amount of disposable income that consumers have available to make monthly payments on their automobile loan contracts. Higher energy costs could cause business disruptions, which could cause unemployment and a further or deepening economic downturn. Such obligors could potentially become delinquent in making monthly payments or default if they are unable to make payments due to increased energy or fuel bills or unemployment. The issuing entity s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected if the related obligors are unable to make timely payments. See Prepayments, Delinquencies, Repossessions and Net Credit Losses Delinquency, Repossession and Credit Loss Information and Static Pool Information in this Prospectus Supplement for delinquency and loss information regarding certain automobile loans originated and serviced by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation. Natural or man-made disasters may adversely affect the performance of the receivables. Extreme weather conditions or natural or man-made disasters and their immediate consequences could cause substantial business disruptions, economic losses, unemployment and an economic downturn. When any of these events occur, the obligor s ability or willingness to make payments on the receivables, the value of used vehicles or the servicer s ability to administer the receivables could be adversely affected and accordingly the issuing entity s ability to make payments on the notes could be adversely affected. S-1720 Geographic concentration of the states of billing addresses of the obligors may increase the risk of loss on your investment As of the statistical cut-off date, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation s records indicate that the billing addresses of the obligors of the receivables were most highly concentrated in the following states: Percentage of Aggregate Statistical Cut-off Date Principal Balance Texas % California % Florida % No other state, based on the billing addresses of the obligors, accounted for more than 5% of the total principal balance of the receivables as of the statistical cut-off date. Economic conditions or other factors affecting these states in particular could adversely affect the delinquency, credit loss, repossession or prepayment experience of the issuing entity. This Prospectus Supplement provides information regarding the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool (as of the statistical cut-off date) that may differ from the characteristics of the receivables (as of the cut-off date) sold to the issuing entity on the closing date Prepaid simple interest contracts may affect the weighted average life of the notes This Prospectus Supplement describes the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool as of the statistical cut-off date. The receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date may have characteristics that differ somewhat from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool described in this Prospectus Supplement. We do not expect the characteristics (as of the cut-off date) of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date to differ materially from the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool (as of the statistical cut-off date) described in this Prospectus Supplement, and each receivable sold to the issuing entity on the closing date must satisfy the eligibility criteria specified in the transaction documents. If you purchase a note, you must not assume that the characteristics of the receivables sold to the issuing entity on the closing date will be identical to the characteristics of the receivables in the statistical pool disclosed in this Prospectus Supplement. If an obligor on a simple interest contract makes a payment on the contract ahead of schedule, the weighted average life of the notes could be affected. This is because the additional payment will be treated as a principal prepayment and applied to reduce the principal balance of the related contract and the obligor will generally not be required to make any scheduled payments during the period for which it has paid ahead. During this prepaid period, interest will continue to accrue on the principal balance of the contract, as reduced by the application of the additional payment, but the obligor s contract would not be considered delinquent. While the servicer may be required to make interest advances during this period, no principal advances will be made. Furthermore, when the obligor resumes his required payments, the payments so paid may be insufficient to cover the interest that has accrued since the last payment by the obligor. This situation will continue until the regularly scheduled payments are once again sufficient to cover all accrued interest and to reduce the principal balance of the contract. S-1821 The weighted average life of the notes will generally be shortened if the issuing entity applies principal prepayments on the receivables to the outstanding principal balance of the notes. However, depending on the length of time during which a prepaid simple interest contract is not amortizing as described above, the weighted average life of the notes may be extended. In addition, to the extent the servicer makes advances on a prepaid simple interest contract that subsequently goes into default, the loss on this contract may be larger than would have been the case had advances not been made because liquidation proceeds for the contract will be applied first to reimburse the servicer for its advances. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation s portfolio of retail installment contracts has historically included simple interest contracts that have been paid ahead by one or more scheduled monthly payments. There can be no assurance as to the number of contracts in the issuing entity that may become prepaid simple interest contracts as described above or the number or the principal amount of the scheduled payments that may be paid ahead. Risk of loss or delay in payment may result from delays in the transfer of servicing due to the servicing fee structure You may suffer losses due to receivables with low annual percentage rates Because the servicing fee is structured as a percentage of the principal balance of the receivables, the amount of the servicing fee payable to the servicer may be considered insufficient by potential replacement servicers if servicing is required to be transferred at a time when much of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the receivables has been repaid. Due to the reduction in the servicing fee as described in the foregoing, it may be difficult to find a replacement servicer. Consequently, the time it takes to effect the transfer of servicing to a replacement servicer under those circumstances may result in delays and/or reductions in the interest and principal payments on your notes. The receivables transferred to the issuing entity on the closing date may include receivables that have annual percentage rates that are less than the interest rates on the notes. If that is the case, interest paid on the higher coupon receivables and collections related to the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will compensate for the lower coupon receivables. Excessive prepayments on the higher coupon receivables may adversely impact your notes by reducing the amount of interest available in the future to make payments on your notes. S-1922 A reduction, withdrawal or qualification of the ratings on your notes, or the issuance of unsolicited ratings on your notes, could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes The ratings on the notes are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the notes and do not address market value or investor suitability. The ratings reflect the rating agency s assessment of the creditworthiness of the receivables, the credit enhancement on the notes and the likelihood of repayment of the notes. There can be no assurance that the receivables and/or the notes will perform as expected or that the ratings will not be reduced, withdrawn or qualified in the future as a result of a change of circumstances, deterioration in the performance of the receivables, errors in analysis or otherwise. None of the depositor, the sponsor or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to replace or supplement any credit enhancement or to take any other action to maintain any ratings on the notes. If the ratings on your notes are reduced, withdrawn or qualified, it could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes. The sponsor has hired two rating agencies and will pay them a fee to assign ratings on the notes. The sponsor has not hired any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or NRSRO, to assign ratings on the notes and is not aware that any other NRSRO has assigned ratings on the notes. However, under SEC rules, information provided to a hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes is required to be made available to each NRSRO in order to make it possible for such non-hired NRSROs to assign unsolicited ratings on the notes. An unsolicited rating could be assigned at any time, including prior to the closing date, and none of the depositor, the sponsor, the underwriters or any of their affiliates will have any obligation to inform you of any unsolicited ratings assigned after the date of this Prospectus Supplement. NRSROs, including the hired rating agencies, have different methodologies, criteria, models and requirements. If any non-hired NRSRO assigns an unsolicited rating on the notes, there can be no assurance that such rating will not be lower than the ratings provided by the hired rating agencies, which could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes. In addition, if the sponsor fails to make available to the nonhired NRSROs any information provided to any hired rating agency for the purpose of assigning or monitoring the ratings on the notes, a hired rating agency could withdraw its ratings on the notes, which could adversely affect the market value of your notes and/or limit your ability to resell your notes. Potential investors in the notes are urged to make their own evaluation of the creditworthiness of the receivables and the credit enhancement on the notes, and not to rely solely on the ratings on the notes. S-2023 Potential rating agency conflict of interest and regulatory scrutiny Federal financial regulatory reform could have a significant impact on the servicer, the sponsor, the depositor or the issuing entity and could adversely affect the timing and amount of payments on your notes The sponsor has hired two NRSROs to provide their ratings on the notes. We note that a rating agency may have a conflict of interest where, as is the case with the ratings of the notes by the hired rating agencies, the sponsor or the issuer of a security pays the fee charged by the rating agency for its rating services. Furthermore, rating agencies, including the hired rating agencies, have been and may continue to be under scrutiny by federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies for their roles in the recent financial crisis and such scrutiny and any actions such legislative and regulatory bodies may take as a result thereof may also have an adverse effect on the market value of the notes and your ability to resell your notes. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ). Although the Dodd-Frank Act itself became effective on July 22, 2010, many of its provisions had delayed implementation dates or required implementing regulations to be issued. Some of these implementing regulations still have not been issued. The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and significant legislation that, among other things: created a framework for the liquidation of certain bank holding companies and other nonbank financial companies, defined as covered financial companies, in the event such a company is in default or in danger of default and the resolution of such a company under other applicable law would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States, and also for the liquidation of certain of their respective subsidiaries, defined as covered subsidiaries, in the event such a subsidiary is in default or in danger of default and the liquidation of such subsidiary would avoid or mitigate serious adverse effects on financial stability or economic conditions of the United States; created a new framework for the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives activities; expanded the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the SEC; and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), a new agency responsible for, among other things, administering and enforcing the laws and regulations for consumer financial products and services and conducting examinations of large banks and their affiliates for purposes of assessing compliance with the requirements of consumer financial laws.

Fitch Affirms Three Classes of Nissan Auto Receivables 2014-B Owner Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Three Classes of Nissan Auto Receivables 2014-B Owner Trust
    





November 12, 2015 02:27 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms three 
      outstanding classes of the Nissan Auto Receivables 2014-B Owner Trust. A 
      full list of rating action follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the original ratings and make full payments to investors 
      in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of the 
      transaction in this review can be found in 'Nissan Auto Receivables 
      2014-B Owner Trust -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of 
      typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      Nissan Auto Receivables Owner Trust 2014-B
    

      --Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

Excellent Mobile Shopping Experience Raises Likelihood of Test Drive


 






COSTA MESA, Calif.: 13 Oct. 2016 — More automakers are providing responsive and responsive/adaptive websites—sites that automatically reformat to fit the device on which they’re being viewed—yet their satisfaction still trails traditional sites overall, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Automotive Mobile Site StudySM released today.Nearly three-fourths (72%) of manufacturers now offer some form of responsive website—up from 39% 12 months ago—in part because overall mobile usage for automotive shopping continues to trend upward.Satisfaction is important to manufacturers because it increases the likelihood of a shopper taking a test drive. The study shows that among vehicle shoppers who are delighted with their experience on a manufacturer brand website (overall satisfaction scores above 900), 65% say they are more likely to test drive a vehicle, compared with only 15% of those who are disappointed (scores of 500 and below).But designing and executing an effective site that will be viewed through multiple devices is not that easy.  The study finds that when manufacturers launch a responsive or responsive/adaptive site, navigation and speed satisfaction usually experience the biggest drops after implementation. Over time, though, satisfaction with such websites has shown improvement. For example, when examining the first manufacturer sites that transitioned to responsive design, overall satisfaction has increased to 778 in 2016 from 770 in 2014, driven by significant increases in speed satisfaction (771 in 2016 vs. 751 in 2014).“Automotive manufacturer and third-party websites are increasingly being accessed via smartphones by new-vehicle shoppers,” said Deirdre Borrego, senior vice president and general manager of data & analytics at J.D. Power. “With so much at stake, manufacturers and third-party sites have to figure out how to execute an excellent online shopping experience, regardless of device.”Automakers and third-party companies use one of three typical web design approaches:Responsive provides optimal viewing of one layout that adjusts the content display based on the screen size.Adaptive offers several distinct layouts optimized for various device types. Adaptive sites must maintain separate content/asset libraries for each layout, thereby increasing cost.Responsive/Adaptive is a hybrid technique that adjusts the layout/content based on the screen size, but also senses the device type, thus allowing for customized content and navigation for that device type.The study also finds that satisfaction with manufacturers’ mobile websites is quite different between Boomers[1] and Gen Y. Satisfaction is significantly lower among vehicle shoppers in the Boomer generation than among those in Gen Y across all measures: overall (759 vs. 799, respectively); navigation (733 vs. 794); appearance (784 vs. 821); information/content (759 vs. 792); and speed (757 vs. 790).Manufacturer Website Study RankingsInfiniti (805) ranks highest in overall manufacturer website satisfaction, followed by Jeep (803), Dodge (801) and Lincoln (801).Third-Party Website Study RankingsCars.com (751) ranks highest in overall third-party website satisfaction, followed by TrueCar (740) and U.S. News Best Cars (740).About the StudyThe 2016 Automotive Mobile Site Study examines the features and content of automotive manufacturer and third-party mobile websites and their usefulness in the vehicle-shopping process. The study includes more than 11,500 evaluations of automotive mobile websites from vehicle shoppers who intend to purchase or lease a vehicle within the next two years. The study was fielded in July and August 2016.For more information about the 2016 Automotive Mobile Site Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/jd-power-automotive-mobile-site-study.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.comGeno Effler; Costa Mesa, Calif.; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.comAbout J.D.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
