            Don M. Bailey Named Chairman of the Board of STAAR Surgical; Company Announces Senior Leadership Transition
        

2005-04-28Press release 





     - John Bily Resigns as Chief Financial Officer; Deborah Andrews Named
       Vice President and Interim CFO

     - Charles S. Kaufman Named to Newly Created Position of General Counsel

    MONROVIA, Calif., April 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- STAAR Surgical
Company (Nasdaq: STAA), a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
minimally invasive ophthalmic products, today announced that Don M. Bailey,
59, has been appointed an independent member of the board of directors and
will succeed David Bailey, 48, (no relation to Don Bailey) as Chairman of the
board of directors.  David Bailey will remain President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Company as well as a member of the board of directors.  The
addition of Don Bailey expands the STAAR board to six directors and
strengthens the Board of Directors' commitment to corporate governance and
alignment with the interests of shareholders.
    The Company also announced today a transition in its senior leadership
team.  John Bily, 58, has resigned as chief financial officer to pursue other
business interests and he will be replaced on an interim basis by Deborah
Andrews, 48, who most recently was the Company's Global Controller.  In this
transition, Deborah has been named Vice President, Principal Accounting
Officer. A search for a new chief financial officer has been initiated.  In
addition, Charles S. Kaufman, 50, a member of the Corporate Practice Group of
the law firm Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP, has joined STAAR as the
company's first General Counsel.
    "I am delighted that Don Bailey has agreed to join our Board," said David
Bailey.  "He brings to our Company a vast amount of public company and
government related business operating experience as well as a strong
reputation for creating shareholder value.  Don will provide our other board
members with a unique, independent perspective as well as play a major role in
the evaluation of the various strategies we are currently studying to enhance
shareholder value.  In addition, to keep STAAR at the forefront of corporate
governance trends, we have taken the opportunity of Don joining our board to
fully separate the chairman of the board and chief executive officer positions
and Don will be assuming my responsibilities as chairman of the board.  The
entire Board looks forward to his contributions," added Mr. Bailey.
    Don Bailey is currently non-executive Chairman of the Board of COMARCO,
Inc. (Nasdaq: CMRO), as well as an independent investor in and adviser to
various start-up and existing businesses.  He joined COMARCO in 1980 and
became CEO in 1990.  In 1998, he was elected chairman of the board and assumed
the non-executive chairman role in 2000.  During his ten-year tenure as CEO of
COMARCO, Mr. Bailey developed significant skills in strategy development and
execution, change management, business building, acquisitions and
divestitures, balance sheet management, and oversaw significant gains in
shareholder value.
    "STAAR Surgical has tremendous potential for shareholder value creation,"
said Don Bailey.  "I've followed the Company for a period of time as an
independent shareholder and look forward to working with David and the other
members of the board to maximize STAAR's opportunities for success," he added.
    "I would also like to acknowledge the contributions and commitment of John
Bily during his tenure with STAAR," continued David Bailey.  "Our entire
organization wishes him the very best and appreciates Deborah's willingness to
serve as chief financial officer on an interim basis while we conduct an
extensive and thorough search. At the same time, we welcome Charles Kaufman as
a new member of our senior management team.  Charles has worked with STAAR
during the past two years as part of our outside legal counsel team, so he
knows our issues and needs.  We will be consolidating our corporate
governance, compliance, and legal activities under Charles' leadership and
expect that as a result, our overall use of outside consultants will decline,
resulting in a decline in cost of operations in these areas.  Charles brings
an added benefit to our team of having extensive experience with Japan, as
well as being proficient in the language, which should benefit our efforts to
build our Canon STAAR joint venture," said Mr. Bailey.
    About STAAR Surgical

of minimally invasive ophthalmic products employing proprietary technologies.

Don M. Bailey  - Business District

























































Business District











Don M. Bailey



Questcor Pharmaceuticals

Don M. Bailey became President and CEO of Questcor Pharmaceuticals in 2007.  His first position at the company was Interim President, which he held a few months prior to his current role.  He also sat on the company’s Board of Directors a year earlier. Questcor wasn’t doing well when Bailey took over the leadership, and at the time it even seemed like it could go bankrupt, especially when its efforts to gain FDA approval failed twice.  However, with Bailey at the helm, everything turned around and towards the end of 2010, the company did gain FDA approval. Indeed, as the company’s Chairman of the Board, Virgin Thompson pointed out, “Don’s been instrumental in setting the foundation for Questcor’s strategic redirection announced in August. Under his leadership as our interim president, Questcor is now profitable and generating positive cash flows after a history of operating losses. As our new Chief Executive Officer, Don will continue to implement this new strategy and pursue other strategies that seek to generate shareholder value.”
