Boise Cascade Company (NYSE: BCC), which uses the trade name Boise Cascade, is an American manufacturer and distributor of lumber and building materials headquartered in Boise, Idaho.
Boise Cascade Wood Products manufactures plywood, engineered wood products, lumber, and particleboard and supplies a broad line of wood products and building materials through Boise Cascade Building Materials Distribution's 33 distribution locations. Boise Cascade Company is a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BCC.
Boise Cascade Company[edit]
Boise Cascade Company, was established in 1957 as Boise Cascade Corporation, a result of the merger between Boise-Payette Lumber Company of Boise and the Cascade Lumber Company of Yakima, Washington.[1][2]
After over-extending itself into non-traditional areas under young CFO William Agee,[3] the company nearly went into liquidation in 1972. A new management team got the company back to basics through the rest of the 1970s.[4]
The Boise Cascade logo, designed in the 1960s, depicts a pine tree inside the containing circle.[5] The company is run by Tom Corrick, formerly Boise Cascade's executive vice president in charge of Wood Products.
The company is not affiliated with the Canadian paper company Cascades.
The pulp and paper assets of Boise Cascade L.L.C. were sold to an investment firm in 2008, then acquired by Packaging Corporation of America in 2013 and became its Boise Paper division.[6] Boise had entered the paper side of the forest products industry in 1958 with a new mill in treeless Wallula, Washington.[7][8]

Boise Cascade Transforms. Timber Mart-South Market Newsletter, Third Quarter 2004.
Boise Cascade Corporation announced in late July its agreement to sell the company's paper, forest products and timberland assets for approximately $3.7 billion to Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, a private equity investment firm located in Chicago IL. According to BC chief operating officer (COO), George J. Harad, this sale will complete BC's transition from "a predominantly manufacturing-based company to a world-scale distribution company". BC will now focus on its office products distribution business and operate under the name OfficeMax, Inc. BC acquired Office Max last year and analysts have anticipated the current divestiture for about two years. The transaction, expected to close in November, will create a new privately held company, Boise Cascade, LLC with headquarters in Boise ID and W. Thomas Stephens as CEO. Stephens was previously president and CEO of MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. and former chairman, ten years. Companies include Buckeye Technologies, Graphic Packaging International, Riverwood International, Packaging Corporation of America, and Jefferson Smurfit Group. The new company will own Boise Building Solutions with its 22 wood product manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada and Brazil. Four of these are in the South with three in Louisiana: softwood plywood/veneer manufacturing facilities at Florien and Oakdale LA, and one engineered wood facility in Alexandria LA. BC also has one softwood sawmill at its Jackson AL site. The new company will also receive Boise Paper Solutions which has 5 pulp and paper mills as well as 13 other related facilities in the U.S. BC has two pulp mills in the South: one in Jackson AL with capacity of 800 tons per day (tpd) of hardwood and softwood kraft pulp, and the other in DeRidder LA with capacity of 1300 tpd of softwood kraft pulp. Combined estimated pulpwood consumption is about 3.6 million tons per year. In the timberland portion of the assets, Boise owns or controls approximately 2.3 million acres of timberland in the U.S., with 720,000 acres in Louisiana and Alabama.



 
History
Public Land Grants
The corporation now known as Boise Cascade was incorporated as Boise Payette by Frederick Weyerhaeuser and associates in 1913. Between 1913 and 1947, Boise Payette received at least 172,000 acres of the public lands granted to the Northern Pacific Railroad. More information on the railroad land grants can be found in the book Railroads and Clearcuts and from the Railroads and Clearcuts Campaign (www.landgrant.org). Boise Payette and Cascade Lumber (Yakima, Washington) were merged in 1957 into Boise Cascade.
Boise Cascade, Potlatch, and Weyerhaeuser were interlocked from the time of their incorporation by Weyerhaeuser and associates in the early 1900s until the 1980s, through members of the Bell, Clapp, Jewett, Musser, and Weyerhaeuser families. Boise Cascade, Great Northern Railroad, and Weyerhaeuser were interlocked from the 1910s to 1940s, through Frederick and F.E. Weyerhaeuser. Boise Cascade, Northern Pacific Railroad, and Potlatch were interlocked from 1947 to 1955 by G.F. Jewett. The connection with the land grant companies continued into the 1990s, through Northern Pacific's corporate descendants Burlington Northern Railroad and Burlington Resources, whose spin-offs include Plum Creek Timber. Boise Cascade, Burlington Northern Railroad, and Burlington Resources were interlocked from 1981 to 1992, by J.B. Parrish. Former chairman and CEO of Union Pacific William Cook was a Boise Cascade director in the 1990s. 
Over the years Boise Cascade has tried diversifying into engineering, construction, and real estate, but has retrenched to concentrate on producing and distributing paper and other office supplies, and today gets 70 percent of its revenues and 90 percent of its profits from office products and paper (see financial section below).

The following information on bondholders and banks financiers is from Focus on Finance Newsletter, March 2001.
At the end of 1999, the assets of Boise Cascade amounted to a total of US$ 5.1 billion. The following actors financed these assets: 


Shareholders

31.4%


Bondholders

25.8%


Banks

11.9%


Other creditors

30.9% 


 
Bondholders
Boise Cascade and its subsidiary Boise Cascade Office Products have issued various forms of bonds (notes, debentures and revenue bonds) to finance their activities. Outstanding at the end of 1999 was US$ 1.3 billion. As none of these bonds is listed on a stock exchange, it is very difficult to identify the bondholders.
Banks
Boise Cascade and its subsidiaries owed US$ 609 million to various banks at the end of 1999. Three loan agreements are responsible for the largest part of this amount:
1. A revolving credit agreement signed between Boise Cascade and a group of banks in March 1997, arranged by Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, the Chase Manhattan Bank and National Westminster Bank. The agreement allows the company to borrow as much as US$ 600 million at variable interest rates, and expires in June 2002. The agreement also contains an expansion option, which entitles the company to increase the borrowing to a maximum of US$ 750 million.
At the end of 1999, Boise Cascade had borrowed US$ 185 million under this agreement. The importance of this revolving credit agreement however goes beyond this figure: it gives the company the financial ability to react instantly at any investment opportunity which might arise.
The group of banks (with in brackets their nationality and financial commitment) consists of:
Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (United States; US$ 40 million)
Chase Manhattan Bank (United States; US$ 40 million)

2. Boise Cascade Office Products (BCOP), now a full subsidiary of Boise Cascade, signed a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks in June 1997, arranged by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York and the Chase Manhattan Bank. The agreement allows BCOP to borrow as much as US$ 450 million at variable interest rates, and expires in June 2001. At the end of 1999, BCOP had borrowed US$ 190 million under this agreement.
The group of banks (with in brackets their nationality and financial commitment) consists of:
 Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York (United States; US$ 45 million)
Chase Manhattan Bank (United States, US $ 45 million)
Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (United States, US$ 32.5 million)
CIBC (United States, US$ 32.5 million)

Corporate and Public Timber Supplies
Acres of Timberland Controlled
As mentioned at the beginning of this profile, much of "Boise Cascade's" land came from a huge (and improper) public land subsidy in the 19th century. By the 1960s, Boise Cascade held ten billion board feet on 1.5 million acres in the Northwestern, Midwestern, and Southern U.S., and in the Philippines; it had cutting rights to another four million acres in Canada.
Boise Cascade held 2.6 million acres in the U.S. in the early 1980s. In the 1980s it reduced its holdings in the western Cascades, from 597,000 acres to 450,000 acres. In June 1991 it sold another 30,000 acres in western Oregon. Its holdings include 30,000 acres inside the Colville Indian Reservation in eastern Washington. (Cutting rights in Canada transferred to Rainy in 1995).

In 1990, Boise reduced its holdings in the western Cascades from 597,000 acres to 450,000 acres. In 1991 another 30,000 acres were sold in western Oregon. 
In 1995, several mills in Ontario and Boise's cutting rights in Canada were transferred to the Rainy River Forest Products spin-off. 
In 1996, Boise sold 667,000 acres of timberland to Mead Corporation in connection with the sale of its coated publication paper business in Rumford, Maine.
As of 1999, Boise Cascade owns or leases more two million acres in the United States: 1,400,000 acres in the Northwest, 300,000 acres in the Midwest, and 700,000 acres in the South.

Cutting Jobs at Boise Cascade
Mill closures and restructuring reduced employment at Boise Cascade from 35,000 in the 1980s to 22,000 employees in 1997.
Boise Cascade's "Blueprint for the '90s" called for a shift of its pulp and paper operations away from the Pacific Northwest. During the 1980s, Boise Cascade increased its mill capacity in the southern U.S. by 475 percent, while decreasing its Pacific Northwest "westside" capacity by 19 percent, and began selling off timberland:

In 1990, Boise reduced its holdings in the western Cascades from 597,000 acres to 450,000 acres. In 1991 another 30,000 acres were sold in western Oregon. 
In 1995, several mills in Ontario and Boise's cutting rights in Canada were transferred to the Rainy River Forest Products spin-off. 
In 1996, Boise sold 667,000 acres of timberland to Mead Corporation in connection with the sale of its coated publication paper business in Rumford, Maine.
By the year 2001, Boise Cascade's Idaho operations had ceased altogether.

Valsetz was a Boise Cascade company town on the Oregon coast, established in 1924, logged out, and then closed down in 1984. Six hundred residents were kicked out, the lake was drained, the town was bulldozed, the Valley & Siletz Railroad subsidiary was abandoned, and the site was listed as a Superfund hazardous waste site. 
Boise closed its International Falls siding division at Big Falls, Minnesota in December 1984. In 1989, when Boise Cascade hired BE&K as a non-union general contractor for a $535 million paper mill expansion at International Falls, union members held a wildcat strike, demonstrations mounted, temporary housing set up for construction workers was destroyed by arson, and police used tear gas to stop a protest in which rocks were thrown and cars were overturned. 
In 1994, a mill at Joseph, Oregon was closed. 
In 1995, the mill at Council Falls, Idaho was closed, costing 75 jobs in a city of 1,000 residents. and equipment was moved to Papanoa, Mexico. The Idaho site was turned over to the city, which has turned it into a business park. 
In 1996, Boise shut down its paper manufacturing facility in Vancouver, Washington. 
"Shift reductions" displaced 41 employees at Bend, Idaho in 1996, and 26 employees at Cascade, Idaho in 1997. 
In 1998, Boise Cascade closed sawmills in Horseshoe Bend Idaho, and Fisher Louisiana, and in 1999 will close a sawmill in Elgin Oregon and a plywood plant in Yakima Washington -- closures which will cost 494 people their jobs. 
A new "cost-reduction initiative and restructuring" announced at the end of 1998 was expected to eliminate another 400 jobs in manufacturing and administration, 140 jobs at BC Office Products, and 978 layoffs or early retirements. 
In February 2001, Boise Cascade announced it was closing its last two mills in Idaho; the closures are inspiring further subsidies from the state and federal governments. 
When it closes mills, Boise Cascade typically blames environmental restrictions, "the ongoing global financial crisis," the "weak business environment," -- but Boise Cascade's "Blueprint for the '90s" called for a deliberate shift of its pulp and paper operations away from the Pacific Northwest. During the 1980s, Boise Cascade increased its mill capacity in the southern U.S. by 475 percent, while decreasing its Pacific Northwest "westside" capacity by 19 percent. But at the same time Boise is closing sawmills at home, it is "taking steps to access foreign wood baskets." 
 
International Operations
Boise Cascade Office Products is expanding across the globe by buying up office, computer, and paper products companies. In 1996, 19 businesses were acquired, including 4 in Canada and 3 in Australia. In 1997, BCOP bought 8 businesses, including 2 in France and 1 in the UK. In 1998, BCOP acquired another 6 businesses, including 1 in Spain and 2 in Canada. "Executives at Boise Cascade Office Products plan to continue the company's bold corporate growth strategy into... the next millennium."
While it searches the globe for cheaper timber and more office products customers, Boise Cascade is a member of the nonprofit association Buy Idaho. "The concept of marketing goods and services locally is a viable concept," claims former radio station owner Dale Peterson, who is Buy Idaho's Executive Director. Bruce Belcher, a former advertising agency owner and now the president of Buy Idaho's board, said "the backbone of the U.S. economy is still small businesses and homegrown businesses," and "we have a number of people who feel it's a patriotic Idaho thing to support." 
Meanwhile, state and federal funding goes towards picking up the pieces. The Idaho Small Business Development Center has opened offices to aid struggling businesses in Council, Horseshoe Bend, and other towns abandoned by Boise Cascade.
Brazil
Joint venture with Companhia Suzano de Papel e Celulose, a major Brazilian pulp and paper producer, to acquire and operate Boise Cascade's Jackson, Alabama pulp mill.
Joint venture with Grupo Klabin (Papel e Celulose) headquartered in Curitiba, Brazil: Boise Cascade in June 1999 signed an agreement with Industrias Klabin de Papel e Celulose S.A. from Brazil, to establish a 50-50% joint venture (Klabin Boise Madeiras S.A.) to produce and market pine lumber. The estimated US$90 million investment in the sawmill project is financed primarily by equity contributed by the partners and by long-term debt financing from Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) from Brazil. BNDES is one of the few financial institutions in the world that has made FSC certification a requirement for receiving loans from a recently approved credit package to finance the harvesting of timber and other forest products from natural forests. This project poses a new challenge to Boise Cascade, because Klabin's 219.000 hectares plantation area is already FSC-certified. As 85% of the pine lumber will be exported, mostly to the USA, the question rises if Boise Cascade will market these products under the FSC-logo.
Canada
Boise Cascade owns a 47 percent interest in the Voyageur Panel oriented strand board (OSB) venture in Ontario. Boise Cascade operates the plant and markets the 400 million square feet of OSB produced annually.
 
Chile
In 1997, Boise Cascade and the Chilean firm Maderas Condor S.A. (aka Forestal Condor) formed a joint venture named Cascada Chile (later named Company Industrial Puerto Montt, or CIPM) to build a $180 million in a wood-chipping and oriented strand board facility in Bahia Ilque, Chile. The plant would produce 400 million square feet of OSB a year, doubling Boise Cascade's OSB capacity.
An environmental impact study for the project prepared by Dames & Moore (the same consulting form which prepared a study for Trillium's proposed timber project in Chile) analyzed only the impacts of building the mill and port, and not the impacts of cutting thousands of acres of timber to feed the mill. Cascada Chile has published advertisements distorting citizen opposition, and the local newspaper Llanquihue published an editorial supporting the "Ilque and the hen of gold eggs" and attacking opponents as "eco-terroristas."
The public relations firm Burson Marsteller, contracted by Boise Cascade, tried to distort the findings of a technical study done by the department of forestry at the Universidad de Concepcion, but two days later the university foresters revealed the manipulation of their technical report, and declared that the project is unsustainable. When deputies of the House of Representatives visited Ilque in September 1998 to present opposition to the Cascada project, and criticized the Forest National Corporation (CONAF) for irregularities at the local and regional level, the company paid more than 20 farmers to demonstrate against the deputies.
Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the project, one by the local salmon industry, another by adjacent property owners. Another lawsuit charged that the Chilean Congress improperly approved the project. Yet another lawsuit was filed on behalf of NGOs, small farmers, scientists, and local people claiming that the project would violate the constitutional right to a clean environment. And CRS Forestal filed suit against Boise Cascade, accusing it of illegally appropriating the intellectual idea of the Cascada OSB project. 
Chronology
May 1997: Boise Cascade and the Chilean firm Maderas Condor (aka Forestal Condor) formed a joint venture to build a $180 million in a wood-chipping and oriented strand board facility in Bahia Ilque Chile The plant would produce 400 million square feet of OSB a year, doubling Boise Cascade's OSB capacity.
The venture was named Cascada Chile (later Company Industrial Puerto Montt S.A.). Directors included two Boise Cascade vice presidents, John W. Holleran and Karen Gowland; and Joseph S. Munson and Steven Thomas. 
November 1997: Chile Cascade entered two estates (Roll Nro. 2114-29) in the Puerto Montt commune, and took part in locating archaeological and conchales sites in these estates. It cuts native forests without management plans, breaking national laws regarding monument and archaeological sites (decree 701 of forest promotion and law 19,300 of Bases of the Environment).
March 1998: the joint venture's Canadian partners file suit against Boise Cascade , accusing it of the illegal appropriation of the intellectual idea of the Cascada OSB project.
May 1998: The Ministry of National Goods of Chile gives a direct lease to CIPM for both fiscal estates, for a term of 5 years for $1,465,750. The lease is made in spite of knowledge that the company already had violations (file 980211707217 Ministry of National Goods).
May 1998: CIPM environmental impact study prepared by Dames & Moore, the same consulting form which prepared a study for Trillium's proposed timber project in Chile.
June 1998: Several Chileans make an offer before the Ministry of National Goods to purchase the the fiscal estate Roll Nro. 2114-29 as a measure to stop the destruction of the archaeological site. In July the Ministerial Regional Secretary of National Goods rejects the request.
June 1998: The Chilean government and the Demócrata Cristiano (DC) party support the chip project (Llanquihue Daily Chronicle, June 26).
July 28, 1998: The local newspaper Llanquihue publishes an editorial supporting the "Ilque and the hen of gold eggs" and attacking the opponents as "ecoterroristas." Cascada Chile takes out advertisements distorting citizen opposition.
August 1998: citizens of Puerto Montt accuse the president of Corema (Regional Commission of the Environment) and the Intendente of the region of Los Lagos (Rabindranat Quinteros) of being prejudiced in favor the project (Llanquihue, July 8).
September 1998: The Cascada project is accused in the court of appeals of Puerto Montt of destroying archaeological sites more than 5,000 years old. The judicial complaint was presented by the House of Tourism of Puerto Montt, by the deputies Arturo Longton (RN); Guido Girardi (Ppd); Alexander Navarro (Ps), the Association of Industralists of the Tourism, and the president of the Committee of Ilque, and Marcel Claude (Economist of Terram Foundation).
September 1998: Forest Police (OS-5) accuse CIPM and its legal representative Robert Crawford (Boise Cascade) of illegal cutting and asks for the corresponding fines (Part Nro. 12. Second Court of Local Police. Puerto Montt).
September 1998: The Municipality of Puerto Montt asks the department of forestry at the University of Conception for a study of the impact of the project. Public relations firm Burson Marsteller, contracted by Boise Cascade y Maderas Cóndor S.A. (Chile Cascade), distorts the findings of the technical study (Llanquihue Chronicle, Sept 3), but two days later the foresters of the University of Conception clarify this manipulation of their technical report and declare that the project is unsustainable.
September 1998: Deputies of the House of Representatives visits Ilque to present its opposition to the Cascada project criticizing the Forest National Corporation (Conaf) for irregularities at the local and regional level. CIPM pays more than 20 farmers to demonstrate against the deputies.
September 1998: Cascada Chile invites members of the Regional Council (Core), Councilmen (Luis Eagle of RN and Osvaldo Wistuba of the DC), the press (Katherine Bopp of the Daily Llanquihue and TVN) to visit the Voyageur OSB facility in Barwick, Ontario, Canada. 
October 1998: Cascada coordinator Alexander Larenas claims that the Forest National Corporation gave its verbal authorization to cut. Conaf claims it can control the operations of the project (Llanquihue Chronicle, October 10).
October 1998: CIPM, represented by Miguel Aylwin Oyarzun (son of Patricio Aylwin, ex-president of Chile), asks the Service of Geology and Mining of Chile (Sernageomin) for four mining concessions covering 1,100 hectares in Ilque without informing to the Commission for the Environment.
November 1998: Cascada Chile coordinator Alexander Larenas is dismissed for endangering the project with his aggressive attitude. He assumes the position Italo Zunino (Jr).
Numerous lawsuits were filed against the project; as of April 16, 1999:
1. Administrative lawsuit by salmon industry.
2. Constitutional provision against the resolution that approved the project.
3) Criminal lawsuit by the Green Caucus for harm to the archealogical site.
4. Constitutional provision for affecting the right to live in a clean and unpolluted environment; filed by FIMA on the behalf of NGOs, small farmers, scientists, and local people.
5. Another lawsuit by the state for bulldozing the archaeological site (Augustin Ramirez).
In May 1999, the Court of Appeal fined Cascada Chile $825,000 for destroying a 5,000-year-old archaeological site, to be added to a fine for illegally cutting trees.
February 2001: Boise Cascade announced it was cancelling the Cascada project.
 
China
Boise Cascade has signed a $13 million joint-venture agreement with Shenzhen Leasing to manufacture and sell carbonless paper in China under the name Zhuhai Hiwin Boise Cascade Specialty Paper. The manufacturing will be done at a 3,000 ton per year facility in Zhuhai which Guangdong acquired from Hiwin Paper Mills. An additional plant will be built and operated. "[The] aim is to meet increasing needs in China (now 100,000 tons per year and expected to grow 15 percent annually) and elsewhere in Asia. 'China's per capita paper consumption is growing faster than anywhere else in the world,' said Boise Cascade chairman George Harad. Boise will hold 60 percent of the equity and Shenzhen the rest.
 
Mexico
After overcutting the west side of the Payette National Forest in the Weiser Ranger District and lands to which the corporation holds title -- and then closing its Council, Idaho, mill in 1995 -- the company moved some of the equipment to Guerrero, Mexico. Boise Cascade's Mexican subsidiary, Costa Grande Forest Products, began operating a mill in Papanoa, Mexico, in the state of Guerrero, with logging rights to a million acres of old-growth. In June 1995, a protest by farmers about timber cutting left 17 farmers dead and 20 wounded by the police. The state governor resigned and 28 police officers and four officials were jailed. Boise Cascade pulled out of this operation in 1998.
In 1995, Boise Cascade closed its mill in Council, Idaho and moved some of the mill equipment to Papanoa, Guerrero, Mexico, where its wholly-owned subsidiary Costa Grande Forest Products had rented a formerly state-owned sawmill, and supposedly had exclusive logging rights to a million acres of old-growth pine from the local ejidos (land communes), at a price of $60 a cubic meter -- three times what the local mill had been offering. The plan was to cut 100 million board feet over five years, for export to the United States, and operating a second mill in nearby Tecpan. Boise Cascade was paying Mexican workers $4.75 per day. In June 1995, a protest by farmers about timber cutting left 17 farmers dead and 20 wounded by the police. The Guerrero state governor resigned, and 28 police officers and four officials were jailed. Boise Cascade pulled out of this operation in 1998, "due to an inconsistent and seasonal wood supply."
Russia
 Boise Cascade sells Russian lumber to customers in western Europe.
 In the 1960s and 1970s, Boise Cascade's international operations included paper operations in Guatemala and Costa Rica, Guatemala; Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, Venezuela, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, England, Greece, and India., a half-interest in Miramichi Timber Resources, world pulp supplier, New Brunswick, Canada, Triplex Pizano (Columbian plywood and particleboard), Bataan Pulp & Paper Mills and Zamboanga Wood Products (Philippines), and Ebasco Industries (1969 merger of Electric Bond & Share with Boise Cascade; sold in 1973), and electricity production in Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Panama.
 
Labor Issues
Boise Cascade had 22,154 employees at year-end 1997. Mill closures and corporate restructuring reduced employment from 35,000 in the 1980s; strikes were bitter in Maine and the Midwest.
According to the Council on Economic Priorities, since 1988 Boise Cascade has been charged with 350 "willful" negligence violations of worker safety rules.
In 1989, when Boise Cascade hired BE&K as a non-union general contractor for a $535 million paper mill expansion in International Falls, Minnesota, union members held a wildcat strike, demonstrations mounted, and arson destroyed temporary housing set up for construction workers, and police used tear gas to stop a protest in which rocks were thrown and cars were overturned.
In July 1998, Boise Cascade Corporation announced the closure of three US sawmills in Oregon, Idaho and Louisiana and a plywood plant in Washington -- closures which will cost nearly 500 people their jobs. A third mill in Yakima, Washington will be closed in 1999.

Environmental Record
 
The Boise Cascade and the Environment booklet (March 1997) and the nine one-page Environmental Perspectives factsheets (June 1997) contain claims about environmental progress at the company -habitat enhancement, endangered species, clearcutting, air and water quality, and toxics reduction.
  
Toxics
As of the end of 1993, Boise Cascade had been notified that it was a potentially responsible party at 53 federal or state-listed hazardous waste sites. At the end of 1995, Boise Cascade admitted it had "open issues" at 38 sites where it was a potentially responsible party (PRP). At the end of 1997 and 1998, Boise admitted to 33 federal or state hazardous waste sites. The company annually claims that clean-up costs will not have a "material adverse effect on its financial condition" even though its expenses to deal with pollution sometimes exceed its profits. The company claimed to spend $17 million on pollution abatement in 1995, and expected to spend $32 million in 1996; it claimed it would have to spend $200 to $300 million over several years to comply with 1997 EPA rules for utilizing the best pulp and paper technology for reducing toxic bleaching emissions.
 
Sustainable Forestry
Boise claims to practice clearcutting on less than 20 percent of the land it cuts each year.
The following text is from two recent news releases by Boise Cascade.
August 8, 2000: "Boise Cascade Corp. announced today results from an independent, third-party audit to certify approximately 300,000 acres of timberland located in the company's Western Oregon Region. The audit, performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers from May 29 to June 8, 2000, certified Boise Cascade's full compliance with the American Forest & Paper Association's Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFISM) Program standards and assessed the company's proprietary Forest Stewardship Values and Measures. The audit examined forest management practices on timberland owned and managed by the company and on private and public land from which Boise Cascade purchases timber."
October 24, 2000: "Boise Cascade Corp. announced today results from an independent, third-party audit to certify approximately 200,000 acres of timberland located in the company's Idaho Region. The audit, performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP from August 28 to September 1, 2000, certified Boise Cascade's full compliance with the American Forest & Paper Association's Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI(SM)) Program standards and confirmed compliance with the company's proprietary Forest Stewardship Values and Measures. The audit examined forest management practices on timberland owned and managed by the company and on private and public land where the company harvests standing timber. Accompanying the audit team as observers during portions of the audit were six representatives from Boise Cascade wood products customers and two members of the independent Forest Stewardship Advisory Council. The independent Forest Stewardship Advisory Council is composed of nationally recognized conservation experts who have agreed to advise Boise Cascade on forest stewardship enhancements. Council members are: George Brown, Ph.D., dean emeritus, College of Forestry, Oregon State University; David Thorud, Ph.D., dean emeritus, College of Forest Resources, University of Washington; and Jack Ward Thomas, Ph.D., professor of wildlife biology, University of Montana School of Forestry, and chief emeritus, U.S. Forest Service."
 
Political Activities
Wise Use Funding
"In August 1988, the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise (CDFE) held the Multiple Use Strategy Conference in Reno, Nevada. This event launched the "Wise Use" Movement and established CDFE director Ron Arnold as its premiere spokesman and leader. The conference brought together representatives of natural resource industries, right-wing leaders, recreational vehicle users and members of pro-industry "citizens groups' cultivated by Arnold. From these diverse constituencies, Arnold fashioned a coalition whose purpose, he said, was "to destroy the environmental movement." The strategy was to provide corporate funding and support for "citizens" groups that both advanced the agendas of Arnold's industry clients and offered them a populist veneer. Following the conference, Arnold and his boss Alan Gottlieb produced and published what became the movement's bible, The Wise Use Agenda, which listed the top 25 Wise Use goals. Exxon, Louisiana-Pacific and Boise Cascade were among the corporations listed in a directory of the movement found at the back of the Agenda" and Boise Cascade was among the founding funders of the Center itself.
Boise Cascade continues to fund wise use groups including the Blue Ribbon Coalition and joined snowmobile groups in their lawsuit against protection of national forest roadless areas.
Political Money 1997-1998
Lobbying expenditures: $576,500
PAC money contributions: $55,000
Soft money contributions: $16,000
 
Shareholder Resolutions


1995

California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), one of the largest funds in the United States with nearly $100 billion in assets, introduced a resolution to end staggered terms of directors. Not approved.


1997

Resolution to reincorporate from Delaware to Idaho. Not approved.


2000

Resolution to elect directors on an annual basis in order to improve board sensitivity to important shareholder issues. Approved by shareholder vote.



Legal Proceedings
Like most large corporations, Boise includes a statement that reveals its attitude toward criminal and civil liabilities: "We are involved in various litigation and administrative proceedings in the normal course of our business. In the opinion of management, our recovery, if any, or our liability, if any, under any pending litigation or administrative proceeding... would not materially affect our financial condition or operations." 
Boise Cascade Corp. v. U.S. EPA, 942 F.2d 1427, 1432 (9th Cir. 1991).
Valerio v. Boise Cascade Corp., 80 F.R.D. 626 (N.D. Cal. 1978), aff'd, 645 F.2d 699, 700 (9th Cir.) (adopting district court's opinion), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1126 (1981).
Boise Cascade was "recently awarded $1.8 million by an Oregon jury, in a suit it filed against the state seeking compensation for having been prevented from harvesting timber where a pair of spotted owls nested. The state has appealed."
Numerous lawsuits arose from the proposed oriented strand board facility in Chile; see Chile section above.

Boise Cascade Company[edit]
Boise Cascade Company, was established in 1957 as Boise Cascade Corporation, a result of the merger between Boise-Payette Lumber Company of Boise and the Cascade Lumber Company of Yakima, Washington.[1][2]
After over-extending itself into non-traditional areas under young CFO William Agee,[3] the company nearly went into liquidation in 1972. A new management team got the company back to basics through the rest of the 1970s.[4]
The Boise Cascade logo, designed in the 1960s, depicts a pine tree inside the containing circle.[5] The company is run by Tom Corrick, formerly Boise Cascade's executive vice president in charge of Wood Products.
The company is not affiliated with the Canadian paper company Cascades.
The pulp and paper assets of Boise Cascade L.L.C. were sold to an investment firm in 2008, then acquired by Packaging Corporation of America in 2013 and became its Boise Paper division.[6] Boise had entered the paper side of the forest products industry in 1958 with a new mill in treeless Wallula, Washington.[7][8]

Boise Cascade Company (NYSE: BCC), which uses the trade name Boise Cascade, is an American manufacturer and distributor of lumber and building materials headquartered in Boise, Idaho.
Boise Cascade Wood Products manufactures plywood, engineered wood products, lumber, and particleboard and supplies a broad line of wood products and building materials through Boise Cascade Building Materials Distribution's 33 distribution locations. Boise Cascade Company is a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BCC.
Boise Cascade Company[edit]
Boise Cascade Company, was established in 1957 as Boise Cascade Corporation, a result of the merger between Boise-Payette Lumber Company of Boise and the Cascade Lumber Company of Yakima, Washington.[1][2]
After over-extending itself into non-traditional areas under young CFO William Agee,[3] the company nearly went into liquidation in 1972. A new management team got the company back to basics through the rest of the 1970s.[4]
The Boise Cascade logo, designed in the 1960s, depicts a pine tree inside the containing circle.[5] The company is run by Tom Corrick, formerly Boise Cascade's executive vice president in charge of Wood Products.
The company is not affiliated with the Canadian paper company Cascades.
The pulp and paper assets of Boise Cascade L.L.C. were sold to an investment firm in 2008, then acquired by Packaging Corporation of America in 2013 and became its Boise Paper division.[6] Boise had entered the paper side of the forest products industry in 1958 with a new mill in treeless Wallula, Washington.[7][8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
