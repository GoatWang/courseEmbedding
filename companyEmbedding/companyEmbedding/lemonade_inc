How Lemonade Works
Lemonade reverses the traditional insurance model. We treat the premiums you pay as if it's your money, not ours. With Lemonade, everything becomes simple and transparent. We take a flat fee, pay claims super fast, and give back what’s left to causes you care about.*


                A transparent 20%  fee to run everything
            

                We pay claims  super fast


                If there's money leftover,  we give it back to causes

Download.com staff

                                    on February 27, 2009
                    



                This entertaining little strategy game tests your business acumen by challenging you to run a profitable, thriving lemonade stand. For a mobile game, Lemonade Inc.'s colorful graphics are quite pleasing, though you'll need to turn your Pocket PC on its side to play. Each day, you need to buy the proper amount of ice, lemons, sugar, and cups to make sure you don't run out of lemonade. Once your business gets on its feet, you can buy more expensive equipment, switch your stand to a more trafficked location, and take out advertisments. Paying attention to the news alerts and the weather can help you make smart business decisions. The game's feature set couldn't be called massive, but you can at least disable the sound and music, as well as view the temperature in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. You will have to deal with a few nag screens when you shut down Lemonade Inc., but the game is otherwise free. Pocket PC owners who enjoy strategy games will find this title makes a good way to kill the idle moments.

"Needs more upgrades"

                                    June 08, 2003

"Excellent game to cover up travel time!!"

                                    March 12, 2003
                                                                            

                                    2003-03-12 07:50:10

"Great!"

                                    January 26, 2003
                                                                            

                                    2003-01-26 05:20:08
                                                                            

                 | 
                                    Version: Lemonade Inc. 1.0.2
                            

SummaryIf you like the SIMS, you'd like this game.  

Desc: You get to make your own lemonade using your recipe (made of sugar, lemonade and ice) and sell it to different people in different locations (you get to buy your own supplies) You have choices such as equipment, advertising, rent, etc. to help you sell more lemonade (but of course, you have to invest your money in this) You can check how much your assets, revenues, etc. during the game.  The goal of the game is, obviously, gain the most profit.

Challenge: Finding the perfect recipe and corresponding price and location.

Problem is the free download demo is good for one game only.

"It's AWESOME!"

                                    January 08, 2003
                                                                            

                                    2003-01-08 22:20:08

SummaryThe moment I played the trial version, I feel like getting the full version. To those who really like it, get the full version, it's worth the money for PPC!

"One of the better PPC games"

                                    December 31, 2002
                                                                            

                                    2002-12-31 10:10:20
                                                                            

                 | 
                                    Version: Lemonade Inc. 1.0.2
                            

SummaryA very smooth running, easy to learn game that has enough depth to be worth playing for quite a while!

The only negative reviews are people who didn't realize this was a demo.  I guess "Free to try, 19.95 to buy" needs to be translated into a few more languages!  Bottom line is, they wanted to play it more because it's a great game!

"Awesome game"

                                    December 27, 2002
                                                                            

                                    2002-12-27 18:20:09
                                                                            

                 | 
                                    Version: Lemonade Inc. 1.0.2
                            

SummaryThis game is so much fun. I'm a sim freak, and it's great to be able to get my fix on my Pocket PC. The game is beautiful, with cute graphics, and the sounds aren't annoying, either. Installation was a breeze and I bought the full version immediately after playing the trial.

                This entertaining little strategy game tests your business acumen by challenging you to run a profitable, thriving lemonade stand. For a mobile game, Lemonade Inc.'s colorful graphics are quite pleasing, though you'll need to turn your Pocket PC on its side to play. Each day, you need to buy the proper amount of ice, lemons, sugar, and cups to make sure you don't run out of lemonade. Once your business gets on its feet, you can buy more expensive equipment, switch your stand to a more trafficked location, and take out advertisments. Paying attention to the news alerts and the weather can help you make smart business decisions. The game's feature set couldn't be called massive, but you can at least disable the sound and music, as well as view the temperature in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. You will have to deal with a few nag screens when you shut down Lemonade Inc., but the game is otherwise free. Pocket PC owners who enjoy strategy games will find this title makes a good way to kill the idle moments.

"Needs more upgrades"

                                    June 08, 2003

"Excellent game to cover up travel time!!"

                                    March 12, 2003

"Great!"

                                    January 26, 2003
                                                                            

                                    2003-01-26 05:20:08
                                                                            

                 | 
                                    Version: Lemonade Inc. 1.0.2
                            

SummaryIf you like the SIMS, you'd like this game.  

Desc: You get to make your own lemonade using your recipe (made of sugar, lemonade and ice) and sell it to different people in different locations (you get to buy your own supplies) You have choices such as equipment, advertising, rent, etc. to help you sell more lemonade (but of course, you have to invest your money in this) You can check how much your assets, revenues, etc. during the game.  The goal of the game is, obviously, gain the most profit.

Challenge: Finding the perfect recipe and corresponding price and location.

Problem is the free download demo is good for one game only.

"It's AWESOME!"

                                    January 08, 2003
                                                                            

                                    2003-01-08 22:20:08

SummaryThe moment I played the trial version, I feel like getting the full version. To those who really like it, get the full version, it's worth the money for PPC!

"One of the better PPC games"

                                    December 31, 2002
                                                                            

                                    2002-12-31 10:10:20
                                                                            

                 | 
                                    Version: Lemonade Inc. 1.0.2
                            

SummaryA very smooth running, easy to learn game that has enough depth to be worth playing for quite a while!

The only negative reviews are people who didn't realize this was a demo.  I guess "Free to try, 19.95 to buy" needs to be translated into a few more languages!  Bottom line is, they wanted to play it more because it's a great game!

"Awesome game"

                                    December 27, 2002
                                                                            

                                    2002-12-27 18:20:09

SummaryThis game is so much fun. I'm a sim freak, and it's great to be able to get my fix on my Pocket PC. The game is beautiful, with cute graphics, and the sounds aren't annoying, either. Installation was a breeze and I bought the full version immediately after playing the trial.

"Not worth downloading"

About Lemonade, Inc.
Lemonade Insurance Company is a property and casualty insurance company that is transforming the very business model of insurance. By injecting technology and transparency into an industry that often lacks both, Lemonade creates an insurance experience that is fast, affordable and hassle free. Lemonade uses bots and machine learning to venture into territory no insurance company has gone before: an insurance product with conversational UI that will get you insured in no time.
Unlike any other insurance company, Lemonade gains nothing by delaying or denying claims (Lemonade takes a flat fee!), so most claims are handled and paid instantly. Traditional insurance companies make money by keeping the money they don’t pay out in claims. This means whenever they pay claims, they lose profit. This is why getting claims paid fast and in full is sometimes so hard. Lemonade was built differently. By taking a fixed fee from premiums, the rest is geared towards paying out claims. In essence, Lemonade treat premiums as if they were still the policyholders' money and returns unclaimed remainders in the annual 'Giveback'. Giveback is a unique feature of Lemonade, where each year leftover money is donated to causes their policyholders care about. This way, their customers enjoy amazing insurance, and society gets a little push for the better.
Our Chief Behavioral Officer, Professor Dan Ariely, says that “If you tried to create a system to bring out the worst in humans, it would look a lot like the insurance of today.” By becoming part of the B Corp community, rebuilding insurance as a social good, rather than a necessary evil, is now part of our mission. Working in partnership with nonprofits, and baking giving back into our business model holds the promise of a better insurance experience and a more valuable insurance company.

The Change We Seek®
Most Americans view insurance as a necessary evil. Lemonade, powered by technology and driven by social responsibility, changes that, by removing bureaucracy, making getting a policy and getting claims paid instant, and pricing insurance so it's affordable for everyone. It goes further than that: insurance used to be about communities coming together to protect each other when needed. That sort of community-building insurance lost its way. Lemonade's Giveback grows communities around causes they believe in. Every Lemonade policyholder chooses which cause to Giveback unclaimed funds to at year's end, making Lemonade a great way to fundraise for nonprofits. Insurance should be a social good, not a necessary evil.
