Back to topProperty Agreement BasicsWhen dealing with real estate, you want to cover all your bases. A Property Agreement can help address everyone's best interest. After all, property is usually a person's biggest investment. You may be putting hundreds of thousands-or even millions-on the table, so there's no room for mistakes. A lot can happen between the offer and the handing over the keys. Signing a Property Agreement means that both buyer and seller have made a commitment-neither can back out without a good reason, and breaking the agreement usually means paying a penalty. If you're a buyer, you'll likely have to hand over some earnest money as part of a Property Agreement. Don't skimp on the details: create a Property Agreement to give your real estate deal a strong foundation.

Back to topConsent to Sublease BasicsMaking sure the details of a new sublease agreement are clearly ironed out, and documented, is important for everyone involved—the tenant, the subletter, and the landlord all benefit from a Consent to Sublease. As many landlords don't allow subleasing, if you're the tenant you'll need to check your lease first. Even if it's not allowed according to the lease, you can check with your landlord and you may discover they're amenable to a sublease. And as a landlord, subleasing can ensure continuance of rent payment if your current tenant is unable to fulfill their obligations. Whether you're the tenant, landlord, or potential subletting tenant, everyone can be on the same page, in writing, with a Consent to Sublease.
