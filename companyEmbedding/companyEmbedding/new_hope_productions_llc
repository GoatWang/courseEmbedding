Issue 5 MAY, Our Favs 
Masters at Work 

May 13, 2016May 13, 2016 by Emily 


			May has been a busy month. So busy that I have mismanaged my time and have not devoted the necessary concentration to create brilliant and nerdy literature for you. Perhaps what we all need is a break from the deep rhetoric and have a little fun. A few days ago, I …

Film Review, Issue 4 APR 
Ben-Hur: Then and Now 

April 6, 2016April 18, 2016 by Emily 


			In honor of a few simultaneous events going on, I changed this month’s film last minute to Ben-Hur. With it being Paschal tide, and with the announcement of the remake, I felt compelled to share my love for this classic. Although I’m a little upset that they would even consider remaking …

Guest Artists, Issue 4 APR 
Returning to Art: An Interview with Tim Thornton 

April 6, 2016April 1, 2016 by Emily 


			Tim Thornton is an artist based in Colorado. He’s also a musician and a dad and a man who spends most of his time either pastoring or discipling. He recently did an interview with my favorite online magazine And Sons Magazine, and shared his extraordinary story about returning to art. Everything …

Issue 4 APR, Our Work 
Patreon: Artists Helping Artists 

April 6, 2016April 17, 2016 by Emily 


			During the Renaissance, artists of all genres thrived in a culturally conscience society. Art was often (and still is) considered a catalyst in the development of culture which can either be used for good or for evil. Many artistic patrons understood this and wanted to set the tone of their culture by …

Issue 3 MAR, Ponderings 
A Donkey Spoke 

March 12, 2016March 12, 2016 by Emily 


			  In our first issue, we had an article called Story, Stage and Celluloid, which was a watered down, “history of theatre in 10 minutes” type of article. I learned some interesting things in college about theatre that weren’t intentionally taught in class but noticed a pattern… The fact that all cultures have …

Guest Artists, Issue 3 MAR 
Guest Artist – Antonio Romo 

March 12, 2016March 22, 2016 by Emily 


			Below is an interview with life-long, family friend, Antonio “Tony” Romo. Tony has delighted our family for many years with his beautiful and unique music, and we could not be happier to share this interview we did with him. He has the heart and soul of true artist who has …

Film Review, Issue 3 MAR 
The Power of a Joyful Family 

March 12, 2016March 12, 2016 by Emily 


			This is one those childhood norms I had, for which I can only repay my parents with the words “thank you.” If you grew up with The Sound of Music like I did, then that makes us family! Of course, we all love what makes us nostalgic right? However, there …

Film Review, Issue 2 FEB 
Fellowship, Decisions, and Home 

February 15, 2016March 10, 2016 by Emily 


			Last month’s issue discussed how we would take a contemporary film and discover, or at least share, where we see God in the story communicating to us. And I can’t think of a better film(s) to start with than The Lord of the Rings. But first a little back story…I …

About - New Hope Productions







































































About



Art tells a story. Writing, painting, and music all tell a story…our story. Although I discuss and express myself mainly in film, I believe that film making is the combination of all art mediums.
Story allows us to reflect, to ponder, to interpret, to find purpose and healing. I have never believed that people pick up a book, listen to music or watch a movie to “escape.” People get lost in story to be inspired.
I was inspired to start New Hope Productions by someone who changed my life with his stories. He mesmerized and inspired others, but no one was ever quite so transformed than by his very own story of his life, his death, and his resurrection. I believe it is through his story that we interpret and make sense of our own. His is the master story teller, and the master artist and it is to him that New Hope Productions is dedicated.
We hope that you find this community a place of enjoyment and relevance in your life. Although we are embarking out on an adventure and do not yet know all that we have in store at New Hope Productions, we invite you to take this journey with us and see how this particular story goes. We anticipate having more articles on upcoming films so we can not wait to share the next issue with you! Connect with us on facebook and twitter as well as subscribe to receive any updates about our upcoming issues! 
Your fellow artist,

Emily Giuffré
 Emily Giuffré is an author, actor and aspiring film maker. She is currently writing for New Hope Productions’ online magazine, interviewing amazing artists, and working on a few other projects….

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
