0% Intro APR Credit Cards

One of the most powerful financial tools that should be in your arsenal is a 0% APR credit card, which enables cardholders to make large transactions and pay them off slowly without incurring interest fees. If you’re searching for a way to make a large purchase without having to take out a loan or pay back more than the item itself, then it’s highly recommended that you apply for one of the following credit cards. In addition to signup bonuses and great rewards, these credit cards will offer you flexibility to pay back your credit card balance over a longer period of time without being penalized. The following are the most popular intro APR credit cards offered by our partners:

Low Interest Credit Cards

In an ideal world, everyone would be able to pay off their credit card balances in full each month. But the reality is that nearly half of all households in the United States carry a credit card balance from month to month, which means that finding a card with a low interest rate is imperative. Below you’ll find low interest credit cards with attractive rates, which are perfect for consumers who anticipate carrying a credit card balance at times. This will ensure that you pay as little in interest fees as possible, saving your hard-earned money for the purchases you truly want to make. The following are some of our favorite low interest credit cards offered by our partners:

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Rates World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, 
      Series 2016-C
    





November 03, 2016 05:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to World Financial Network 
      Credit Card Master Note Trust's asset-backed notes, series 2016-C:
    

      --$350,000,000 class A fixed-rate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,875,000 class M fixed-rate 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,270,000 class B fixed-rate 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,809,000 class C zero-rate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,573,000 class D zero-rate 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Collateral Quality: The underlying collateral characteristics play 
      a vital role in the performance of a credit card ABS transaction. Fitch 
      closely examines such collateral characteristics as credit quality 
      (measured by credit bureau scores), seasoning, geographic concentration, 
      delinquencies and utilization rate on the cards.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) supporting class A 
      notes totals 24.00% and is derived from 4.75% subordination of class M 
      notes, 3.75% subordination of class B notes, 11.25% subordination of 
      class C notes and 4.25% subordination of class D notes. Class M notes 
      have 19.25% total CE, derived from 3.75% subordination of class B notes, 
      11.25% subordination of class C notes and 4.25% subordination of class D 
      notes. Class B notes have 15.50% total subordination, as they are 
      supported by 11.25% subordination of class C notes and 4.25% 
      subordination of class D notes. Class C notes are supported by 4.25% 
      subordination of class D notes.
    

      Quality Servicing Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing will be provided by 
      Comenity Bank. Comenity Servicing LLC will be the subservicer for the 
      trust. A deterioration of Comenity Bank or Comenity Servicing LLC may 
      affect the performance of series 2016-C.
    

      Some of the outstanding subordinate tranches of World Financial Network 
      Credit Card Master Note Trust may be able to support higher ratings 
      based on the output of Fitch's proprietary cash flow model. Since the 
      credit card program is set up as a continuous funding program and 
      requires that any new issuance does not affect the rating of existing 
      tranches, the enhancement levels are set to maintain a constant rating 
      level per class of issued notes and may provide more than the minimum 
      enhancement necessary to retain issuance flexibility. Therefore, Fitch 
      may decide not to assign or maintain ratings above the current 
      outstanding ratings in anticipation of future issuances.
    

      Criteria Variations
    

      Eligible Investments: Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness, as 
      per the report 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds,' dated Sept. 1, 2016. The definition of eligible investments for 
      this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by 
      Fitch, which represents a criteria variation. Since the only available 
      funds to invest are monthly collections, and the funds can only be 
      invested for a short duration of one month given the payment frequency 
      of the notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable 
      impact upon the ratings assigned.
    

      Eligible Institution: Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness, as 
      per the report 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds,' dated Sept. 1, 2016. The supplemental indenture for WFN 2016-B 
      requires a trust account bank only to maintain at least investment-grade 
      ratings by Fitch ('BBB-'), which does not meet the Fitch counterparty 
      criteria for a 'AAAsf' rated note. Since U.S. Bank, N.A., as account 
      bank, is currently rated 'AA/F1+'/Stable Outlook, Fitch does not believe 
      such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating 
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card 
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a 
      reduction in purchase rate, and 3) a combination stress of higher 
      defaults and lower monthly payment rate (MPR).
    

      Increasing defaults alone has little impact on rating migration except 
      in the most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults, which could 
      result in downgrades. The rating sensitivity to a reduction in purchase 
      rate is less pronounced, with no rating migration even in the severe 
      scenario. The harshest scenario assumes increased defaults and reduced 
      MPR simultaneously. All classes could be downgraded under the moderate 
      stress of a 50% increase in defaults and 25% reduction in MPR.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.

      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

(The following statement was released by the rating agency)
OVERVIEW
-- World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust's issuance is an ABS securitization backed by a collateral certificate representing an ownership interest in the receivables held by World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust. The receivables are generated under consumer credit card accounts originated through various merchant agreements.

-- We assigned our ratings to the class A, M, B, and C notes.
-- The ratings reflect our view of the transaction's credit support, our moderate stress scenario, credit risk, the servicer's experience, and timely interest and principal payments, among other factors.
NEW YORK (Standard & Poor's) Oct. 5, 2012--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services today assigned its ratings to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust's $466.667 million asset-backed notes series 2012-D (see list).
The note issuance is an asset-backed securitization backed by a collateral certificate representing an ownership interest in the receivables held by World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust. The receivables are generated under consumer credit card accounts originated through various merchant agreements.
  The ratings reflect:  
-- Our view that the credit support for each class of notes is sufficient to withstand the simultaneous stresses we apply to our 7.50%-9.50% base-case loss rate assumption, our 14.0%-16.0% base-case payment rate assumption, and our 24.0%-26.0% base-case yield assumption for each rating category. In addition, we use stressed excess spread assumptions to determine if sufficient credit support is available for each rating category. Our purchase rate assumption for this transaction is zero. All of the stress assumptions outlined above are based on our current criteria (see "General Methodology And Assumptions For Rating U.S. ABS Credit Card Securitizations," published April 19, 2010, and "Revised Purchase And Payment Rate Assumptions For U.S. Credit Card ABS," published Sept. 14, 2011). The class A, M, B, and C notes are supported by 25.00%, 21.25%, 16.50%, and 4.0% subordination, respectively, as a percent of the series 2012-D's aggregate note balance. Only the class C notes are supported by a dynamic spread account.
-- Our expectation that under a moderate ('BBB') stress scenario, all else being equal, our 'AAA (sf)' and 'AA+ (sf)' ratings on the class A and M notes, respectively, will remain within one rating category of the assigned ratings in the next 12 months and our 'A+ (sf)' and 'BBB (sf)' ratings on the class B and C notes, respectively, will remain within two rating categories of the assigned ratings in the next 12 months, based on our credit stability criteria (see "Methodology: Credit Stability Criteria," published May 3, 2010).
-- Our view of the credit risk inherent in the collateral loan pool based on our economic forecast, the trust portfolio's historical performance, and the collateral's characteristics.
-- Our view of World Financial Network Bank's (WFN's; not rated) servicing experience, ADS Alliance Data Systems Inc.'s experience as subservicer, and our opinion of the quality and consistency of WFN's account origination, underwriting, account management, collections, and general operational practices. WFN is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alliance Data Systems Corp.
-- Our expectation of the timely interest and ultimate principal payments by the legal final maturity date, which we based on our stressed cash flow modeling scenarios using assumptions that we believe are commensurate with the respective rating categories.
-- The transaction's underlying payment structure, cash flow mechanics, and legal structure.
STANDARD & POOR'S 17G-7 DISCLOSURE REPORT
SEC Rule 17g-7 requires an NRSRO, for any report accompanying a credit rating relating to an asset-backed security as defined in the Rule, to include a description of the representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors and a description of how they differ from the representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms in issuances of similar securities.

0% Intro APR Credit Cards

One of the most powerful financial tools that should be in your arsenal is a 0% APR credit card, which enables cardholders to make large transactions and pay them off slowly without incurring interest fees. If you’re searching for a way to make a large purchase without having to take out a loan or pay back more than the item itself, then it’s highly recommended that you apply for one of the following credit cards. In addition to signup bonuses and great rewards, these credit cards will offer you flexibility to pay back your credit card balance over a longer period of time without being penalized. The following are the most popular intro APR credit cards offered by our partners:

But the reality is that nearly half of all households in the United States carry a credit card balance from month to month, which means that finding a card with a low interest rate is imperative. Below you’ll find low interest credit cards with attractive rates, which are perfect for consumers who anticipate carrying a credit card balance at times. This will ensure that you pay as little in interest fees as possible, saving your hard-earned money for the purchases you truly want to make. The following are some of our favorite low interest credit cards offered by our partners:
