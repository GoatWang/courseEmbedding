A History of L.B. Foster 
Lee B. Foster was only 20 years old when he 
			founded the company that bears his name. Financed in 1902 with a 
			small $2500 loan from his father, L.B. Foster Company has grown for 
			more than a century to become a leader in the manufacture, 
			fabrication and distribution of infrastructure products and 
			materials.
Foster began the company to service a 
			transportation need he recognized while growing up around his 
			father's oil business in Titusville, Pennsylvania. Lee saw that his 
			father received many inquiries from mines, logging camps, and 
			quarries about the availability of relay (used) train rail. Because 
			no truck transportation existed at the time, permanent and temporary 
			rail spurs were the only means for transporting heavy materials to 
			and from jobsites near and far. New rail was costly and Foster saw 
			an opportunity to resell rail that had been retrieved from abandoned 
			and replaced railroads and urban transit systems.
To encourage the sale of used material, Lee 
			Foster initiated a guarantee that set his firm apart from others and 
			contributed greatly to his success: "If the material is not up to 
			the standard represented, ship it back and we will pay the freight 
			both ways." This dedication to customer satisfaction became a core 
			company value and remains today at the forefront of the L.B. Foster 
			customer service policy.
Lee's success attracted the notice of his 
			three brothers, Reuben, Sydney and Byron. All eventually joined the 
			company and the brothers worked well together. Lee changed his sole 
			proprietorship into a four-way partnership in 1918. L.B. Foster 
			Company soon expanded with the opening of new offices in New York 
			City in 1922 and Chicago four years later. The company began trading 
			publicly on the NASDAQ stock exchange (FSTR) in 1981.
In addition to transportation products, L.B. 
			Foster Company began to focus on other infrastructure-related 
			industries for new expansion. Today the company markets its products 
			to businesses involved in transportation, construction, energy, 
			utility, recreation and agriculture.
Lee B. Foster II, the founder's grandson, 
			managed the company as President and Chief Executive Officer from 
			1990 until 2002 and today serves as Chairman of the Board. Mr. 
			Foster provides a vital and ongoing link between the company's 
			industrious past and its current and future success.
In 1999 the company acquired CXT Inc., a 
			leading manufacturer of engineered concrete products for railroad 
			and recreation markets. This acquisition positioned L.B. Foster to 
			better serve customers with a comprehensive line of mainline, 
			transit and industrial rail products. The purchase of CXT also 
			expanded the company into the production of recreational and 
			multi-purpose precast concrete buildings.
At the end of December 2010, L.B. Foster 
			acquired Portec Rail Products, Inc. and its catalog of below the 
			wheel rail items, worldwide manufacturing facilities and 
			knowledgeable professional staff. Newly expanded L.B. Foster began 
			offering a larger line of rail products that included new and relay 
			rail, switches, track lubricating equipment, spikes, anchors, 
			fasteners, concrete ties and wayside data collection systems. The 
			acquisition also provided the Rail Products group with a larger 
			international presence, expanded customer support, additional R&D 
			capabilities and the well-earned goodwill of a century-old company.
As America has grown, L.B. Foster Company has 
			grown as well by providing the material necessary to build and 
			maintain our nation's infrastructure. The company's products are 
			currently being used for the construction and rehabilitation of 
			important projects such as the New Orleans Flood Barrier, Brooklyn 
			Bridge and Panama Canal. As the world's infrastructure continues to 
			expand, L.B. Foster will be there with the products needed to build 
			it strong.
