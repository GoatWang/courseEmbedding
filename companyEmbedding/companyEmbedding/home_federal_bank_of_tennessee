BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 10/01/1958
            

                BBB has determined that Home Federal Bank meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

      SAFE & SOUND® STAR RATINGS™
    HOME FEDERAL BANK OF TENNESSEEKNOXVILLE, Tennessee 37902STAR RATING: 4
    Predictive Indicator
    neutral
    As of
    
        March 31,
      2016
    Federal Reserve System Identifier 105473HOLDING COMPANY INFORMATION(Based on data from the previous quarter.)This bank is not owned by a holding company.INTRODUCTIONU.S. commercial banks are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the purposes of accepting funds for deposit and extending loans to either individual or business borrowers. Banks are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, because of both their public purpose and their importance to the nation’s economy, banks become the object of intense regulatory scrutiny.U.S. thrift institutions are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the primary purpose of  utilizing deposited funds to issue loans secured by real estate.  Currently, real estate-backed loans account for approximately 42% of total thrift industry assets, and one-to-four family residential mortgages comprise nearly 59% of the industry’s real estate loan portfolio. Thrift institutions are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, during the last twenty years, thrifts have made great strides toward reducing historic mismatches between asset and liability maturities.
        The Bankrate proprietary commercial bank rating model analyzes capitalization,
        asset quality, earnings, and liquidity and produces composite and component
        "Star" ratings that can be used as a measure of the rated entity's financial
        safety and soundness. Additionally, early warning components of the model
        highlight operating characteristics of immediate concern and recommended
        follow-up actions. "The analyses are not adjusted for TARP funding and those
        institutions receiving funds may receive ratings that would differ were the
        TARP funds adjusted out of the analyses. You can check whether or not this
        institution has received TARP funding and whether or not they have paid it
        back at http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list/index."

            Early warning indicators identify areas of potential concern, which may lead to financial deterioration and thus, require inquiry or in-depth investigation.
            For this bank we have noted:
          Net Interest MarginNon-Interest IncomeInstitution CommentaryOVERVIEW of InstitutionHOME FEDERAL BANK OF TENNESSEE, which, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        reported $2.1686 billion in total assets.
        At that date, loans and deposits held by the bank amounted to
        $902.165 million and $1.7235 billion,
        respectively. The bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        equity base of $368.451 million produced an Equity/Assets ratio of
        16.99%, as of that date.
      COMPOSITE SUMMARY
        Bankrate believes that, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        this bank exhibited a sound condition, characterized by
        substantially lower than normal overall, sustainable profitability,
        a very high measure of asset quality,
        very strong capitalization and
        seemingly ample liquidity.
      EARNINGS ANALYSIS
        For the twelve months ended
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank recorded net income
        of $12.387 million. The bank experienced a return on average assets (ROA) of
        0.58% over the latest four quarters. Year earlier
        twelve month results amounted to a net income
        of $12.442 million, or a
        0.58%
        ROA over the most recent four quarters at that time. An ROA of at least 1.0% is deemed satisfactory in accordance with banking
        industry standards, and the industry's annualized ROA for the twelve months
        of 2016 was approximately 0.95% for commercial banks
        and 1.25% for thrift institutions.
      
        We have concluded that for the four quarters ending
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank achieved a below average
        return on equity.
        We deem net interest margin to have been substantially below average, and the reported percentage should cause inquiry into balance sheet composition, asset yields, and liability costs.
        Noninterest income was substantially below normal, and management should be questioned as to the outlook for this source of revenue.
        We also observed overhead ratios that were well below standard, a sign of strict expense control.
        Importantly, net interest margins, noninterest income components, and overhead expense levels
        represent operating factors that combine to impact overall operating results.
        ASSET QUALITY ANALYSIS
        The bank revealed, as previously stated, a very high measure of
        asset quality. Our conclusion with respect to asset quality incorporates our analysis
        of data depicting regional economic conditions as well as our computations of
        a relatively low
            March 31,
          2016 nonperforming asset ratio,
        better than normal
        reserve coverage for nonperforming loans; and
        apparently acceptable quality, or no greater than average,
        holdings of commercial real estate and construction loans, two categories
        that can intensify credit risk.
        
          Other asset categories, such as farm and consumer loans, which may carry
          more than usual default potential, should not have a substantial negative impact
          upon future results.
        Loan yield can measure financial reward versus credit risk. Excessive loan yield may be an
        indicator of existing or future problems. Our loan review indicates that the bank has assumed a
        seemingly prudent position between credit risk and financial reward.
        CAPITAL ANALYSIS
        For the one year period ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank reported
        an approximately normal rate of growth in equity capital.
        Balance sheet structural changes, through the one year period of time ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, have
        improved
        the bank's capital position. Our analytical methodology does take into account the quantity,
        quality, and durability of net worth, and, as set forth above, we have determined, based upon
        our series of tests, that the bank demonstrates
        very strong
        capitalization. We have calculated the bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        Total Risk-Based Capital position, a computation used by industry regulators, and have concluded
        that this bank substantially exceeded
        the requirement, set by regulation, for this test.
        LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS
        As of
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank displayed
        Substantially Below Normal
        balance sheet liquidity and a
        No Greater Than Average Dependence
        upon wholesale, or non-core liabilities, which include all borrowings, such as Federal Home
        Loan Bank Advances, and CD's greater than $250,000.
        
        Accounting principles require some securities to be categorized as "Available-for-Sale."
        Changes in market value of these securities are reflected through the GAAP (Generally
        Accepted Accounting Principles) net worth of the institution. Based upon the bank's
        present balance sheet, changes in the value of the current level of securities reported
        as "Available-for-Sale"
        might not have a substantial impact
        upon future net worth of the bank.
      INSTITUTION SUMMARY
        This bank has been rated
        sound.
      
          Negative factors that impacted that rating follow:Earnings
          Positive factors that impacted that rating follow:Asset QualityCapitalization
          As noted previously, early warning indicators, possibly requiring specific
          investigation include:
        Net Interest MarginNon-Interest IncomePREDICTIVE INDICATOR
        As stated, we have determined a composite Star rating for this bank of
        
            4
            
        , indicative of a
        sound
        financial condition. At times, financial conditions of banks change rapidly and significantly.
        Hence, our Safe & Sound Star ratings should not be deemed predictive of likely future ratings.
        However, in view of early warning indicators set forth within this report, in combination with
        the institution's financial data, we believe that the Star rating for this institution is
