Description

                    The second edition of Computational Fluid Dynamics represents a significant improvement from the first edition. However, the original idea of including all computational fluid dynamics methods (FDM, FEM, FVM); all mesh generation schemes; and physical applications to turbulence, combustion, acoustics, radiative heat transfer, multiphase flow, electromagnetic flow, and general relativity is still maintained. The second edition includes a new section on preconditioning for EBE-GMRES and a complete revision of the section on flowfield-dependent variation methods, which demonstrates more detailed computational processes and includes additional example problems. For those instructors desiring a textbook that contains homework assignments, a variety of problems for FDM, FEM and FVM are included in an appendix. To facilitate students and practitioners intending to develop a large-scale computer code, an example of FORTRAN code capable of solving compressible, incompressible, viscous, inviscid, 1D, 2D and 3D for all speed regimes using the flowfield-dependent variation method is made available.show more

Item Description: CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS, United Kingdom, 2014. Paperback. Book Condition: New. 2nd Revised edition. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. The second edition of Computational Fluid Dynamics represents a significant improvement from the first edition. However, the original idea of including all computational fluid dynamics methods (FDM, FEM, FVM); all mesh generation schemes; and physical applications to turbulence, combustion, acoustics, radiative heat transfer, multiphase flow, electromagnetic flow, and general relativity is still maintained. The second edition includes a new section on preconditioning for EBE-GMRES and a complete revision of the section on flowfield-dependent variation methods, which demonstrates more detailed computational processes and includes additional example problems. For those instructors desiring a textbook that contains homework assignments, a variety of problems for FDM, FEM and FVM are included in an appendix. To facilitate students and practitioners intending to develop a large-scale computer code, an example of FORTRAN code capable of solving compressible, incompressible, viscous, inviscid, 1D, 2D and 3D for all speed regimes using the flowfield-dependent variation method is made available.

[" Increasingly, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are being used to study and solve complex fluid flow and heat transfer problems. This comprehensive book ranges from elementary concepts for the beginner to state-of-the-art CFD for the practitioner. It begins with CFD preliminaries, in which the basic principles of finite difference (FD), finite element (FE), and finite volume (FV) methods are discussed and illustrated through examples, with step-by-step hand calculations.,." -.

Item Description: Cambridge University Press. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Paperback. 1056 pages. Dimensions: 9.7in. x 6.9in. x 1.6in.The second edition of Computational Fluid Dynamics represents a significant improvement from the first edition. However, the original idea of including all computational fluid dynamics methods (FDM, FEM, FVM); all mesh generation schemes; and physical applications to turbulence, combustion, acoustics, radiative heat transfer, multiphase flow, electromagnetic flow, and general relativity is still maintained. This unique approach sets this book apart from its competitors and allows the instructor to adopt this book as a text and choose only those subject areas of his or her interest. The second edition includes a new section on preconditioning for EBE-GMRES and a complete revision of the section on flowfield-dependent variation methods, which demonstrates more detailed computational processes and includes additional example problems. For those instructors desiring a textbook that contains homework assignments, a variety of problems for FDM, FEM, and FVM are included in an appendix. To facilitate students and practitioners intending to develop a large-scale computer code, an example of FORTRAN code capable of solving compressible, incompressible, viscous, inviscid, 1D, 2D, and 3D for all speed regimes using the flowfield-dependent variation method is made available. This item ships from multiple locations. Your book may arrive from Roseburg,OR, La Vergne,TN. Paperback.  Bookseller Inventory # 9781107425255
