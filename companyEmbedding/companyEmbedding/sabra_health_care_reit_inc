Sabra Health Care REIT Stock Sees Short Interest Move 17.2% Lower
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, which shows a 1,273,832 share decrease in total short interest for Sabra Health Care REIT Inc , to 6,116,085, a decrease of 17.24% since 04/13/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Reiterates Board's Unanimous Recommendation that Sabra Shareholders Vote "FOR" the Proposed Merger with Care
 Capital 
Properties

IRVINE, Calif., July  28, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. ("Sabra" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:SBRA) today filed an investor presentation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") highlighting the substantial strategic and financial benefits of its previously announced definitive merger agreement with Care Capital Properties, Inc. ("CCP") (NYSE:CCP) to create a premier healthcare REIT. The presentation is available on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://www.sabrahealth.com/file.aspx?iid=4259507&fid=1001226103.
Sabra's Board of Directors, following a thorough evaluation with its outside financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the proposed merger with CCP is in the best interest of Sabra's shareholders. Sabra maintains an open dialogue with its shareholders and values all constructive input towards its goal of driving enhanced value. Since announcing the merger, the Company has engaged with many of its shareholders and is pleased with the support it has received for the transaction. The Company has carefully reviewed the letters and presentation issued by Hudson Bay Capital ("Hudson Bay") and Eminence Capital ("Eminence") regarding the transaction, which included inaccurate and misleading statements that Sabra refutes in the presentation filed today.
Highlights of the presentation include:

Sabra's Board and management team continue to strongly support this strategically important transaction. The transaction provides Sabra and its shareholders with critical strategic benefits. It accomplishes the Company's stated objectives of diversifying its tenant base to decrease concentration from its top five tenants, delivering significant value creation and dividend growth, increasing scale, and achieving investment grade credit ratings and balance sheet strength. All of these benefits give the Company increased competitive advantages in acquiring additional assets, as well as providing increased shareholder liquidity.Hudson Bay and Eminence overlook all of these strategic benefits to the Company and emphasize risks associated with the transaction, primarily based upon an oversimplified view on the skilled nursing facility ("SNF") sector, with which Sabra and other experienced SNF investors do not agree.
The transaction is entirely consistent with Sabra's stated strategy of creating a balanced portfolio across SNF and senior housing assets. The suggestion by Hudson Bay and Eminence that the transaction represents a deviation in strategy is highly misleading. SNFs are a core component of the Company's asset base and strategy, representing 57% of its portfolio prior to the transaction. Since its spin-off from Sun Healthcare, the Company has acquired approximately $700 million in skilled nursing assets and in recent quarters has consistently discussed the strong weighting in its pipeline of M&A opportunities towards skilled nursing assets, given the current attractiveness of those opportunities relative to senior housing. The Company remains nimble and opportunistic and will continue to accretively pursue high-quality assets that drive value for shareholders, irrespective of the asset class.The increased scale, expected improved cost of capital, and strong balance sheet as a result of the merger will make Sabra more competitive and open up new investment opportunities that are not available as a standalone company. With its enhanced financial strength following the completion of the transaction, Sabra will continue to diversify its portfolio by tenant and facility type by executing on these attractive opportunities that will now be available.
The transaction provides significant value creation for shareholders. In their analyses of the transaction, Hudson Bay and Eminence ignore the significant value creation opportunity for Sabra shareholders. The acquisition is expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately $20 million. Sabra expects to achieve lower cost of capital through achieving investment grade credit ratings. The transaction creates immediate and significant cash flow accretion that provides the potential for a meaningful near-term dividend increase and value creation, which is discussed in further detail in the investor presentation.


CCP's tenants are good operators with quality assets - in the SNF industry, it's the operator that matters. Skilled nursing remains an integral component of the U.S. continuum of care. The shift to lower cost of care settings favors quality SNF operators over the long term. SNFs continue to provide significant opportunities for attractive risk adjusted returns for sophisticated and experienced healthcare investors that are able to partner with successful operators on the right assets. Skilled nursing benefits from the same demographic shifts as independent or assisted living, without the oversupply concerns. Additionally, SNFs benefit from over 200 bps of wider cap rates, as well as a net lease structure, which limits operating risk and rent variability and can offset reimbursement concerns.CCP has quality operators and the Sabra management team is confident it can maximize the performance of CCP's assets. Sabra has strong relationships with many of the CCP operators through existing or previous investments in the space and this transaction creates enhanced growth opportunities to strategically partner with top operators. CCP's recent acquisition in the behavioral health space also provides increased opportunities to expand within that segment of healthcare.


Sabra management team has substantial operating experience to manage the combined company. The Sabra management team brings more than 100 combined years of experience in the industry. Sabra's management team is a leader in the SNF industry and has tremendous experience owning and managing SNF portfolios. Sabra has consistently demonstrated an ability to improve the performance of its portfolio, delivering quarterly SNF coverage growth from 1.25x to 1.54x since the first quarter of 2015, a 23% increase. The Company believes it can utilize this core area of expertise to provide additional value in managing the CCP portfolio going forward.The Company believes Hudson Bay's and Eminence's discussion and analysis of the potential rent repositioning are misleading and oversimplify the strategic and nuanced approach the Sabra management team is experienced in undertaking. Sabra's repositioning of CCP's leases will be focused on optimizing rent for reinvestment, improving operations with tenants the Sabra management team knows well and restructuring with a handful of tenants that can execute a successful facility turnaround. The Company's efforts are focused on tenants that provide quality care with high skilled mix, which represents higher patient acuity and therefore higher reimbursement rates.
Sabra believes Hudson Bay and Eminence are new Sabra shareholders, are new to the story and have provided no alternatives for long-term value creation. Despite Hudson Bay's and Eminence's claimed concern for the long-term, the Company believes that both became shareholders only after the announcement of the CCP transaction. As both shareholders are new investors to the story, Hudson Bay's and Eminence's broad-brush assertions in relation to SNFs show a lack of appreciation for the distinctions in quality among SNF operators and other nuances important in properly evaluating an acquisition in the sector.The value creation thesis put forward by these new shareholders is predicated on a reversal of the recent, transient dislocation in Sabra's share price that followed the announcement of the CCP transaction without regard to its potential for long-term value creation. Hudson Bay and Eminence have proposed no strategic alternative that would benefit shareholders over the long term in the way that the Company believes the transaction with CCP will.The Company encourages shareholders to question the ultimate motivation behind the public statements by Hudson Bay and Eminence as well as the alignment of these funds with the long-term interests of the Company and its other shareholders.
The Board and management are confident that this is the right transaction for Sabra shareholders, at the right value. In its presentation, Hudson Bay included a page directly sourced from another company's investor presentation that asserted that "SNF transactions have fallen within the 9-10% cap range." However, Hudson Bay failed to disclose the information from the same presentation that noted the transactions analyzed related to higher-yielding, smaller, one-off deals. CCP is very different and brings a large, diversified portfolio that is fairly and efficiently priced every day in the public market. Their presentations completely ignore the value of the strong balance sheet and investment grade ratings that CCP brings to Sabra.  As disclosed in Sabra's proxy statement, given the compelling strategic benefits of the transaction, the companies have been considering a combination since July 2016, during which time the exchange ratio implied by the public trading prices of the two companies' stocks has moved substantially in Sabra's favor.In their analysis of the transaction, Hudson Bay and Eminence also fail to recognize the direct positive correlation between rent coverage and valuation multiples observed in the public market, and how the Company expects to create significant value through portfolio optimization.  The management team's experience and knowledge of the operators will enable Sabra to work with tenants to assist those operators to improve facility operations and enhance rent coverage in the same manner that the Company has demonstrated with its own portfolio.Additionally, based on the CCP stock price on May 5, 2017, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger, the implied premium was 11.8%, which is lower than average "control" premiums paid in precedent public company Healthcare REIT transactions.
Sabra is encouraged by the strong level of support from shareholders and positive commentary from Wall Streetanalysts following the transaction. Since announcing the transaction, the Company has spoken at length with many of its long-term shareholders, and has received strong support for the transaction. Many of the shareholders that the Company has spoken with clearly understand the rationale and benefits of the merger. Sabra has also articulated the management team's ability to create value from the transaction, as well as the scale and financial benefits that will come from being a larger, diversified REIT with investment grade metrics. Industry analyst commentary from reports regarding the CCP merger highlight these and other benefits for shareholders:1- "We believe that the combination of SBRA and CCP highlights the growing discrepancy between the public and private market value of senior housing, particularly skilled nursing, and we expect it to spark greater enthusiasm for REITs and operators focused on the sector. SBRA's combination with CCP, which they estimate is 14%-16% accretive in the first full year, creates a much larger health care REIT that is considerably more diversified and continues the companies' focus on senior housing, especially skilled nursing." (Cantor Fitzgerald, May 8, 2017)- "Despite the mixed reception of the pending Sabra-Care Capital Properties (CCP, $25.87, NR) merger, we remain positive on the deal. We acknowledge near term hurdles, but believe the opportunity and long term benefits more than outweigh the short term volatility." (SunTrust, July 20, 2017)- "A strong positive is the diversification the deal brings with no one tenant representing more than 11% of annualized cash NOI once SBRA's previously announced Genesis dispositions are closed and CCP closes its previously announced behavioral hospitals acquisition. Sabra on a stand-alone basis has 32% exposure to Genesis as a tenant and 16% to Holiday. Per the press release concerning the deal, SBRA expects the deal to be 14-16% accretive to AFFO in the first full year which our analysis supports. Drivers of accretion include 1) $20M of synergies; 2) assumption of relatively cheap debt from CCP." (Jefferies, May 8, 2017)- "Sabra Health Care REIT ( SBRA ) announced that it is merging with healthcare REIT peer, Care Capital Properties (CCP - Unrated) in an all stock deal. We believe that this is a surprise to investors and could actually support SBRA's current valuation as tenant concentration in its top 2 tenants declines significantly, which has been somewhat of an overhang on valuation, in our view. Getting to a pro forma market cap of $4B+ (up from the current $1.8B) would help with improving relevance with investors and ratings agencies, in our view." (Wells Fargo, May 8, 2017)- "The balance sheet will be strong and trading liquidity should improve, and would also allow for more flexibility to manage the portfolio through asset sales given the increased size/scale." (Mizuho, May 7, 2017)- "We believe the company will have strong leadership as Sabra management is well thought of in the investment community." (Stifel, May 7, 2017)1 Permission to use quotations neither sought nor obtained 
Sabra's management team's interests are directly aligned with all Sabra shareholders. Sabra's CEO is a top ten shareholder of the Company and has a strong belief in the value creation opportunities from the transaction. In addition, Sabra's executive team has always elected to take their annual bonus in stock rather than cash, further demonstrating their belief in the Company. Two-thirds of management equity compensation is performance based (including TSR), which is substantially more than the industry norm.             

The Sabra Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Sabra shareholders vote "FOR" the CCP transaction at the upcoming special meeting of stockholders.

NEW YORK, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Eminence Capital, LP, which owns 3.9 percent of the common stock of Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (NASDAQ:   SBRA), today sent the following letter to the Board of Directors regarding their announced merger with Care Capital Properties Inc. (NYSE:   CCP):
July 24, 2017








Richard K. Matros, Chairman  Board of Directors  Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.  18500 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 550  Irvine, CA 92612
Dear Chairman Matros and Members of the Board of Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.,
We are writing this letter in regard to your proposed acquisition of Care Capital Properties (NYSE:   CCP) ("CCP"), announced May 7, 2017.  Eminence Capital, LP owns 3.9% of Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (NASDAQ:   SBRA) ("Sabra" or the "Company") and plans to vote against the deal.  Our opinion is predicated on the following:

Skilled nursing facilities ("SNFs") are under tremendous pressure, for various reasons, and we see no end in sight.  CCP is 80-85% exposed to SNFs and, in our view, its SNF portfolio, in particular, is terribly positioned to navigate through this increasingly challenged industry. 
These pressures will drive larger rent cuts and more dramatic portfolio repositioning versus what the Company represents, resulting in value destruction for shareholders.  The Company is swapping its own valuable currency for CCP assets that will be worth materially less three-to-five years from now. 
In its public filings, the Company makes it clear that asset class diversification is an "achievement."  We therefore have serious questions with respect to the motivation and rationale for this deal. 
While we emphasize poor strategic fit as our primary issue with the transaction, the price Sabra is paying is also meaningfully too high.

Below are the specific and significant challenges faced by CCP: 

As of the first quarter of 2017, 65% of rents were covered at less than 1.2x EBITDAR[1], up dramatically from 38% just one quarter ago and 25% one year ago. In retrospect, Sabra management's claims during its first quarter 2017 earnings call (which was held before CCP released its first quarter 2017 earnings supplement) that CCP's portfolio had not deteriorated relative to the prior quarter were clearly disingenuous. 
56% of rents are concentrated in its top-five operators where the combined coverage is 1.1x, and overall portfolio "same-store" cash rents are in year-over-year decline. 
Signature Healthcare, CCP's second largest tenant representing 15% of rent, is going through significant financial distress and could very likely need to file for bankruptcy protection. Sabra management is well aware of this but, we believe that, based on the continued industry stress, this is not a straight forward situation where coverage needs to be reset at a modestly higher level. Signature could have continued deterioration for years to come that needs to be considered. 
On its third quarter 2016 earnings conference call and during subsequent follow-up conversations, CCP began talking about some of its tenants requesting rent concessions which, when coupled with the trends in coverage, is very concerning. 
The CCP portfolio's average "star rating" is among the worst in the industry relative to other large or REIT-owned portfolios, a reflection of poor-quality assets. The "quality rating system" is a program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ("CMS"), and is increasingly being used by SNF referral sources as a means to determine which SNFs to partner with and where to send patient referrals. A difficult operating environment makes it extremely challenging to turn these assets around.

These trends and absolute levels of portfolio coverage are particularly problematic given our belief that industry conditions will remain just as poor, if not deteriorate further during the coming years.  Based on extensive primary research, our view is that SNF industry profitability will decline meaningfully over the next three-to-five years.  The primary drivers of this fundamental outlook are:

Traditional Medicare (FFS) to Medicare Advantage – SNFs have seen and will continue to see tremendous profit pressure from a mix-shift towards Medicare Advantage, now representing roughly one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries, which carries significantly shorter lengths of stay and lower per diem payments to SNFs. Medicare represents the large majority of industry profitability given its extremely high profit margins relative to Medicaid. We believe the strong growth in Medicare Advantage penetration will continue, as will the consequent pressure on SNF profitability. 
Value-Based Reimbursement – SNF referral sources (hospitals in particular) are becoming increasingly responsible for, and incentivized around, managing a patient's overall cost and quality of care (i.e. before, during and after the hospital stay). This shift from volume to value exposes waste within the healthcare continuum by forcing hospitals to more strongly consider the highest-quality, lowest-cost sites of care. SNFs are very poorly positioned in this debate – hospitals are cutting SNF referral networks by more than 50% and shortening lengths of stay for patients they do still send to SNFs. 
Cost Inflation – Labor/nursing, the largest cost item for SNFs, is feeling the effects of wage inflation. Nursing turnover at SNFs can be incredibly high, and these facilities struggle to recruit and retain top talent (a) in a world of staffing supply shortages and (b) given the competitive disadvantages versus deeper-pocketed hospitals. We believe wage inflation has moved from 2-3% to more like 3-4%+, which can be troublesome when SNF revenues are declining. 
Added Regulatory Burden – The majority of SNFs are 30-40 years old and in need of massive capital investment. These lower-quality, underinvested facilities play a role in the poor quality and compliance controls known to the industry. Not surprisingly, we have witnessed an increased number of government investigations into various players in the space. In addition, newly passed regulations require SNFs to comply with time-intensive and costly mandates. 
Reimbursement Risk – For years and, to a greater extent, more recently, certain independent advisory groups and regulatory authorities have recommended payment reform for SNFs which, in our opinion, is a function of flaws in the current payment system and misaligned incentives leading to generous Medicare margins. Over the years, SNFs have increasingly billed for the highest categories of therapy, despite key characteristics of SNF beneficiaries remaining unchanged, resulting in billions in overpayments. We believe significant payment reform will take place in the foreseeable future, and that it is likely to be negative for SNFs. 
Traditional Medicaid to Managed Medicaid – States are increasingly outsourcing the management and reimbursement for SNF patient populations to Managed Medicaid players. Similar to certain effects the shift from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage has on SNFs, this shift towards more Managed Medicaid, while still early days, could have a significant effect on volumes, length of stay and payment rates.

In recent presentations, the Company has illustrated rent cut scenarios for the CCP portfolio.  We view this as an attempt to reassure shareholders that the portfolio can withstand a rent cut and the deal would still be modestly accretive to funds from operations ("FFO").  However, we believe the Company's analysis is deeply flawed, and that near-term accretion will turn into significant long-term earnings dilution:

Sabra is underestimating the risk – The Company's scenarios suggest that CCP may see a rent cut of approximately 5-10%.  In our view, the cut should reasonably be 20% or greater.   We believe Sabra management is overly focused on the near-term issues at Signature as the only major problem.  
We see no end in sight for the industry pressures.  We believe there will be continued pressure on rent over the next three-to-five years and, given CCP's poor relative positioning, its portfolio will witness trends that are at least as bad as what we predict for the industry.

Over the years, Sabra's management and board have done an admirable job recognizing the need to diversify the Company's portfolio and executed on this strategy.  In its 2016 proxy statement, the Company discussed this success as "achievements related to diversifying the investment portfolio."  In its first "highlight" supporting this demonstrated success, it reads "we further diversified our investment portfolio by tenant, asset class and geography."  In continuing to discuss further diversification success from its largest tenant, Genesis Healthcare Inc. ("Genesis"), Sabra goes on to say "upon completion of the [Genesis] sales, these asset sales and amendments will have the benefit of reducing our revenue concentration in Genesis and skilled nursing facilities…"  The proxy makes it very clear that the Company views asset class diversification as a clear success.  Yet despite this prudent strategy applauded by both shareholders and the board, management is unjustifiably reversing course by increasing its SNF exposure back to 73% (from 50%).  We have a very hard time understanding the rationale or motivation behind such a deal.  Two possible theories could be:

Sabra is extremely worried about its largest tenant, Genesis.  The Company is desperate to diversify away more quickly and/or plug the hole in FFO, and is obtuse to the fact that less exposure to Genesis does not make sense if its new exposure is even more problematic.  The belief that Sabra's cost of capital over the long-term will be lower if it diversifies is misguided because they are embarking on a flawed strategy of swapping one bad hand for one even worse. 
Acquiring CCP will increase Sabra's market cap by 2.4x.  Per the proxy, the Compensation Committee benchmarks management compensation against a list of companies that are of a similar size.  A material increase in the market cap would leapfrog Sabra into a peer group with a larger market cap and correspondingly higher range of compensation.

Given our views on the SNF industry and CCP in particular, we would have a very hard time justifying a price at which this deal makes sense.  We would, however, be remiss to not mention our view that the Company is significantly overpaying for this asset, even putting our strategic concerns aside.  Management has said that it paid an initial cap rate of 8.4%.  However, when adjusted for potential near-term rent cuts that re-base coverage merely to industry averages, that falls to the mid-7% range (per management).  Relative to the 9-11% range where we believe other SNF portfolios trade in the marketplace, Sabra is paying a huge premium.  
Finally, while this deal may be near-term accretive, we strongly believe it will be decidedly dilutive after larger rent adjustments and continued industry pressures.  As Sabra shareholders, we recommend that the Company take an alternative path – one similar to the previous strategy of diversifying away from large tenants, SNFs and government reimbursement, and we welcome the opportunity to discuss this further.
Sincerely,
Ricky C. Sandler  Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Investment Officer

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
