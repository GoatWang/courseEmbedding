NEW YORK, May 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders and intends to recommence the process for calling a Special Meeting of Depomed shareholders for removing and replacing the current Depomed Board of Directors with a modified slate of six highly qualified director nominees.
The full text of the letter follows:








May 26, 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard"), currently has an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  
We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders. Unfortunately, as we outlined in our previous letter to Depomed on April 8th, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed. We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.
To that end, we will be delivering to Depomed today a new written request, in accordance with Depomed's Bylaws, that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice") for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current Board. This Record Date Request Notice supersedes our initial request delivered to Depomed, dated April 7, 2016 (the "Initial Record Date Request Notice").  As you may recall, the Initial Record Date Request Notice was delivered to Depomed in order to preserve our rights under California law and mitigate the risk that Depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights.
Since delivering the Initial Record Date Request Notice, we have undertaken an extensive process to carefully vet a slate of highly-qualified nominees that included the evaluation of over 100 qualified potential candidates. We have selected a group of six candidates possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise. Collectively, our slate of director nominees has decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards. Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the special meeting, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.
We appreciate that the Board promptly set a record date in response to our Initial Record Date Request Notice, thereby demonstrating that it does not intend to unnecessarily delay the calling of a special meeting by shareholders. While we also appreciate the Board's intentions in amending its 10% poison pill rights plan ("Poison Pill") to facilitate our delivery of the requisite requests from shareholders in order to call the special meeting, there are other considerations as a 13D filer that make us uncomfortable with the idea of soliciting and delivering requests from other Depomed shareholders without conducting a public solicitation. Therefore, today we are filing preliminary proxy materials with the SEC in furtherance of soliciting the requisite requests to deliver the special meeting request. Our expectation is that the Board will adhere to a similar timetable in setting a record date for this Record Date Request Notice as it did with our Initial Record Date Request Notice, and we look forward to calling a special meeting of shareholders in the near future.
We are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly well-qualified to serve as directors of Depomed. We have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees below. Over the coming weeks and months, we intend to share our detailed views on Depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the special meeting of shareholders.

NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed") (NASDAQ:   DEPO), with beneficial ownership of approximately 9.8% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders.  Starboard also announced that as of this past Friday it has delivered to Depomed more than the required consents to call a Special Meeting of Depomed shareholders and has set November 15, 2016 as the date for the Special Meeting.  








The full text of Starboard's letter to Depomed shareholders follows:
September 19, 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard") and director nominees, currently owns approximately 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders. Unfortunately, a series of shareholder-unfriendly actions by the Board over the past two years have led us to conclude that management and the Board are not acting in the best interest of all shareholders. We therefore continue to believe it is necessary to make substantial changes to the composition of the Board as soon as possible so that steps can be taken to create value for the benefit of all shareholders.
As you may recall, we initiated the process to call a special meeting of shareholders (the "Special Meeting") on April 7, 2016 and, subsequently, on July 26, 2016, announced that we would proceed with a consent solicitation to call the Special Meeting by going through the procedures required for a shareholder to call a special meeting under Depomed's Bylaws by soliciting the support of the holders of at least 10% of Depomed's outstanding shares entitled to vote. As of Friday, we delivered to Depomed more than the required consents and have therefore initiated the calling of the Special Meeting to be held on November 15, 2016.  
We continue to have significant concerns that Depomed's Board is not looking out for the best interests of shareholders.  This was first evident during Horizon Pharma plc's ("Horizon") attempt to acquire the Company and was then reaffirmed by the Board's stealthy attempt to strip certain important shareholder rights earlier this year under the guise of a Delaware reincorporation proposal.  We have been steadfast that in light of these egregious actions, the Company clearly needs a new Board to ensure that shareholders' rights are properly and fully represented. 
Based on recent press reports, it appears that Depomed may have hired bankers to explore a sale.  As we have outlined publicly, we believe Depomed would be extremely attractive to numerous potential acquirers, and while there exists an opportunity to significantly improve operations at the Company, an outright sale may be the best option for unlocking shareholder value.  However, we remain extremely concerned that any potential sale process may not be undertaken with genuine intent, but rather as a smokescreen to distract from the required Board changes we are seeking and protect the current Board's positions beyond the Special Meeting.  We also do not trust the current Board to steward any sale process given the lengths the Board went to rebuff the approach by Horizon in 2015.  
Following the Board's mishandling of the Horizon acquisition proposal, it is imperative that any sale process be squarely focused on maximizing value for all shareholders.  Depomed refused to engage with Horizon despite its $33 per share offer at a 60% premium, and despite having expressed a willingness to raise the deal price. According to a proxy filing made by Horizon in November 2015, Horizon and its advisors reached out to Depomed to attempt to engage in acquisition discussions on more than 20 different occasions and not once did Depomed or its advisors meaningfully engage with Horizon. Instead, this Board not only avoided Horizon, but also unilaterally amended the Bylaws to make it extremely difficult for shareholders to have their voices heard on Horizon's offer, sued Horizon and adopted a Poison Pill. Is this the type of Board you can trust to conduct a robust sale process to maximize the value of your investment?
Unfortunately, according to recent press reports, the Company's actions regarding Horizon appear to be eerily similar to multiple other recent potential suitors who have reached out to try to engage with the Company on numerous occasions only to be rebuffed.  Clearly, the Company has a history of refusing to engage with potential suitors and not acting in the best interests of shareholders.  Press reports state that the Company has not yet begun a sale process but may do so in the future.  We have little confidence that the Company will begin a thorough and genuine process that includes all potential suitors in a manner designed to successfully maximize value for all shareholders.  Therefore, we believe that it is necessary for directors proposed by Starboard to be involved in any sale process at the Board level to ensure that the Board is actually and capably representing the best interests of shareholders and that value is maximized.
Record DateWe have been advised that Depomed has notified Broadridge Financial Solutions of a September 27, 2016 record date for the Special Meeting.  It is crucial that shareholders take whatever steps may be needed with their custodial banks and brokerage firms to ensure that they have the ability to vote their shares at the Special Meeting. 
It is important for shareholders to understand that while we firmly believe a change of the majority of the Board is warranted, we do not practically have any other option for seeking Board composition changes at the Special Meeting but to seek the removal of the entire Board.  This is because certain provisions under California law and the Company's Bylaws make it extremely difficult, if not virtually impossible, to remove any fewer than all of the Company's directors.  Effectively, if shareholders were to vote against the removal of even just one Depomed director at the Special Meeting, then a director-protecting cumulative voting provision is triggered with respect to every other director, thereby making the voting threshold required to remove any directors extraordinarily high and virtually impracticable.
In light of these unfortunate technical factors combined with the serious governance and operational deficiencies at Depomed, we intend to vigorously pursue replacement of the entire Board to ensure that Depomed is being run in a manner consistent with the best interests of all shareholders.  Over the coming weeks leading up to the Special Meeting we will be sharing additional details on our concerns regarding the serious corporate governance issues, questionable capital allocation decisions, and actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed.  We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of all shareholders.
As we progress towards the Special Meeting, we are extremely pleased to remind you of the highly qualified slate of candidates that we are proposing to be elected as the new Board of Depomed, including our highly qualified advisors who would be invited to join the new Board if we are successful.  We believe that we have selected a group of individuals possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise.  Collectively, our advisors and slate of director nominees have decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards.  Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the Special Meeting, together with our highly qualified advisors, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.  We have provided summary biographies of each of our nominees and advisors below.
ContinuityIn addition, in order to maintain a degree of continuity on the new Board, in the event that the current Board is removed and our nominees are elected at the Special Meeting, the new Board would be willing to increase the size of the Board to eleven members and add back up to three incumbent directors.  As a reminder, we utilized this construct successfully at Darden Restaurants where we replaced the entire board and then added back one of the prior board members.
We look forward to sharing additional details on our plans for Depomed and engaging with you over the coming weeks as we approach the Special Meeting.  As one of the largest shareholders of the Company, our interests are directly aligned with yours.  We firmly believe that our proposed changes are in the best interest of all shareholders.

Starboard Delivers Letter To Depomed ShareholdersHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Starboard Delivers Letter To Depomed ShareholdersPR NewswireJuly 26, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, July 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders. The full text of the letter follows:July 26, 2016Dear Fellow Shareholders,Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard") and director nominees, currently owns approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders.As we outlined in our May 26th letter to Depomed shareholders, we delivered a written request to Depomed, in accordance with its Bylaws, that the Board set a record date (the "Record Date Request Notice") for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting of shareholders (the "Special Meeting") for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current Board.  This Record Date Request Notice superseded our initial request delivered to Depomed, dated April 7, 2016 (the "Initial Record Date Request Notice").  As you may recall, the Initial Record Date Request Notice was delivered to Depomed in order to preserve our rights to call a special meeting under California law and mitigate the risk that Depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights.  Given the Board's disturbing history of taking actions aimed at limiting shareholder rights, we simply could not afford to take any risks.We continue to have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed.  We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.Following our initial evaluation of well over 100 qualified potential board candidates, we have continued to meet with numerous pharmaceutical executives to supplement our slate with additional pharmaceutical experience.  Unfortunately, given the extensive requirements and restrictions under the Depomed Bylaws for calling the Special Meeting, the addition of any new, highly qualified nominees to our slate at this time would effectively require us to submit a new record date request notice to Depomed, thereby restarting the clock under the Bylaws for the Special Meeting and further delaying our efforts to remove and replace the Board.  Further delay is unpalatable; therefore, we have instead appointed two exceptionally qualified former senior pharmaceutical executives – Robert G. Savage and James L. Tyree – as advisors to assist in our solicitation efforts given their significant industry knowledge and experience.  If our Special Meeting solicitation ultimately proves successful, we would invite Messrs. Savage and Tyree to join the Board, and they have indicated their desire to do so.As a brief background, Mr. Savage was the former Worldwide Chairman for the Pharmaceuticals Group at Johnson & Johnson where he was responsible for one of the world's largest pharmaceutical organizations with annual sales of almost $15 billion in 2001.  Mr. Tyree was the former Executive Vice President, Pharmaceutical Products at Abbott Laboratories with annual Pharmaceutical Products division sales of almost $20 billion in 2010.  We are confident that you will find Messrs. Savage and Tyree to be incredibly well-qualified to serve as directors of Depomed given their extensive experience as senior executives of multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical divisions at two of the world's largest and most well-respected healthcare companies.  They supplement what we already believe to be an exceptional slate of Board nominees who collectively possess a proven track record of corporate governance best practices and shareholder value creation.  We believe that, together, our advisors and current Board nominees would create an all-star Board that would work diligently and collaboratively to protect and represent the best interests of shareholders.Read MoreIn addition, in order to maintain a degree of continuity amidst the required change that we believe is desperately needed at Depomed, in the event that the current Board is removed and our nominees are elected at the Special Meeting, the new Board would be willing to increase the size of the Board to nine members (currently there are six members; adding Mr. Savage and Mr. Tyree would expand the Board to eight members) and add back one incumbent director.  As a reminder, we utilized this construct successfully at Darden Restaurants where we replaced the entire board and then added back one of the prior board members.Today, we are also announcing that we will proceed with our original solicitation to call the Special Meeting by going through the procedures required for a shareholder to call a special meeting under Depomed's Bylaws by soliciting the support of the holders of at least 10% of Depomed's outstanding shares entitled to vote.  The Company has set a record date of August 19, 2016 (the "Record Date"), for determining the shareholders entitled to provide their written request to call the Special Meeting.  Following the Record Date, Starboard will have up to 30 days to deliver the written requests to Depomed along with the other information required under the Bylaws, including the date Starboard would like to set for holding the Special Meeting (the "Special Meeting Notice"), which cannot be less than 35 nor more than 60 days after Starboard submits the Special Meeting Notice. Following Depomed's receipt of our Initial Record Date Request Notice on April 7, 2016, the Board responded promptly by setting a record date for April 26th, or less than three weeks later.  Depomed knew that our Initial Record Date Request Notice was a placeholder and that we would be revising our slate of nominees, which under Depomed's onerous Bylaw provisions, would require that we submit a new record date request notice.  On May 26, 2016, we delivered the new Record Date Request Notice with our updated Board slate.  However, in yet another sign of entrenchment, this time the Board responded by setting a record date of August 19, 2016, or close to three months later.  Shareholders should know that the Board delayed the record date to almost the full extent it is permitted to delay such an action under its Bylaws.  This is in stark contrast to the commentary from Depomed to shareholders on April 25, 2016:"Depomed believes that the selection of an early meeting date is in the best interest of Depomed and its shareholders.  Based upon Starboard's stated goals of making this an efficient process and its stated need to immediately bring to a vote the replacement of the entire Board, we encourage you and your advisors to work collaboratively with us to hold the Special Meeting as soon as possible."-          Jim SchoeneckApparently, when the Company realized that we had assembled a highly qualified slate, they no longer wished to hold the meeting as soon as possible.  This is yet another example of the Board attempting to disenfranchise shareholders and further entrench itself and bares an eerie resemblance to the delay tactics that Depomed used against Horizon Pharma plc ("Horizon") during Horizon's failed acquisition proposal of Depomed.  As you may recall, Depomed filed a lawsuit attempting to permanently enjoin Horizon from ever being able to acquire Depomed.We see the Board's rationale of basing the prolonged meeting date on the NUCYNTA litigation as a classic "bait-and-switch."  Upon our first placeholder nomination, there was no mention of delaying the Special Meeting until the outcome of the pending NUCYNTA patent litigation.  However, the most recent letter from Depomed to its shareholders details, "Depomed believes the Company's shareholders should know the outcome of the NUCYNTA patent litigation, clarifying the patent exclusivity of the Company's most important asset."  We believe that this stated reason for delaying the Special Meeting is completely disingenuous.Given our ownership stake, and that calling the Special Meeting would only require one shareholder to consent, we have decided, at this point, to control the timing of the Special Meeting.  We will proceed with our SEC-compliant solicitation process to ensure that shareholders have their voices heard and to prevent Depomed from any further attempts to manipulate our Special Meeting process and disenfranchise shareholders with needless stratagems.  We have concluded that this is the best course of action given our overwhelming lack of confidence that the Board will engage in a good-faith and expeditious manner.As we continue to progress towards the Special Meeting, we are extremely pleased to remind you of the highly qualified slate of candidates that we are proposing to be the new board of directors of Depomed, including our highly qualified advisors who would be added to the board if we are successful.  We believe that we have selected a group of individuals possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise.  Collectively, our advisors and slate of director nominees have decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards.  Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the Special Meeting, together with our highly qualified advisors, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and to ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.  We have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees and advisors below.  Over the coming weeks, we intend to share our detailed views on Depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the Special Meeting.Highlights of Starboard's Nominees' and Advisors' Biographies (in alphabetical order):John J.
