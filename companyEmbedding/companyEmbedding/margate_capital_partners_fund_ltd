Launches & Fundraising











Investment manager Ramius has partnered with Samantha Greenberg's newly-launched Margate Capital, a multi-sector equity long/short alternative asset manager. Ramius is providing seed capital to the new joint-venture.
Founded this year, Margate will pursue a fundamental long/short equity strategy emphasising catalysts and sector themes and will deploy a rules-based risk approach to protect capital and reduce volatility. Greenberg is the Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Margate, a woman-owned investment management business. Before she founded Margate, Greenberg served as partner and media/consumer sector head on the investment team of Paulson & Co Inc, where she managed equity investments in media, cable, consumer discretionary and staples sectors from 2009-16. Greenberg previously worked in Goldman Sachs’ Special Situations Group and at Chilton Investment Company investing in TMT and consumer industries. Greenberg has been named to the Hedge Fund Journal/Ernst & Young’s “50 Leading Women in Hedge Funds.” She holds an MBA from Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business and a BS in Economics, summa cum laude, with dual concentration in Finance and Strategic Management, from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
“We are excited to partner with Ramius, whose track record of successfully identifying and supporting emerging managers makes them the ideal strategic partner for Margate,” says Greenberg. “We are fortunate to benefit from Ramius’ expertise and capital, and our seasoned investment team looks forward to providing investors with our disciplined catalyst-focused absolute return strategy.”
Michael Singer, Chief Executive Officer of Ramius, says: "Samantha has proven herself an astute and skilled investor, and we believe her talents are well-suited to markets where alpha generation is in short supply. As Samantha's partner, we are committed to doing everything we can to build a successful business together. We believe that Samantha’s formidable investment skills and talents will benefit our institutional and high net worth clients worldwide."
Margate will initially manage proprietary capital for Cowen and will launch a commingled product in coming months.

Margate Capital Partners Fund Ltd SEC Filing Form D  4/2016, submited: 2016-10-07<< back to list of filingsForm DA filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.

View Margate Capital Partners Fund Ltd  4/2016 SEC Filing for free. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
