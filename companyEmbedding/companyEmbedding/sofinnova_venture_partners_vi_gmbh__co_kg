Sofinnova

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Sofinnova is the name shared by two venture capital firms, Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners. The name Sofinnova is believed to be a contraction of the French, "Société de Financement de l’Innovation" or, Innovation Venture Capital Company. Both firms trace their roots back to Sofinnova SA, an investment institution founded in Paris in 1972. The two firms have raised ~$4B since inception, and shared a similar investment strategy of investing in the life science and technology sectors. The two sister firms distinguish themselves on the basis of their target geographies, and have been fully independent since 1997.

Sofinnova Ventures has offices in Menlo Park, CA and San Diego, CA and focuses largely on US biotech investments, with ~20% allocation for Europe.
Sofinnova Partners is based in Paris and focuses primarily on European biotech and cleantech investments, with a similar reciprocal allocation for the US.

Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners have had historically some of the same Limited Partners, and have co-invested together in selected companies, including: Flamel, Cerep, Genset, Actelion, Preglem, Movetis, Ascendis, Obseva, Auris and Nucana. Both firms work together in a collegial way to exchange information and due diligence in each other's respective geographies. The firms do not have an obligation to show each other deals or to co-invest, but historically have co-invested together in ~10% of their collective investments.

Sofinnova Ventures is an independent venture capital firm based in Menlo Park with $1.9B capital under management.[1]
Investments[edit]
Sofinnova Ventures has been an active venture investor, investing in some well-known venture investments of the period.

Sofinnova Ventures closed their San Francisco office in 2011, and combined their Bay Area offices into a single office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park.
Sofinnova Ventures has raised several venture capital funds (see Table). The earlier funds, SVP I through V, were predominantly information technology (IT), wherein the later funds were predominantly life science focused. SVP VIII and IX were exclusively life science only, with emphasis on Phase 2 and 3 drug development. SVP IV was Sofinnova Ventures' initial fund after the reorganization of Sofinnova in 1997. Each of the funds from SVP V through SVP IX exceeded the target raise, and closed at the maximum amount as allowed by the Limited Partner agreements.

1970s: The Founding of Sofinnova[edit]

1972 - Sofinnova was founded with the backing of several French financial institutions (most notably Crédit National) and was notable at the time for creating the first "American style" venture capital firm in France. Peter Brooke, the founder of TA Associates, was a board member of Sofinnova SA in its early years. Sofinnova SA quickly established a presence in the European market through the formation of Sofinnova Partners in Paris. Sofinnova SA owned this firm from 1972 until 1997.
1974 - Sofinnova became the first European venture company to enter the US market launching its US affiliate, Sofinnova, Inc (Sofinnova Ventures). Sofinnova co-founder, Jean Deleage, who would later co-found US venture firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., was appointed the head of the US operation. Sofinnova's US business gained attention for its role as an early backer of Tandem Computers and Genentech in the early 1980s.
1976 - Sofinnova co-founder Jean Deleage established the American subsidiary of Sofinnova, called Sofinnova, Inc., in San Francisco, which eventually became Sofinnova Ventures. Deleage departed Sofinnova in 1979 to co-found another venture capital firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.. In 1981, working with Deleage, Sofinnova developed a partnership with Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. and ultimately other US firms. Jean-Bernard Schmidt, who would later serve as Chairman of Sofinnova, was named the head of US operations of Sofinnova, Inc.

1980s: The Early Growth of Sofinnova[edit]

1985 - Sofinnova completed an initial public offering with a listing on the Paris Stock Exchange.
1987 - Alain Azan moved to San Francisco to take over management of Sofinnova Ventures, replacing Jean-Bernard Schmidt. Schmidt would be named Chairman of Sofinnova, retaining that position through 2007. Sofinnova Ventures completed fundraising for SVP I, which was an private equity fund originally intended to invest in European companies expanding in the US. Ultimately, Sofinnova Venture Partners would shift its focus toward investments in domestic US companies.
1989 - Sofinnova Partners completed fundraising for Sofinnova Capital, its first private equity fund in France, with €38M of investor commitments. Sofinnova's investments in this fund include Genset Corporation as well as Cerep, Egide and Flamel.

1990s: The Reorganization of Sofinnova into Sofinnova Partners and Sofinnova Ventures[edit]

1993 - Sofinnova delisted itself from the Paris exchange to raise capital privately through traditional private equity funds. Prior to the 1997 reorganization, Sofinnova Ventures raised three venture funds totaling $57M, and Sofinnova Partners raised funds with €85M in commitments.
1997 - The global Sofinnova organization restructured, formally creating two separate management companies, one for Sofinnova Ventures, and one for Sofinnova Partners. The reorganization was done on the basis of geography, creating Sofinnova Ventures in the US and Sofinnova Partners in Europe. Following a management buyout, each of the management companies was solely owned by its respective management teams.

2000s: The Move to Life Science for Sofinnova[edit]

2000 - Sofinnova Ventures hires Jim Healy, MD, PhD and together he and Mike Powell, PhD rebuilt the Sofinnova Ventures LS brand, with focus on clinical stage drug development companies.
2003 - Sofinnova Ventures started its EIR/Executive Partner program in Life Sciences, with its first EIR Barry Selick. Following this, several other EIRs/Executive Partners joined Sofinnova Ventures from then until 2015, including: Jeff Stein, David Kabakoff, Bill Ringo (Strategic Advisor), Goro Takeda, Jay Shepard, George Horner, Lars Ekman and Dan Welch.
2006 - Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners first sponsored the Sofinnova Biopharm Partnering Conference in Japan, headed up by Sofinnova's Goro Takeda. In 2014, the conference teamed up with Biotechnology Industry Organization, making this the largest biopartnering meeting in Japan.
2007 - SVP VII was raised, which was Sofinnova Ventures' first fund that was overwhelmingly focused on Life Science (80%+), with emphasis on drug development. Their next fund, SVP VIII in 2011 was exclusively (100%) Life Science. At the same time, Sofinnova Partners in Paris moved from a balanced IT/LS venture firm, to one that was predominantly focused on Life Science.
2008 - Sofinnova Ventures made its last IT investment (Enovix). The remaining IT team was active for several years after this to monitor and monetize the final IT investments.

2010s: New Growth Initiatives at Sofinnova[edit]

2010 - Sofinnova Partners started their Green Seed Fund and hired Joško Bobanović to manage this new initiative. In 2012, this seed fund initiative was announced in conjunction with the Sofinnova Capital VII announcement.
2013 - Sofinnova Ventures worked with General Partner Garheng Kong to spin out a new fund, called HealthQuest Capital. HQC's mandate is to provide growth capital to companies transforming healthcare, with a focus on companies other than drug development. HQC raised their second fund, at $225M, in 2016, and transitioned to further independence from the parent Sofinnova Ventures organization.
2017 - Sofinnova Partners announced the first closing of Sofinnova Industrial Biotech I, at €106 million. The fund, dedicated to renewable chemistry, follows a series of 9 investments in the sector since 2009. It will leverage an experienced and dedicated team, initially composed of Denis Lucquin, Managing Partner, Joško Bobanović, Partner, Michael Krel, Principal and Guillaume Baxter, Senior Associate.

About Us
Founded in 1974, Sofinnova is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical venture capital firm with approximately $2.2B under management. We are a passionate and committed team of MDs and PhDs that deploy human and financial capital to improve the lives of patients through science. Our mission is to provide industry leading venture returns by delivering transformative medicines to patients. We live our mission to deliver outstanding results for those we serve – patients, entrepreneurs, and the people and organizations that entrust us with their capital.
Sofinnova specializes in clinical and late preclinical investments in biopharmaceutical products. We actively partner with entrepreneurs across all stages of company formation including securing initial funding, building successful management teams, forming impactful corporate alliances, and navigating the M&A acquisition or IPOs' process. We seek to build world class companies that aspire to dramatically improve the current state of medical care today and ultimately, the lives of patients.

The History of Sofinnova Ventures
Sofinnova represents decades of active venture investing in Silicon Valley.  Our original French parent firm, Sofinnova SA, was founded in Paris in 1972, and has the distinction of being one of the earliest venture capital firms in Europe. Sofinnova moved into the US in 1974, to build a Trans-Atlantic US-EU connection.  Jean Deleage was the first President and Founder of the US arm of Sofinnova.  Sofinnova SA had great success in the US, being an early investor in stellar companies such as Tandem Computers and Genentech.
 Sofinnova SA initiated a new family of US venture funds in 1984, aptly described as Sofinnova Venture Partners I, II, III and more. Sofinnova invested the first three of these funds in primarily information technology, and was known as a ‘boutique French VC firm’ until the late 90s.  Each of these US Sofinnova funds were raised, invested and managed independently from the funds managed and invested by Sofinnova in Paris, and both partnerships continued to be owned by Sofinnova SA until the late 90s.
 In 1997 Sofinnova restructured into two independent management firms, Sofinnova Partners in Paris, and Sofinnova Ventures in San Francisco. Each firm became an independent venture capital firm with independent funds, investment strategies and partnerships. It was the vision of the partners in 1997 that each of the firms should be owned by the partners doing the investing, allowing the carried interest profits to remain with the investing professionals, aligning their interests with the Limited Partners who invest in the funds.  That said, the sister firms share deal flow, expertise and due diligence information, as well as invest together selectively on a case-by-case basis.
 Since 2007, Sofinnova Ventures has been almost exclusively life science focused, and its two most recent funds, SVP VIII and SVP IX, are exclusively life science.   Their biotech focus is on drug development, mostly later stage, with an emphasis on specialty pharma, orphan drugs and rare diseases.  Key therapeutic areas include: oncology, respiratory, neuro, dermatology, and areas where a primary sales force is not needed. Sofinnova Ventures has a long track record of working closely with entrepreneurs to build leading biotech companies.
 A more detailed history of the global Sofinnova organization can be found here.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Sofinnova is the name shared by two venture capital firms, Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners. The name Sofinnova is believed to be a contraction of the French, "Société de Financement de l’Innovation" or, Innovation Venture Capital Company. Both firms trace their roots back to Sofinnova SA, an investment institution founded in Paris in 1972. The two firms have raised ~$4B since inception, and shared a similar investment strategy of investing in the life science and technology sectors. The two sister firms distinguish themselves on the basis of their target geographies, and have been fully independent since 1997.

Sofinnova Ventures has offices in Menlo Park, CA and San Diego, CA and focuses largely on US biotech investments, with ~20% allocation for Europe.
Sofinnova Partners is based in Paris and focuses primarily on European biotech and cleantech investments, with a similar reciprocal allocation for the US.

Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners have had historically some of the same Limited Partners, and have co-invested together in selected companies, including: Flamel, Cerep, Genset, Actelion, Preglem, Movetis, Ascendis, Obseva, Auris and Nucana. Both firms work together in a collegial way to exchange information and due diligence in each other's respective geographies. The firms do not have an obligation to show each other deals or to co-invest, but historically have co-invested together in ~10% of their collective investments.

Sofinnova Ventures has raised several venture capital funds (see Table). The earlier funds, SVP I through V, were predominantly information technology (IT), wherein the later funds were predominantly life science focused. SVP VIII and IX were exclusively life science only, with emphasis on Phase 2 and 3 drug development. SVP IV was Sofinnova Ventures' initial fund after the reorganization of Sofinnova in 1997. Each of the funds from SVP V through SVP IX exceeded the target raise, and closed at the maximum amount as allowed by the Limited Partner agreements.

1970s: The Founding of Sofinnova[edit]

1972 - Sofinnova was founded with the backing of several French financial institutions (most notably Crédit National) and was notable at the time for creating the first "American style" venture capital firm in France. Peter Brooke, the founder of TA Associates, was a board member of Sofinnova SA in its early years. Sofinnova SA quickly established a presence in the European market through the formation of Sofinnova Partners in Paris. Sofinnova SA owned this firm from 1972 until 1997.
1974 - Sofinnova became the first European venture company to enter the US market launching its US affiliate, Sofinnova, Inc (Sofinnova Ventures). Sofinnova co-founder, Jean Deleage, who would later co-found US venture firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., was appointed the head of the US operation. Sofinnova's US business gained attention for its role as an early backer of Tandem Computers and Genentech in the early 1980s.
1976 - Sofinnova co-founder Jean Deleage established the American subsidiary of Sofinnova, called Sofinnova, Inc., in San Francisco, which eventually became Sofinnova Ventures. Deleage departed Sofinnova in 1979 to co-found another venture capital firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.. In 1981, working with Deleage, Sofinnova developed a partnership with Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. and ultimately other US firms. Jean-Bernard Schmidt, who would later serve as Chairman of Sofinnova, was named the head of US operations of Sofinnova, Inc.

1980s: The Early Growth of Sofinnova[edit]

1985 - Sofinnova completed an initial public offering with a listing on the Paris Stock Exchange.
1987 - Alain Azan moved to San Francisco to take over management of Sofinnova Ventures, replacing Jean-Bernard Schmidt. Schmidt would be named Chairman of Sofinnova, retaining that position through 2007. Sofinnova Ventures completed fundraising for SVP I, which was an private equity fund originally intended to invest in European companies expanding in the US. Ultimately, Sofinnova Venture Partners would shift its focus toward investments in domestic US companies.
1989 - Sofinnova Partners completed fundraising for Sofinnova Capital, its first private equity fund in France, with €38M of investor commitments. Sofinnova's investments in this fund include Genset Corporation as well as Cerep, Egide and Flamel.

1990s: The Reorganization of Sofinnova into Sofinnova Partners and Sofinnova Ventures[edit]

1993 - Sofinnova delisted itself from the Paris exchange to raise capital privately through traditional private equity funds. Prior to the 1997 reorganization, Sofinnova Ventures raised three venture funds totaling $57M, and Sofinnova Partners raised funds with €85M in commitments.
1997 - The global Sofinnova organization restructured, formally creating two separate management companies, one for Sofinnova Ventures, and one for Sofinnova Partners. The reorganization was done on the basis of geography, creating Sofinnova Ventures in the US and Sofinnova Partners in Europe. Following a management buyout, each of the management companies was solely owned by its respective management teams.

2000s: The Move to Life Science for Sofinnova[edit]

2000 - Sofinnova Ventures hires Jim Healy, MD, PhD and together he and Mike Powell, PhD rebuilt the Sofinnova Ventures LS brand, with focus on clinical stage drug development companies.
2003 - Sofinnova Ventures started its EIR/Executive Partner program in Life Sciences, with its first EIR Barry Selick. Following this, several other EIRs/Executive Partners joined Sofinnova Ventures from then until 2015, including: Jeff Stein, David Kabakoff, Bill Ringo (Strategic Advisor), Goro Takeda, Jay Shepard, George Horner, Lars Ekman and Dan Welch.
2006 - Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners first sponsored the Sofinnova Biopharm Partnering Conference in Japan, headed up by Sofinnova's Goro Takeda. In 2014, the conference teamed up with Biotechnology Industry Organization, making this the largest biopartnering meeting in Japan.
2007 - SVP VII was raised, which was Sofinnova Ventures' first fund that was overwhelmingly focused on Life Science (80%+), with emphasis on drug development. Their next fund, SVP VIII in 2011 was exclusively (100%) Life Science. At the same time, Sofinnova Partners in Paris moved from a balanced IT/LS venture firm, to one that was predominantly focused on Life Science.
2008 - Sofinnova Ventures made its last IT investment (Enovix). The remaining IT team was active for several years after this to monitor and monetize the final IT investments.

2010s: New Growth Initiatives at Sofinnova[edit]

2010 - Sofinnova Partners started their Green Seed Fund and hired Joško Bobanović to manage this new initiative. In 2012, this seed fund initiative was announced in conjunction with the Sofinnova Capital VII announcement.
2013 - Sofinnova Ventures worked with General Partner Garheng Kong to spin out a new fund, called HealthQuest Capital. HQC's mandate is to provide growth capital to companies transforming healthcare, with a focus on companies other than drug development. HQC raised their second fund, at $225M, in 2016, and transitioned to further independence from the parent Sofinnova Ventures organization.
2017 - Sofinnova Partners announced the first closing of Sofinnova Industrial Biotech I, at €106 million. The fund, dedicated to renewable chemistry, follows a series of 9 investments in the sector since 2009. It will leverage an experienced and dedicated team, initially composed of Denis Lucquin, Managing Partner, Joško Bobanović, Partner, Michael Krel, Principal and Guillaume Baxter, Senior Associate.

Sofinnova invested in Collagen Aesthetics, Biogen, Genentech, Tandon, Tandem Computers and Printonix, Tumbleweed, and Phone.com. Sofinnova Ventures funded several of these as start-ups that developed into large international companies. More recently, Sofinnova Ventures has backed companies including: Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Kosan Biosciences, Actelion, Intermune, Seattle Genetics, Cotherix, Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Prestwick, Preglem, Movetis, Intellikine, Amarin Corporation, Salveo, and Labrys.
The San Francisco office of Sofinnova Ventures was often remembered for having an original 18 ft. mosasaurus in the office of one of the Managing Partners (Mike Powell). Sofinnova Ventures closed their San Francisco office in 2011, and combined their Bay Area offices into a single office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park.
Sofinnova Ventures has raised several venture capital funds (see Table). The earlier funds, SVP I through V, were predominantly information technology (IT), wherein the later funds were predominantly life science focused. SVP VIII and IX were exclusively life science only, with emphasis on Phase 2 and 3 drug development. SVP IV was Sofinnova Ventures' initial fund after the reorganization of Sofinnova in 1997. Each of the funds from SVP V through SVP IX exceeded the target raise, and closed at the maximum amount as allowed by the Limited Partner agreements.

1970s: The Founding of Sofinnova[edit]

1972 - Sofinnova was founded with the backing of several French financial institutions (most notably Crédit National) and was notable at the time for creating the first "American style" venture capital firm in France. Peter Brooke, the founder of TA Associates, was a board member of Sofinnova SA in its early years. Sofinnova SA quickly established a presence in the European market through the formation of Sofinnova Partners in Paris. Sofinnova SA owned this firm from 1972 until 1997.
1974 - Sofinnova became the first European venture company to enter the US market launching its US affiliate, Sofinnova, Inc (Sofinnova Ventures). Sofinnova co-founder, Jean Deleage, who would later co-found US venture firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., was appointed the head of the US operation. Sofinnova's US business gained attention for its role as an early backer of Tandem Computers and Genentech in the early 1980s.
1976 - Sofinnova co-founder Jean Deleage established the American subsidiary of Sofinnova, called Sofinnova, Inc., in San Francisco, which eventually became Sofinnova Ventures. Deleage departed Sofinnova in 1979 to co-found another venture capital firm Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co.. In 1981, working with Deleage, Sofinnova developed a partnership with Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co. and ultimately other US firms. Jean-Bernard Schmidt, who would later serve as Chairman of Sofinnova, was named the head of US operations of Sofinnova, Inc.

1980s: The Early Growth of Sofinnova[edit]

1985 - Sofinnova completed an initial public offering with a listing on the Paris Stock Exchange.
1987 - Alain Azan moved to San Francisco to take over management of Sofinnova Ventures, replacing Jean-Bernard Schmidt. Schmidt would be named Chairman of Sofinnova, retaining that position through 2007. Sofinnova Ventures completed fundraising for SVP I, which was an private equity fund originally intended to invest in European companies expanding in the US. Ultimately, Sofinnova Venture Partners would shift its focus toward investments in domestic US companies.
1989 - Sofinnova Partners completed fundraising for Sofinnova Capital, its first private equity fund in France, with €38M of investor commitments. Sofinnova's investments in this fund include Genset Corporation as well as Cerep, Egide and Flamel.

1990s: The Reorganization of Sofinnova into Sofinnova Partners and Sofinnova Ventures[edit]

1993 - Sofinnova delisted itself from the Paris exchange to raise capital privately through traditional private equity funds. Prior to the 1997 reorganization, Sofinnova Ventures raised three venture funds totaling $57M, and Sofinnova Partners raised funds with €85M in commitments.
1997 - The global Sofinnova organization restructured, formally creating two separate management companies, one for Sofinnova Ventures, and one for Sofinnova Partners. The reorganization was done on the basis of geography, creating Sofinnova Ventures in the US and Sofinnova Partners in Europe. Following a management buyout, each of the management companies was solely owned by its respective management teams.

2000s: The Move to Life Science for Sofinnova[edit]

2000 - Sofinnova Ventures hires Jim Healy, MD, PhD and together he and Mike Powell, PhD rebuilt the Sofinnova Ventures LS brand, with focus on clinical stage drug development companies.
2003 - Sofinnova Ventures started its EIR/Executive Partner program in Life Sciences, with its first EIR Barry Selick. Following this, several other EIRs/Executive Partners joined Sofinnova Ventures from then until 2015, including: Jeff Stein, David Kabakoff, Bill Ringo (Strategic Advisor), Goro Takeda, Jay Shepard, George Horner, Lars Ekman and Dan Welch.
2006 - Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners first sponsored the Sofinnova Biopharm Partnering Conference in Japan, headed up by Sofinnova's Goro Takeda. In 2014, the conference teamed up with Biotechnology Industry Organization, making this the largest biopartnering meeting in Japan.
2007 - SVP VII was raised, which was Sofinnova Ventures' first fund that was overwhelmingly focused on Life Science (80%+), with emphasis on drug development. Their next fund, SVP VIII in 2011 was exclusively (100%) Life Science. At the same time, Sofinnova Partners in Paris moved from a balanced IT/LS venture firm, to one that was predominantly focused on Life Science.
2008 - Sofinnova Ventures made its last IT investment (Enovix). The remaining IT team was active for several years after this to monitor and monetize the final IT investments.

2010s: New Growth Initiatives at Sofinnova[edit]

2010 - Sofinnova Partners started their Green Seed Fund and hired Joško Bobanović to manage this new initiative. In 2012, this seed fund initiative was announced in conjunction with the Sofinnova Capital VII announcement.
2013 - Sofinnova Ventures worked with General Partner Garheng Kong to spin out a new fund, called HealthQuest Capital. HQC's mandate is to provide growth capital to companies transforming healthcare, with a focus on companies other than drug development. HQC raised their second fund, at $225M, in 2016, and transitioned to further independence from the parent Sofinnova Ventures organization.
2017 - Sofinnova Partners announced the first closing of Sofinnova Industrial Biotech I, at €106 million. The fund, dedicated to renewable chemistry, follows a series of 9 investments in the sector since 2009. It will leverage an experienced and dedicated team, initially composed of Denis Lucquin, Managing Partner, Joško Bobanović, Partner, Michael Krel, Principal and Guillaume Baxter, Senior Associate.

Sofinnova - Wikipedia





















 






Sofinnova

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search


Sofinnova is the name shared by two venture capital firms, Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners. The name Sofinnova is believed to be a contraction of the French, "Société de Financement de l’Innovation" or, Innovation Venture Capital Company. Both firms trace their roots back to Sofinnova SA, an investment institution founded in Paris in 1972. The two firms have raised ~$4B since inception, and shared a similar investment strategy of investing in the life science and technology sectors. The two sister firms distinguish themselves on the basis of their target geographies, and have been fully independent since 1997.

Sofinnova Ventures has offices in Menlo Park, CA and San Diego, CA and focuses largely on US biotech investments, with ~20% allocation for Europe.
Sofinnova Partners is based in Paris and focuses primarily on European biotech and cleantech investments, with a similar reciprocal allocation for the US.

Sofinnova Ventures and Sofinnova Partners have had historically some of the same Limited Partners, and have co-invested together in selected companies, including: Flamel, Cerep, Genset, Actelion, Preglem, Movetis, Ascendis, Obseva, Auris and Nucana. Both firms work together in a collegial way to exchange information and due diligence in each other's respective geographies. The firms do not have an obligation to show each other deals or to co-invest, but historically have co-invested together in ~10% of their collective investments.

Rodman, MD as Chief Development Strategy Officer LEIDEN, the Netherlands, March 27, 2017 – ProQR Therapeutics N.V. (Nasdaq:PRQR) today announced that it appointed David M. Rodman, MD as Chief Development Strategy Officer. Dr. Rodman has had a long career in drug development including leadership roles in translational medicine, rare disease drug development, and RNA therapeutics. Dr. Rodman’s experience includes a leadership role in developing two approved medicines for cystic fibrosis (CF) at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, as vice president and head of respiratory drug development. He was also the head of translational medicine at Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research. More recently, he was the Chief Medical Officer at MiRagen and Nivalis. Expansion of the ProQR management team will allow the company to unlock the potential of RNA therapeutics as well as expand business capabilities needed to advance the development of our product candidates that now include three programs: QR-010 for CF, QR-110 for Leber’s congenital amaurosis Type 10, and QR-313 for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.“At ProQR we are just beginning to capitalize on the power of RNA based therapeutics. We believe RNA therapeutics offers a powerful therapeutic approach to severe genetic disease. We believe the RNA approach has advantages over other approaches, and we are excited to fully explore the possibilities for patients. By adding Dave to our leadership, we will be able to strengthen our portfolio and strategically build our pipeline of RNA approaches to treating disease.” said Noreen R. Henig, MD, Chief Medical Officer.“There are very few opportunities like ProQR where a great team, cutting edge science and the passion for patients come together” said David M. Rodman, MD, “In joining ProQR I look forward to continue to make an effort for CF patients, but also on making a big impact for patients suffering from other rare diseases.”“In the ProQR tradition of only working with the best of the best, I’m very pleased that Dave is joining our team” said Daniel de Boer, Chief Executive Officer of ProQR. “Between Gerard (Platenburg, Chief Innovation Officer), Dave and Noreen we cover all key capabilities from invention to translation to late stage development.”About ProQR ProQR Therapeutics is dedicated to changing lives through the creation of transformative RNA medicines for the treatment of severe genetic rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Leber’s congenital amaurosis Type 10 and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Based on our unique proprietary RNA repair platform technologies we are growing our pipeline with patients and loved ones in mind. *Since 2012*About Cystic Fibrosis CF is the most common fatal inherited disease in the Western world and affects an estimated 65,000 patients worldwide. In people with CF, a defective CFTR gene causes a thick, buildup of mucus in the lungs, pancreas and other organs. In the lungs, the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections, extensive lung damage and eventually, respiratory failure. There is no cure for CF. Disease manifestations lead to a shortened life expectancy with a median age of death of 30 years or less. Although over 1,900 CF-causing gene mutations have been identified, approximately 85% of all CF patients are affected by the F508del mutation. Among all CF patients, approximately 45% are homozygous for the F508del mutation.About Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis Type 10 Leber’s congenital amaurosis is the most common genetic cause of blindness in children and consists of a group of diseases of which LCA Type 10 (LCA 10) is one of the more severe forms. LCA 10 leads to progressive loss of vision causing most patients to lose their sight in the first few years of life. To date, there are no treatments approved or product candidates in clinical development that treat the underlying cause of this specific subtype of the disease. LCA 10 is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene of which the p.Cys998X mutation is most common. Although prevalence rates vary, we believe approximately 2,000 people in the Western world have LCA 10 because of this mutation.About Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a rare genetic disorder of the skin and mucosal membranes and is characterized by fragile skin, severe blistering and poorly healing wounds that result from minimal pressure. Some forms of DEB are painful and debilitating and are associated with very low quality of life and a limited life expectancy. The disease is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that lead to a weak connection between the dermis (inner layer) and the epidermis (outer layer) in the skin. Approximately 2,000 patients have DEB because of mutations in exon 73 of the COL7A1 gene. There is currently no treatment available.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements.

The study is being conducted in 10 European countries. Nolasiban is an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist that potentially improves pregnancy and live birth rates following embryo transfer (ET). In a completed Phase 2 study, 43 percent of patients treated with 900 mg of nolasiban before ET achieved a live birth compared to 29 percent of patients who received placebo. “Based on our promising Phase 2 data, we are starting a large confirmatory study to assess the efficacy and safety of a single, oral administration of 900 mg of nolasiban before embryo transfer on either Day 3 or Day 5 following egg retrieval,” said Ernest Loumaye, MD, PhD, OB&GYN, CEO and Co-Founder of ObsEva. “We believe that should this trial confirm an absolute increase in live birth rates of about 10 percent, or greater, it would represent a major advance for the patients undergoing these demanding procedures to fulfill their desire to have a child.” The IMPLANT2 clinical trial is being conducted at approximately 50 fertility clinics across Europe, and is expected to enroll about 760 women who are undergoing assisted reproduction by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for low fertility. Following ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval and fertilization, eligible women will be randomized to receive either a single oral dose of 900 mg nolasiban or placebo a few hours before Day 3 or Day 5 ET. Treatment allocation will be blinded. A pregnancy test will be done after two weeks and pregnancies confirmed by ultrasound at 6 and 10 weeks. The primary outcome is ongoing pregnancy at 10 weeks after ET. Women with confirmed pregnancies will be monitored until the birth of their babies. Babies will be monitored for one to six months after birth.About Assisted Reproductive Technology Infertility affects about 10 percent of reproductive-aged couples, with approximately 1.6 million ART treatments (including IVF and ICSI) performed worldwide each year. While the success of ART depends on multiple factors such as embryo quality and ET procedure, a successful pregnancy ultimately hinges on the receptivity of the uterus to accept embryo implantation. Uterine contractions at the time of ET, as well as suboptimal thickness of the uterine wall and blood flow to the uterus, may impair the implantation of the embryo.About Nolasiban Nolasiban (previously known as OBE001), is an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist with the potential to decrease contractions, improve uterine blood flow and enhance the receptivity of the endometrium to embryo implantation, all of which may increase the chance of successful pregnancy and live-birth among patients undergoing ART. ObsEva licensed nolasiban from Merck-Serono in 2013 and retains worldwide commercial rights.About ObsEva ObsEva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the clinical development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman’s reproductive health and pregnancy. Through strategic in-licensing and disciplined drug development, ObsEva has established a late-stage clinical pipeline with development programs focused on treating endometriosis, uterine fibroids, preterm labor and improving ART outcomes.

Gimv and Sofinnova Partners co-led the round and were joined by Gilde Healthcare. PARI Pharma supports the program. With the proceeds from the financing, Breath Therapeutics plans to conduct phase 3 trials in Europe and the US, respectively, submit for marketing approval, and prepare for commercialization. Breath Therapeutics’ lead program develops a first-in-class inhalation therapy for treatment of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS). BOS is a lethal orphan respiratory disease, mainly affecting lung transplant patients. It is commonly understood as chronic graft rejection and is the main reason for the poor 5-year survival rates after lung transplantation. Based on work by PARI Pharma and lung transplantation expert Aldo Iacono, MD, University of Maryland, USA, Breath Therapeutics develops a proprietary drug/device combination. This involves a formulation of liposomal cyclosporine A for inhalation and an optimized high performance eFlow® technology nebulizer enabling remote adherence monitoring. This approach is expected to ensure a safe, well tolerated and targeted delivery of immunosuppressive medication directly into the lungs along with a time saving treatment regime. Breath Therapeutics is a spin-off of PARI Pharma, Starnberg, Germany. The company’s founding and management team includes highly experienced executives and internationally renowned experts in drug aerosol and immunosuppression therapy: Dr. Jens Stegemann (CEO), Anne Burger (CFO), Dr. Gerhard Boerner (CSO) and Dr. Oliver Denk (COO). Graziano Seghezzi, partner at Sofinnova Partners, Dr. Karl Nägler, partner at Gimv, and Arthur Franken, partner at Gilde Healthcare, will join the board of directors. Dr. Jens Stegemann, CEO of Breath Therapeutics, said: “BOS is one of the most devastating lung diseases and still today, no effective therapy is available. Our strategy is to deposit high concentrations of an immunosuppressive agent directly into the small airways of the lung. With this top-tier group of investors and the best international lung transplantation centres supporting us, we now are in an excellent position to achieve ground-breaking improvements in the combat of BOS.” Graziano Seghezzi, partner at Sofinnova Partners, added: “We are thrilled to be involved with Breath Therapeutics. We were really impressed by its highly talented and entrepreneur-oriented team, as well as by the potential of its market breaking technology. At Sofinnova Partners we have a strong expertise in turning corporate spin-offs into successful companies, and are happy to share our experience and resources with the team to back Breath Therapeutics’ growth.” Dr. Karl Nägler, partner at Gimv, commented: “It is a great opportunity to invest in a company focusing on a life-threatening orphan disease with high unmet medical need. We were attracted by the strong expertise of the founding team and by the very promising late-stage clinical data. Furthermore, the BOS market will allow for a focused and highly profitable commercialisation strategy.” Arthur Franken, partner at Gilde Healthcare, said: “This talented team has designed a unique drug/device combination which together with digital adherence monitoring has great potential to improve quality of care for patients suffering from chronic lung graft rejection. Gilde will actively support Breath Therapeutics and its team in its growth strategy of developing and commercializing inhaled drug therapies for severe respiratory disease.” Dr. Martin Knoch, President of PARI Pharma, said: “The team at Breath Therapeutics has the expertise and focus to bring the first lung-targeted BOS therapy through clinical development and hopefully onto the market. For PARI Pharma it is highly rewarding to see a project that we started advancing into late-stage clinical development and providing BOS patients new hope.”About Breath Therapeutics Breath Therapeutics is specializing in advanced and first-in-class inhalation therapies for severe respiratory diseases.

It’s an exciting time to join the Hookipa team and I am very eager to share my experience in drug development to further its mission to help patients.” About Hookipa Biotech Hookipa Biotech is developing next-generation immunotherapies for infectious diseases and cancer using novel proprietary arenavirus vector platforms. To date, Hookipa has raised EUR 13.7 million in non-dilutive funds and EUR 37 million equity investment from internationally renowned venture capital investors including Sofinnova Partners, Forbion Capital Partners, Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund, Takeda Ventures and BioMedPartners. Additional information on Hookipa is available at www.hookipabiotech.com.About Vaxwave® Hookipa’s Vaxwave® technology presents a completely new replication-defective viral vector platform designed to overcome the limitations of current technologies. In this vector the gene encoding the viral envelope protein, normally responsible for virus entry into target cells, has been deleted and replaced with a target gene “of interest.” The resulting vectors infect target cells and stimulate very potent and long-lasting immune responses, however they can no longer replicate and are therefore non-pathogenic and inherently safe. HB-101, a cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylactic vaccine, is in a clinical phase 1 trial and has already shown to be both safe in humans and to elicit potent antibody and T cell responses. We are confident to establish HB-101 as the best-in class CMV development program. About TheraT® Hookipa’s TheraT® platform is based on an attenuated replicating virus and is capable of eliciting the most potent T cell responses – a crucial step in treating patients with aggressive cancers. Significant pre-clinical data demonstrates that TheraT® is a powerful modality capable of turning “cold tumors hot” which should result in an additional layer of efficacy in the fight against solid tumors. Specifically, TheraT® has proven to be safe in animals as well as capable of eliciting > 50% antigen-specific T cell responses and strong tumor control in mice. The first clinical trial with HB-201 targeting human papilloma virus-induced head and neck cancer is currently being prepared. This immuno-oncology technology is further being leveraged to target tumor self-antigens or shared neoantigens.Issued for and on behalf Hookipa Biotech AG by Instinctif Partners.

Current investor Sofinnova Partners and new investor Bioindustrial Innovation Canada (BIC) also participated in the financing. Terms of the financing were not disclosed.Comet’s industrial technology converts agricultural residues into high-purity dextrose for production of sustainable bio-chemicals. Comet’s cellulosic sugar is not only cost- and quality-competitive with corn or sugarcane derived products, but importantly, it does not hamper food production and has a superior carbon footprint, improving the sustainability profile of the produced biochemical. The investment will be used to advance the commercialization of Comet’s secondgeneration sugar production platform and fund construction of the company’s previously announced 60 million pounds per year dextrose facility in Sarnia, Ontario.“We are very pleased to announce this new round of financing, with strong support from Sofinnova Partners and our new investors. The investment reflects confidence in our low-cost, high-purity cellulosic dextrose technology and enables us to deliver on a key missing piece in the value chain – a viable source of renewable sugars from non-food biomass,” said Rich Troyer, CEO of Comet.Joško Bobanović of Sofinnova Partners commented, “We look forward to supporting the Comet management team as they take the company and the technology to the next level. Comet’s project is now well-positioned to enable profitable production of truly commercial quantities of second-generation sugars and co-products for bio-based applications.”In March 2016, with strong support of BIC, Comet Biorefining partnered with the Cellulosic Sugar Producers Cooperative located in Western Ontario. The Ontario farmer group plans to invest in and supply corn stover and wheat straw feedstock to Comet’s commercial plant. Sandy Marshall, Executive Director of BIC noted that “The recent investment allows us to continue to support Comet Biorefining’s mission to integrate regional supply chains with innovative new technology partners and enable Sarnia-Lambton to become a leader in the development of sustainable, bio-based products.”About Comet Biorefining Comet Biorefining is a leading provider of sustainable, high-quality, costcompetitive cellulosic dextrose technology for applications in renewable biochemicals and biofuels.

USA —February 21st, 2017—Lysogene, (the “Company” FR0013233475 – LYS) a leading, clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in gene therapy for rare central nervous system diseases, today announces that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted orphan drug designation to LYS-GM101, the Company’s gene therapy drug candidate for treatment of GM1 Gangliosidosis (GM1). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also granted an orphan drug designation and a rare pediatric disease designation to LYS-GM101 earlier this year. “The EMA Orphan Drug Designation for LYS-GM101 is a key regulatory milestone further validating the medical plausibility of our approach,” stated Karen Aiach, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Lysogene. “This designation will further facilitate and accelerate clinical development of our treatment. It is good news for patients suffering from this severe neurodegenerative disease and we look forward to studying this therapy further as we approach our upcoming Phase I/II clinical trial (LYS-GM101) in 2018.” LYS-GM101 is designed to replace a defective gene in the cells of GM1 patients, in order to allow for production of the functional enzyme and to prevent the progressive nature of the neurological damage caused by GM1 in humans. About the Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) An ODD by the EMA allows a pharmaceutical company to benefit from incentives from the EU to develop a medicine for a rare disease. Applications for ODD are examined by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), which adopts an opinion that is forwarded to the European Commission (EC). The EC then decides whether to grant an orphan designation for the medicine in question within 30 days of receipt of the COMP opinion. Pharmaceutical companies that obtain ODD benefit from a number of incentives, including protocol assistance, a type of scientific advice specific for designated orphan medicines, and market exclusivity once the medicine is on the market. Fee reductions are also available, depending on the status of the sponsor and the type of service requiredAbout GM1 GM1 is an extremely severe, autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in the GLB1 gene encoding for the lysosomal acid beta-balactosidase (ßgal) enzyme. The resulting enzymatic deficiency leads to accumulation of GM1-ganglioside in cells. Clinical presentation is mainly neurological with rapidly progressive impairment (motor, cognitive and behavioral) leading to premature death, mostly in early childhood. It is a devastating disease for patients and families. There is currently no disease modifying treatment available.About Lysogene Lysogene is a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering the basic research and clinical development of AAV gene therapy for CNS disorders with a high unmet medical need. Since 2009, Lysogene has established a solid platform and network, with lead products in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIA and GM1 Gangliosidosis, to become a global leader in orphan CNS diseases. Lysogene has also obtained ODD by the EMA and FDA and rare pediatric designation by the FDA for its MPS IIIA program. Lysogene is listed on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0013233475) For more information, visit www.lysogene.com.Contacts Media Europe Annie Florence NewCap afloyer@newcap.fr + 33 6 88 20 35 59 + 33 1 44 71 00 12Investors Chris Maggos LifeSci Advisors chris@lifesciadvisors.com +41 79 367 6254 North America Marion Janic RooneyPartners mjanic@rooneyco.com + 1 (212) 223-4017  22/02/2017   Michael Clayman, M.D., CEO of Flexion Therapeutics talk about the need for new treatment options for osteoarthritis (OA) and Flexion’s lead investigational product candidate, ZilrettaTM This morning, Michael Clayman, M.D., CEO of Flexion Therapeutics (Nasdaq:  FLXN), appeared live on Fox Business News to talk about the need for new treatment options for osteoarthritis (OA) and Flexion’s lead investigational product candidate, ZilrettaTM (FX006) which is being evaluated as a potential new therapy for OA related knee pain.  A link to Mike’s interview can be found below:http://finance.yahoo.com/video/developing-alternatives-opioids-relieve-pain-130004965.html 1 2 3 4 5 … 141
