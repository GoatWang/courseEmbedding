Why the Solea Dental Laser
Solea is the first laser that can cut any tissue simply by using a variable speed foot pedal, giving the user total control. Its revolutionary software is so simple, any dentist can become a laser dentist. With Solea’s unique wavelength and computer controls, dentists can reliably perform procedures anesthesia-free, blood-free, suture-free and pain-free. For dentists, these are powerful practice growth drivers – for patients it’s getting more done in fewer appointments. No other laser technology delivers such a dramatic reduction to procedure time, enables multi-quadrant dentistry, and allows dentists to perform more soft-tissue procedures that are often referred out.



Anesthesia Free
Solea laser dentists report doing the vast majority of their hard and soft tissue procedures without anesthesia. Not only are patients more comfortable, not injecting saves a lot of time for you and them.



Comprehensive Support
You will receive world-class training and support augmented by online courseware that is available before and after your initial training. You will have access to soleadoctors.com, a website where you can discover the capabilities, learn new procedures, and collaborate with other dentists sharing clinical technique using Solea.






Fast Cutting
Solea’s unique 9.3 µm wavelength operates significantly faster and quieter than any other hard tissue laser on the market. Solea’s speed and reliably anesthesia free performance mean you and your patients will benefit from dramatically-reduced chair time.



Easy Ramp Up
The Solea dental laser was designed for everyday dentists. One day of training is all you will need. It has a familiar handpiece, easy-to-navigate touch screen and a variable speed foot pedal, guaranteeing an easy transition.

The Science behind the Solea® Dental Laser  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on July 18, 2017 by Lanmark 360.
              



Solea® is an advanced dental technology that has revolutionized and disrupted the dental laser market forever. After years in development, Convergent Dental was ready in 2013 to introduce dentistry to a breakthrough technology that would finally position a dental laser as an instrument a dentist would come to rely on for every patient every day. The key to the company’s success and unprecedented growth over the years is directly attributed to the company’s commitment to innovation that was a leap over the native CO2 and erbium lasers currently on the market.


 





The Solea® Dental Laser and Soft Tissue Procedures: Add Revenue Streams for Your Dental Practice  
                  This entry was posted in  Solea  on June 26, 2017 by Lanmark 360.
              


It’s a fact: since the onset of the Great Recession in the late 2000s, many—if not all—American dental practitioners have felt and continue to feel the effects of the financial decline. In the Dental Economics article, Seven Ways the New Economy has Changed Dentistry, Dr. Roger P. Levin highlights various examples of how the industry has been impacted. For instance, certain patients have chosen to go without elective treatment, others have abandoned the dental system altogether, and moreover; most insurance carriers have created lower reimbursement plans that accommodate those who sit in the chair, but unfortunately harm the dentist.
Although the examples mentioned above are dissimilar, they all result in the same outcome, which is a reduction in profits for the dental practice.
Today in 2017, the recession is over and dentists have more opportunity than ever to be ambitious and generate as much revenue as possible for the growth of their practice. But how? The answer is simple: transition to laser dentistry and begin offering more treatment options that serve patients’ needs in-house.







Supporting Dentists’ Solea® Laser Journey

When dentists choose the Solea dental laser, they aren’t just receiving the industry’s #1 all-tissue laser; they’re also getting a complete experience that includes an unparalleled level of support that will help prepare their practice for success when it comes to understanding Solea and most importantly, providing patient care.


 





Facebook for Dental Practices: Growing Your Practice Online  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on April 25, 2017 by Lanmark 360.
              


Over the past five years Facebook has been expanding its capabilities far beyond simply staying in touch with friends and family, giving business owners a variety of ways to create a valuable online presence.
Today, Facebook is a powerful and cost-effective tool for dentists looking to acquire new patients and stay top of mind among their current patients, provided you approach the platform with the right strategy.
By following a few guiding principles you can position your practice for success on Facebook.







Are Dental Lasers Right for Your Practice?  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on March 22, 2017 by Lanmark 360.
              



Purchasing a new piece of dental technology is an important moment for the dental practice. There are a number of different factors that could influence this decision ranging from how the technology could impact patient experience, or enhance the procedures currently offered.
Ultimately, dentists must consider if a piece of technology is right for their practice and whether or not it addresses common issues or situations they encounter. If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, then dental lasers could be a perfect fit for your practice.


 





Dental Laser Misconceptions: Debunking Common Myths  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on February 23, 2017 by Lanmark 360.
              


 

Dental lasers, like many other dental technologies, are the subject of a variety of different opinions surrounding their functionality and overall benefit to the dental practice. While it’s always sensible to do research on and consult with peers before making a purchase, many of the common thoughts about dental lasers are major misconceptions. To give you a better idea of the true benefits of an all-tissue dental laser we’re going to debunk three of the most common dental laser myths.







Spread the Word: Marketing Your Practice’s Dental Technology  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on January 23, 2017 by Lanmark 360.
              


The growth of dental technology has pushed the industry forward in incredible ways. Dental professionals now have a number of new, streamlined ways to approach treatments unavailable without leading technology. Practices that use Solea®, a dental laser capable of reliably anesthesia-free dentistry, are able to offer patients unprecedented treatment compared to practices relying on traditional high-speed drills. However, it isn’t enough to own Solea and provide advanced treatment to your existing patients. In order to properly reap the rewards of your technology and grow your practice you have to understand how to market yourself as a laser dentist.
Effectively spreading the word about Solea’s many patient-centric benefits requires knowing how to best communicate information to patients, and where patients are going to interact with your practice.


 





Redefining the Patient Experience with the Solea® Dental Laser  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on December 28, 2016 by Lanmark 360.
              



It is no secret not only children, but even adults fear going to the dentist; in fact, the American Dental Association (ADA) once addressed this issue by providing a compilation of statistics that spoke to the adult patient’s frequency of visits. The findings revealed that in 2014, 52.3% of adults saw their dentist every six months in the last few years, 15.4% reported once per year, and 11.0% said they went every two to three years. However, most astounding was the fact that an overwhelming 21.3% confessed that it had been quite some time since they have sat in an operatory chair. We could speculate as to why one-in-five adult patients chose to avoid their two annual visits; perhaps they did not have the availability, or maybe it had to do with something else: the fear of encountering the dreaded drill.

When dentists begin using Solea it often becomes the centerpiece of the entire practice, streamlining more difficult procedures and offering patients reliably anesthesia-free treatments. To learn more about Solea’s impact on the dental practice, we spoke with three dentists to learn about their expectations of Solea before using it and what they think of Solea after bringing it into their practice.


 





Dental Lasers Demystified

From an outside perspective, laser dentistry can appear daunting. You may have heard about lasers at a trade show or had a few discussions with colleagues, but still have plenty of questions about the different kinds of lasers on the market and whether any of them are a good fit for your practice. To help demystify dental lasers, we’ll take a high-level look at CO2 lasers, Erbium lasers, and what sets Solea® apart.

Efficient.
Easy.
Phenomenal.
Epic.
Dentists have used all of these words to describe Solea’s technology and its impact on their patients. They’ve said things like: “It works so quickly and efficiently – the experience the patient receives is so much better than traditional dentistry.” And: “Solea continues to amaze me on a daily basis.” Of course, hearing that makes us smile, but we’re always striving to innovate. To that end, every year, we meet with dentists from around the country to provide a platform where we can share our latest technology innovations and Solea dentists can collaborate, discover and learn new techniques to enhance their experience with Solea and the experience of their patients.


 





The Changing Face of Dentistry with Dr. David Garber  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on August 29, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              



Last week, we were honored to welcome Dr. David Garber to Boston to lead an evening discussion followed by a one day hands-on session with Solea. Dr. David Garber is a renowned expert in the dental community. He has won the Gordon J. Christensen Lecturer Recognition Award, the David Serson Medal of Research, is an honorary member of the Kois Center for Advancing Dentistry Through Science, as well as a past president of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry (AAED) and board member of both the AAED and the American Academy of Fixed Prosthodontics. Having been a leader in the field for decades, he drew quite the crowd. We, like the rest of the audience, took out our notepad and enjoyed learning from the best. Below are our event and presentation highlights.







Solea Dental Laser Clinical Results  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on July 22, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              



Treating Interproximal Carious Lesions, Crown Lengthening, Fractured Amalgam, and Recurrent Decay with Joshua P. Weintraub, DDS
For a long time, dental lasers have struggled to deliver predictable clinical performance. As an experienced laser dentist, Dr. Joshua Weintraub has invested in many different types of lasers, including erbium (2.9 μm), Nd:YAG (1.064 μm), and diode (0.81 μm). He saw the potential of laser technology, but struggled to experience the consistent results promised. With Solea, Dr. Weintraub finally has a technology with which he can confidently and safely perform anesthesia-free and blood-free procedures for the majority of his cases, including interproximal carious lesions, crown lengthening, fractured amalgam, and recurrent decay.


 





Solea Laser Setup Practice  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on June 15, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              



At Dr. Bernstein’s office, a young patient with braces faced a complicated situation. The 14 year-old patient presented with extensive gingival hyperplasia. Her orthodontic appliance made it hard to maintain oral hygiene so there was significant gingival hypertrophy on 24 teeth. Traditionally dentists would reach for a scalpel, which requires anesthesia and follow-up sutures. Dr. Bernstein offers his patients a less invasive alternative using Solea.







INTRODUCING SOLEA 3.0 – The Next Big Breakthrough in Lasers is Here.  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on May 11, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              



The Laser that changed dentistry is changing it again. When Solea first launched, it delivered on the promise of a reliable dental laser that increased efficiencies, added new procedures to a dentist’s repertoire and improved the dental experience for doctors and patients alike. Since that day, we haven’t stopped innovating. Solea 3.0 is our most impressive software update yet. It’s easy to use, intuitive, and handles like a dream. One of our Solea dentists said, “I feel as if I’m driving a new Formula 1… and it’s exhilarating!”


 





Solea Laser Reduces Dentist Stress  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on April 28, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              



At the beginning of the year, Dental Products Report released a survey about the mental state of today’s dentist, and author Kevin Henry’s findings paint a pretty stressful picture. As a partner to many private practices, we can certainly empathize. We can also offer a solution. For those looking for a way to alleviate some of the most common stresses in dentistry today, take a look at Solea.







Solea Laser Success Stories  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on March 17, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              



Unlike any other piece of dental technology, Solea is something patients want to talk and tweet about. Since the launch, we’ve seen videos and photos from patients across the country, commenting on Solea’s impact on their dental experience. The best part is that people are often sharing on their own accord. Other times, dentists are asking patients to reflect on their experience. In both cases, practices are able to capture genuine, relatable reactions to Solea’s stress-free dentistry.








Dr. Fantarella on the Solea Dental Laser  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on February 17, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              



Dr. David Fantarella had been using an erbium laser for five years when Solea hit the market. Unlike the erbium laser, Solea allowed him to perform a greater breadth of procedures at a faster rate and drastically improved his patient’s experience in the chair. Today, at his office in New Haven, Connecticut, he uses Solea on virtually every patient, every day.







Successful Frenectomies Utilizing Solea Improve Pediatric Dentistry  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on January 19, 2016 by Olivia Munro.
              


At Dr. Lawrence Kotlow’s Albany, New York dental practice, families are traveling from near and far for treatment for their children.
 
To witness Solea’s unrivaled ability to improve the patient experience, visit Dr. Lawrence Kotlow’s practice in Albany, New York, where families from near and far are traveling to his office for a new kind of frenectomy procedure. Traditionally, frenectomies are an invasive operation that requires anesthesia and pose a serious challenge for parents who fear a painful experience for their kids. Utilizing Solea’s technology, Dr. Kotlow pioneered a new process to treat infant and toddler patients quickly and comfortably.


 





Training and Technology: How to Integrate Lasers Into Your Dental Practice  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on December 21, 2015 by Olivia Munro.
              



Since Solea hit the market two years ago, we have worked hand in hand with dentists and their staff to ensure that Solea is fully integrated into users’ daily practice. With any new technology, training is essential. Not only to ensure technical fluency, but also to ensure staff can communicate confidently and accurately with patients.







Improving Patient Comfort and Satisfaction with Solea  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on November 12, 2015 by Olivia Munro.
              


For most people, leaving the dentist without control of one side of their face is extremely uncomfortable. And yet, it’s not uncommon. For hours after a routine procedure, the lingering effects of Novocain can make the most basic things difficult: eating, drinking, even going back to work. Solea offers a drastically improved alternative.


 





Solea Laser Standard of Care

Dr. John Herzog, who has practiced general and restorative dentistry for over thirty years, is one of many who have found that Solea not only improves his patients’ experience, it makes his job easier.

How Solea is Changing the Pediatric Dental Experience  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on August 20, 2015 by Olivia Munro.
              



The data tells us that it doesn’t matter how old you are: going to the dentist can be anxiety-inducing. With Solea, it doesn’t have to be. Solea’s speed and precision not only saves time, they also allow dentists to complete procedures without the drill’s unpleasant side effects and discomfort. Solea, quite simply, has fundamentally changed the patient experience.







Solea Transforms How Patients Experience the Dentist  
                  This entry was posted in  Uncategorized  on July 29, 2015 by Olivia Munro.
              



Whenever most people think of the dentist, they feel uneasy. They remember the noise of the drill and its uncomfortable vibrations. Thanks to Solea, the first FDA approved CO2 laser, those memories are becoming a thing of the past. Solea eliminates the dread that prevents nearly one third of Americans from visiting the dentist every year.

BBB Accreditation



        Convergent Dental, Inc. has maintained 0 year 10 months of continuous BBB Accreditation.
    

                BBB Accredited Since 09/19/2016
            

                BBB has determined that Convergent Dental, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
