He has served for many years as an Adjunct Professor of Administrative Law at Widener University School of Law and has been a frequent lecturer on appellate advocacy, utility law and ethical considerations for the Pennsylvania Bar Institute.  He received the law school’s Faculty Distinguished Service Award.
