The Priceline Group is an American-based[3] provider of travel and related online services to consumers and local partners through six primary brands: Booking.com, Priceline.com, agoda.com, KAYAK, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable. Collectively The Priceline Group operates in over 200 countries and territories in over 40 languages. It made 86% of its bookings outside the United States in 2015 and is the biggest online travel agency worldwide.[1]

History[edit]
In 1997, Priceline.com, an online travel site, launched using its signature Name Your Own Price bidding model. In 1999, The Priceline Group underwent its initial public offering and reached $12.9 billion in market value on the first day, the highest first day value for a corporation at the time. This same year, the company also experimented with selling other products and services such as groceries, gasoline, home mortgages, cars, and more through its Name Your Own Price service. This offering was later discontinued in 2000.
Jeff Boyd was named Chief Executive Officer in 2002 and remained in that role until becoming Chairman of the Board for The Priceline Group in 2013.[8]

In 2004, the company acquired major stakes in Travelweb and Active Hotels.[9]
In 2005, the company acquired Booking.com and merged it with Active Hotels.[10]
In 2007, the company acquired Agoda.com, an Asian-based online hotel retailer.[11]
In 2010, the company acquired TravelJigsaw, a multinational rental car service operated as rentalcars.com and Rideways.[12]
In 2013, the company acquired kayak.com, a travel metasearch engine for $1.8 billion.[13]
In 2014, the company acquired OpenTable for $2.6 billion.[14]

Amazon stock touches $1,000 for the first time ever 
Shares of Amazon Inc. on Tuesday hit an intraday record, exceeding $1,000 a share for the first time ever and joining a unique club of companies whose stock carries a four-digit price tag. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20, just near the open of Tuesday trade. Amazon's shares are up about 33% so far in 2017, according to FactSet data. The technology behemoth run by Jeff Bezos, which boasts a market value of roughly $480 billion, joins a rare $1,000-a-share club, which includes names like Berkshire Hathaway , Priceline Group Inc.  and homebuilder NVR Inc. . Moves in Amazon's stock came as the Nasdaq Composite Index  was tilting higher in early trade, on track for a record. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  and the S&P 500 index  were trading near break-even levels, but have broadly been in an uptrend, following Friday's record close for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.

Facebook set to get 'a lot more money' from Priceline
Facebook Inc.'s  travel ads site for businesses could be in line for a big payoff, if it can just iron out a few things to make a key customer happy. When Priceline.com Inc. Chief Executive Glenn Fogel was asked in the travel services site's post-earnings conference call about Facebook's new retargeting product for travel, Fogel said the company was working with Facebook to improve the product to get more business done. He said "we would like to spend a lot more money with Facebook," but are working with the company to come up with tools and other ways to maximize the return on investment, according to a transcript of the call provided by FactSet. "When that happens, we are ready, willing, able to spend a lot of money with them to find another way to get customers," Fogel said, according to the FactSet transcript. Facebook's stock slipped 0.2% in midday trade. It has soared 30.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.1%.

Breaking            
Amazon stock touches $1,000 for the first time ever 
Shares of Amazon Inc. on Tuesday hit an intraday record, exceeding $1,000 a share for the first time ever and joining a unique club of companies whose stock carries a four-digit price tag. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20, just near the open of Tuesday trade. Amazon's shares are up about 33% so far in 2017, according to FactSet data. The technology behemoth run by Jeff Bezos, which boasts a market value of roughly $480 billion, joins a rare $1,000-a-share club, which includes names like Berkshire Hathaway , Priceline Group Inc.  and homebuilder NVR Inc. . Moves in Amazon's stock came as the Nasdaq Composite Index  was tilting higher in early trade, on track for a record. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  and the S&P 500 index  were trading near break-even levels, but have broadly been in an uptrend, following Friday's record close for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.

Facebook set to get 'a lot more money' from Priceline
Facebook Inc.'s  travel ads site for businesses could be in line for a big payoff, if it can just iron out a few things to make a key customer happy. When Priceline.com Inc. Chief Executive Glenn Fogel was asked in the travel services site's post-earnings conference call about Facebook's new retargeting product for travel, Fogel said the company was working with Facebook to improve the product to get more business done. He said "we would like to spend a lot more money with Facebook," but are working with the company to come up with tools and other ways to maximize the return on investment, according to a transcript of the call provided by FactSet. "When that happens, we are ready, willing, able to spend a lot of money with them to find another way to get customers," Fogel said, according to the FactSet transcript. Facebook's stock slipped 0.2% in midday trade. It has soared 30.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 7.1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
