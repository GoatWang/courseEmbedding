("Hexion" or the "Company") announced today the consideration to be paid in its previously announced cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the outstanding 9% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2014, issued by Hexion U.S. Finance Corp. and Hexion Nova Scotia Finance, ULC (the "9% Notes"). The tender offer and consent solicitation is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Hexion's Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated October 12, 2006 and the related Consent and Letter of Transmittal (the "Offer Documents").

The total consideration for the 9% Notes which will be payable in respect of 9% Notes accepted for payment that were validly tendered with consents delivered and not withdrawn on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 24, 2006, will be $1,133.84 per $1,000 principal amount of 9% Notes. Hexion currently expects to accept for payment, subject to conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, all of the validly tendered 9% Notes on Friday, November 3, 2006; accordingly, the total consideration for the 9% Notes was determined assuming payment on such date. In addition to the total consideration, which includes a consent payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of 9% Notes, Hexion will pay accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the payment date for 9% Notes purchased in the Tender Offer.

The tender offer by Hexion will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 13, 2006, unless extended or earlier terminated by Hexion (the "Expiration Date"). In the event that the Expiration Date is extended, new pricing terms may be determined. Information regarding the pricing, tender and delivery procedures and conditions to the tender offer and consent solicitation relating to the 9% Notes is contained in the Offer Documents.

Hexion's tender offer is subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer Documents including, among other things, Hexion obtaining the financing necessary to pay for the Notes and consents in accordance with the terms of the tender offer and consent solicitation.

Hexion has retained Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC to act as Dealer Manager in connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation.

The tender offer and consent solicitation is being made solely by means of the Offer Documents. Under no circumstances shall this press release constitute an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell the 9% Notes or any other securities of Hexion. It also is not a solicitation of consents to the proposed amendments to the indentures and the collateral agreements. No recommendation is made as to whether holders of the 9% Notes should tender their notes or give their consents.

Columbus, Ohio, USA, 05 January 2010 -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc. announced today that Hexion Finance Escrow LLC and Hexion Escrow Corporation (the escrow Issuers), wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries of the company, are proposing to issue USD 700 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2018 in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
The proceeds of the offering initially will be placed in escrow pending satisfaction of a number of conditions, including effectiveness of the proposed amendment of the existing senior secured credit facilities of the company. Upon satisfaction of such conditions, Hexion U.S. Finance Corporation and Hexion Nova Scotia Finance, ULC, each a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, would jointly assume the escrow issuers’ obligations under the notes and the notes would be guaranteed by the company and by certain domestic subsidiaries of the company. The entities that are intended to assume and guarantee the notes are the same entities that issued and guarantee the company’s existing second lien notes. The notes will be secured by the same collateral as the company’s existing second lien notes, but the priority of the collateral liens securing the notes will be senior to the collateral liens securing the existing second lien notes, and will be junior to the collateral liens securing the Registrant’s senior secured credit facilities. 
The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of notes, (i) to repay USD 500 million of the U.S. term loans under its existing USD 2.2 billion senior secured credit facilities, (ii) provide incremental liquidity and (iii) to pay certain related transaction costs and expenses. The proposed offering of the Notes is subject to market and other conditions, and may not occur as described or at all.
The notes are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States, only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S. The notes will not be initially registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws.

 
Based in Columbus, Ohio, Hexion Specialty Chemicals serves the global wood and industrial markets through a broad range of thermoset technologies, specialty products and technical support for customers in a diverse range of applications and industries. Hexion Specialty Chemicals is controlled by an affiliate of Apollo Management, L.P. Additional information is available at www.hexion.com.

INC., a New Jersey corporation, each Domestic Subsidiary Loan Party
party thereto and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., as Administrative
Agent (in such capacity, the “ Administrative Agent
”) for the Lenders (as defined therein).

A.
Reference is made to the Third Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of January 29, 2010 (as amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time, the
“ Credit Agreement ”), among Hexion LLC, Hexion

”), Hexion Specialty Chemicals Canada, Inc. (f/k/a Borden
Chemical Canada, Inc.) (the “ Canadian Borrower
”), Hexion Specialty Chemicals B.V. (f/k/a Resolution Europe
B.V.) (the “ Dutch Borrower ”), Hexion Specialty

for the Lenders, Citicorp North America, Inc., as syndication

as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.

B.
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit
Agreement and the Guaranty.

C. The
Guarantors have entered into the Guaranty in order to induce the
Lenders to make Loans and accept and purchase B/As and each Issuing
Bank to issue Letters of Credit. Section 12 of the Guaranty
provides that additional Subsidiaries may become Guarantors under
the Guaranty by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form
of this Supplement. The undersigned Subsidiary (the “ New
Subsidiary ”) is executing this Supplement in accordance
with the requirements of the Credit Agreement to become a Guarantor
under the Guaranty in order to induce the Lenders to make
additional Loans and accept and purchase additional B/As and each
Issuing Bank to issue additional Letters of Credit and as
consideration for Loans previously made, B/As previously accepted
and Letters of Credit previously issued.

Accordingly,
the Administrative Agent and the New Subsidiary agree as
follows:

SECTION 1.
In accordance with Section 12 of the Guaranty, the New
Subsidiary by its signature below becomes a Guarantor under the
Guaranty with the same force and effect as if originally named
therein as a Guarantor and the New Subsidiary hereby agrees to all
the terms and provisions of the Guaranty applicable to it as a
Guarantor thereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, the New
Subsidiary does hereby guarantee to the Administrative Agent the
due and punctual payment of the Guaranteed Obligations as set forth
in the Guaranty. Each reference to a “Guarantor” in the
Guaranty shall be deemed to include the New Subsidiary. The
Guaranty is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 2.
The New Subsidiary represents and warrants to the Administrative
Agent and the other Secured Parties that this Supplement has been
duly authorized, executed and 

 


 


delivered
by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
(i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally, (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and
(iii) implied covenants of good faith and fair
dealing.

SECTION 3.
This Supplement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken
together shall constitute but one contract. This Supplement shall
become effective when (a) the Administrative Agent shall have
received a counterpart of this Supplement that bears the signature
of the New Subsidiary and (b) the Administrative Agent has
executed a counterpart hereof. Delivery of an executed signature
page to this Supplement by facsimile transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this
Supplement.

SECTION 4.
Except as expressly supplemented hereby, the Guaranty shall remain
in full force and effect.

SECTION 5.
THIS SUPPLEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES UNDER
THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED
BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 6.
In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Supplement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions contained herein and in the Guaranty shall not in any
way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in
good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect
of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provisions.

SECTION 7.
All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and
given as provided in Section 5(d) of the Guaranty.

SECTION 8.
The New Subsidiary agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent for
its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with this
Supplement, including the reasonable fees, disbursements and other
charges of counsel for the Administrative Agent.
