NuStar Energy L.P. recently announced that it has signed an agreement to purchase crude oil and refined product storage assets in the Port of Corpus Christi from Martin Midstream Partners L.P. for a net $93 million. The acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, is expected to be immediately accretive to NuStar’s earnings based on the terminal’s current, actual volumes. It also reflects an approximate seven times multiple based on the forecasted four-year average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) attributable to the assets of $13.5 million annually. When combined with NuStar’s existing terminal operations in Corpus Christi, the acquisition will give NuStar over 3.6 million barrels of total storage in the Port of Corpus Christi, including 3.1 million barrels of crude oil storage and 577,000 barrels of refined product storage.
The terminal NuStar is acquiring includes 1.15 million barrels of total storage, which is comprised of 900,000 barrels of crude oil storage and 250,000 barrels of refined product storage. The terminal has direct connectivity to Eagle Ford crude oil production and receives crude oil and condensate via its connection to the Harvest Pipeline and through its six-bay truck rack. The terminal has access to two of the port’s deep-water crude oil docks, including exclusive use of the port’s new crude oil dock, and a barge dock. The terminal is located on 25 acres, and has room for further expansion.
NuStar also expects to achieve significant operational synergies between its existing North Beach Terminal and the Martin terminal, which are located adjacent to each other in the Port of Corpus Christi.
“Corpus Christi has been a strategic hub for NuStar for many years, and we are very pleased to make this acquisition that will not only solidify our presence there, but also give us the ability to serve a new pipeline and new customers, and provide us greater connectivity to domestic and international crude oil and refined products markets,” said NuStar President and CEO Brad Barron. “Just as importantly, it will also allow us to better serve our existing customers. With the use of the docks that are part of this acquisition, we are better able to meet the future needs of an existing customer who is interested in increasing volumes and the length of their contract with us."
“And this terminal fits perfectly within our acquisition criteria as it is synergistic with our existing assets, is immediately accretive to earnings and has additional upside growth potential,” Barron added.

NuStar Closes on Accretive Acquisition That Further Expands Its Presence in Port of Corpus Christi | Business Wire
























































NuStar Closes on Accretive Acquisition That Further Expands Its 
      Presence in Port of Corpus Christi




NuStar completes purchase of crude oil and refined product 
      terminal assets from Martin Midstream Partners






December 21, 2016 03:13 PM Eastern Standard Time



SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NuStar Energy L.P. (NYSE: NS) today announced that it has closed on the 
      purchase of crude oil and refined product terminal assets in Corpus 
      Christi, Texas from Martin Midstream Partners (Nasdaq: MMLP) for a net 
      $93 million. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to 
      NuStar’s earnings based on the terminal’s current, actual volumes, 
      generating a seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
      and amortization (EBITDA) multiple based on an annual average EBITDA 
      estimate of approximately $13.5 million.
    


      With the addition of the terminal, which is adjacent to NuStar’s 
      existing North Beach Terminal, NuStar now has over 3.6 million barrels 
      of total storage in the Port of Corpus Christi, including 3.1 million 
      barrels of crude oil storage and 577,000 barrels of refined product 
      storage.
    

      The terminal NuStar is acquiring includes 1.15 million barrels of total 
      storage, which is comprised of 900,000 barrels of crude oil storage and 
      250,000 barrels of refined product storage. The terminal has direct 
      connectivity to Eagle Ford crude oil production and receives crude oil 
      and condensate via its connection to the Harvest Pipeline and through 
      its six-bay truck rack. The terminal has access to two of the port’s 
      deep-water crude oil docks, including exclusive use of the port’s new 
      crude oil dock, and a barge dock. The terminal is located on 25 acres, 
      and has room for further expansion.
    

      “This acquisition further strengthens NuStar’s position as one of the 
      top logistics players in the Corpus Christi region, which has long been 
      a strategic hub for us,” said NuStar President and CEO Brad Barron. “We 
      now have access to a new pipeline and new customers, and greater 
      connectivity to domestic and international crude oil and refined 
      products markets, and an existing customer has expressed interest in 
      increasing volumes and the length of our contract with them thanks to 
      the increased dock space and capacity we now have.
    

      “We are also fortunate to bring aboard a strong workforce at the 
      terminal, and we are working with them to quickly integrate the terminal 
      into our system so that we can take advantage of the many operational 
      synergies between the terminal and our existing operations,” Barron 
      added.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information -- This news release 
      includes forecasted EBITDA. This is a non-GAAP financial measure. 
      Forecasted EBITDA is based on the partnership’s projections for the 
      assets acquired. Forecasted EBITDA is included to help facilitate 
      comparisons of operating performance of the partnership with other 
      companies in our industry, as well as help facilitate an assessment of 
      our assets' projected ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make 
      distributions to our partners. Forecasted EBITDA is not presented as an 
      alternative to the nearest GAAP financial measure, net income, and 
      should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of 
      performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are unable to present a 
      reconciliation of forecasted EBITDA to net income because certain 
      elements of net income, including interest, depreciation and taxes, are 
      not available. Together, these items generally result in EBITDA being 
      significantly greater than net income.

This press release includes forward-looking statements regarding 
      future events, such as the partnership’s future performance. All 
      forward-looking statements are based on the partnership’s beliefs as 
      well as assumptions made by and information currently available to the 
      partnership. These statements reflect the partnership’s current views

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
