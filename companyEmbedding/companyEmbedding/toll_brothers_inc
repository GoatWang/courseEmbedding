This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Company History
The Toll Brothers story.
At Toll Brothers, we love to say that our pride is palpable. Not only are we proud of the superior quality luxury homes we build, we're proud of the legacy we've crafted within the home building industry.
Our foundation.
It all started in the mid 1960s when two brothers, Bob and Bruce Toll, found the right piece of land in rural Pennsylvania and opened their first new home community in 1967. They had a vision for building more than just homes. Together, they recognized a growing demand for luxury homes within communities where amenities, convenience, and friendships created a unique lifestyle.
Our progress.
Decades later, we're proud to be the nation's premier builder of luxury homes. Our master-planned communities, golf courses, active living communities, and city living properties are located in 51 markets and 20 states across the U.S.
We're also proud of our multiple ancillary businesses, including mortgage services, engineering, component manufacturing, assembly, and beyond. By design, our subsidiaries are fully integrated with Toll Brothers to deliver on our brand.

July 28--A Kettering company is at the forefront of creating a virtual reality home shopping and design experience.
Toll Brothers Inc., a Horsham, Pa.-based home builder, said Thursday it has begun to pilot a tool to allow home buyers to use virtual reality to see design selections in homes and to make changes in what they see.
To bring what the company calls a "photo-real 3D home composition and an immersive experience to home-buyers," Toll Brothers is working with Kettering-based Marxent Labs LLC, a designer and creator of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology for major home builders, retailers, and manufacturers of building products.
The idea is to allow viewing of "millions of combinations for home buyers to find exactly what they're looking for in their perfect kitchen," the home company said in an announcement.
The' 3D configuration solution and floor plan visualizer offers home buyers a "realistic tour through the kitchen of the selected Toll Brothers home using a tablet or networked HTC Vive," Toll Brother said.
The tool, dubbed "Kitchen 360," leverages Marxent's "VisualCommerce" 3D product platform to allow customers to explore floor plans and design their kitchens.
Based in the Miami Valley Research Park, Marxent attracted $10 million in Series B investor funding for its work in 2016.
In 2015, Marxent more than doubled its workforce, expanding to about 50 developers, 3-D artists and designers.
