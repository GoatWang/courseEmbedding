This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Alumnus Joel Quadracci to present Harder Lecture

Alumnus Joel Quadracci to present Harder Lecture
J. Joel Quadracci '91

J. Joel Quadracci, chairman, president, and CEO of Quad/Graphics, will discuss "Transforming
                  a Company in a Complicated World" when he delivers the 27th annual F. William Harder
                  Endowed Lecture at Skidmore College. Free and open to the public, the lecture is scheduled
                  at 5:15 p.m. Wednesday, March 2, in Gannett Auditorium of Palamountain Hall. A reception
                  will follow. 
               
Joel Quadracci is responsible for guiding the overall strategic growth and success
                     of Quad/Graphics, continuing the tradition of Quadracci family leadership at the company
                     founded in 1971 by his father, the late Harry V. Quadracci.
Joel grew up with Quad/Graphics, watching it develop from a fledgling operation into
                     a leading printer of catalogs, magazines, and other commercial products.
He officially joined Quad/Graphics in 1991, the year he earned a B.A. degree in philosophy
                     at Skidmore College. After completing the company's corporate training program, he
                     focused on sales and became a sales manager in 1995, manager of the New York City

                     of F. William Harder, a Skidmore parent who served as trustee from 1968 to 1980. The
