Pavers




Flagstone & Landscape Rocks in San Jose, CA


Pavers come in forms as varied as natural stone, concrete, clay and even recycled plastics. For patio installations, most in the business recommend either stone or concrete pavers, which, due to their higher density, may be expected to last longer and undergo less color fading than other paver types.



Concrete pavers in particular are a mainstay of patio building, beloved for their easy installation and the range of sizes, shapes, and colors in which they can be found. Inevitably, this manmade product lends itself to a less “natural” look, although some concrete pavers are manufactured to look like natural stone or clay brick.

Modular, Prefab, and Compact Options for Green Homes and Structures


Below is a listing of companies that offer green dwellings in the form of modular, prefab/manufactured, compact and/or mobile structures. These days, there are many such options available that are not only green, but also beautiful, well-made, and often low-cost. Some of these structures are homes or cabins/cottages, while others can be used as an addition, a backyard studio, office, in-law unit/guest house, or some other type of “accessory dwelling unit.”

They come in a wide range of sizes, from teeny-tiny one-room spaces (e.g., 100 sq. ft.) and small units (see the Tiny/Compact Structures section below) to conventionally sized homes. They are also available in a wide variety of styles; some have traditional designs, while others have a very modern look. Some are available as plans and/or DIY kits, and others have designated builders. Many can be modified or customized.
Prefab (factory-built) homes have many benefits. They can be built more efficiently (e.g., less material waste), more quickly, with more precision and durability (i.e., higher quality), and they typically have more predictable costs (and often cost less) than site-built homes.
The levels of greenness vary among the following options, but all of them tout some green features.
This is not a comprehensive listing; there are many other companies that make similar types of green structures. I’ve provided links below to other directories that list additional options. If you know of another green modular, prefab, mobile, or small home designer or manufacturer that you would recommend, please share it in the Comments.
Note: The asterisk (*) shown after certain listings indicates that those companies seem to offer at least one low-cost/affordable option. Some of the other companies might also offer such options, but specific pricing isn’t available on all of the websites; in some cases, one must contact the company for pricing information. Scroll down to the second half of the post for a listing of companies that specialize in tiny/compact homes or structures.

There has been a recent trend of constructing more permanent modular buildings that require more on site construction. Modular buildings can be used for different purposes. Schools, classrooms, daycare centers and dormitories are being built. Modular construction is also used to build office buildings, clubhouses and health care facilities.

These “Green Home” designs are great and would be fun to own one! I especially like the house boat home.

Urban Rio, Panama's First Affordable Green Container Project 



UPDATE 3/16/09 – Urban Core International has gone dark.  The website was shut down.  If you have any concerns, feel free to contact us.  
Aaron Newman, founder and managing partner of Urban Core International, sent me the details of his latest project, Urban Rio.  Specifically, Urban Rio is a product of Urban Core's prefab and container division called Envision Prefab.  It's easy on the eyes, to say the least, and just so happens to be the first sustainable, affordable, container project in Panama.  
  
Urban Rio units will have energy-efficient appliances, HEPA filters, energy-efficient split air conditioners, smart lighting controls, a water recycling and reclamation system, low-flow faucets and toilets, tankless hot water heaters, and a living green roof.  Urban Rio will be located in Rio Abajo, Panama City, and will have 5 units in total.  Units will have two bedrooms and 1 bathroom and start selling upon receiving the local approvals.  Can't wait to see the real thing.

Hi Preston,
I enjoyed checking out your blog.  I’m a recent grad in Silicon Valley, and I’ve just started a company that is mapping the blogosphere to our world.  Here is an example of a blogger in Georgia who’s plugged in: http://www.verveearth.com/landing/#type=user&id=772.  It can be fun to explore different localities.
It’s an easy process to get on board, and I can be reached at [email protected] for questions or feedback.  If you resonate with the vision of painting a global canvas of voices, please give VerveEarth a mention.
Cheers!  -Clayton

Cool project!
Preston, would love to see you do more on green building in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), either here in your blog (which I always recommend to anyone who raises green building issues with me), or as a guest poster over at The Temas Blog.  I did a brief piece on Mexico’s forrays into LEED and related certification, and plan the same for Brazil, yet there’s much, much more going on but I don’t have the time to cover it properly.  Let me know if you’re interested.
Best Regards,
Keith R

@Keith R,
I’d love to guest blog or write about those things, but I’m just not that informed on what’s going on in those countries.  I lived in Japan, and stayed in Taiwan and China, so I have some familiarity there.  If I run across a good story, I’ll let you know …

Hi Peterson.
This one I diiiiiig.
Very soon I am coming to Caldera Chiriquí to start building a  modest B&b and my house on my lot. My idea was to use local materials like lava rocks with some modern sustainable materials.
I also am into exploration of starting a bio diesel crop planting and producing  off  The Jatropha plant.
Was for a long time contemplating the containers  architecture system.  I’m landing in Panama City the end of this month (march 2008). Would like to see the project and explore possibilities to erect one great example in the Bouqete area,  (as opposed to other  reckless monumental environmental  calamities going on there by greedy entrepreneurs).   Please contact me.
Cheers to Green living.
Hanan.

Is it possible to buy container homes for delivery in Panama?  I am in Los Santos in the south by Cambutal and would like some housing on my property for long term and to use immediately.

Your go-to resource for greening your home.


 

 




 


Home





A home is more than just shelter: Homes are the most important buildings in our lives. We think that all buildings should be green buildings—but especially homes. 
Why? Green homes are healthier for occupants and also use less energy and water, reducing utility bills each month. In many markets, certified green homes — like LEED homes — are selling quicker and for more money than comparable non-green homes.
Brought to you by the U.S. Green Building Council, the creators of the LEED green building program, Green Home Guide offers homeowners, apartment dwellers, prosumers and do-it-yourselfers the tips and tools to make better decisions toward greening their homes. Whether you are making small, incremental improvements over time or want to make the full effort to earn LEED certification, we are here for you.

Pavers




Flagstone & Landscape Rocks in San Jose, CA


Pavers come in forms as varied as natural stone, concrete, clay and even recycled plastics. For patio installations, most in the business recommend either stone or concrete pavers, which, due to their higher density, may be expected to last longer and undergo less color fading than other paver types.



Concrete pavers in particular are a mainstay of patio building, beloved for their easy installation and the range of sizes, shapes, and colors in which they can be found. Inevitably, this manmade product lends itself to a less “natural” look, although some concrete pavers are manufactured to look like natural stone or clay brick.
