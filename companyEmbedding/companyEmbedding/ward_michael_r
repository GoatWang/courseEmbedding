Product Substitutability and Competition in Long-Distance Telecommunications 
By Ward, Michael R.

Article excerpt

  I. INTRODUCTION    The growing availability of detailed firm-level data and advances in econometric techniques have led to the estimation of industry structural parameters in order to evaluate proposed policy changes (Hausman, Leonard, and Zona [1994]). In particular, estimates of own and cross-elasticities of demand are used to draw inferences about competition under various assumptions about producer behavior (e.g., Hausman [1994] and Stern [1994]). Generating estimates of structural parameters requires not only price and demand data but often requires firm-level factor price data to be used as instrumental variables. Even when firm-level factor price data are available, they may not fulfill the independence requirements of residual demand estimators because the competitors purchase from the same input market. Because the data requirements for the estimation of Marshallian demand elasticities are less severe, they may yield unbiased estimates. Residual demand elasticities can then be constructed under various assumptions about the extent of pricing coordination among producers.    This article carries out this process for the U.S. long-distance telecommunications industry. A unique and detailed data set that includes firm-level output, price, and factor price information is employed. The analysis focuses on the so-called Basket 1 services, which are ordinary interstate and international message toll service, operator assistance, and calling-card service. These services are generally regarded as the ones in which AT&T is likely to possess the most market power. Despite the detailed nature of the available data, some of the factor prices are shown to lead to biased estimates when used as instrumental variables. Results from specifications that omit these instruments indicate that AT&T faces a Marshallian demand elasticity of about -10. Residual demand elasticities are estimated for various assumptions regarding the degree of pricing coordination in the industry. For plausible assumptions regarding the degree of price coordination among firms, AT&T's residual demand elasticity is likely below-5, implying an industry dead-weight loss of less than 1.5% revenues.    Since the courts and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened U.S. long-distance telecommunications to competitive entry, the number and size of entrants has grown to the point that AT&T, once the legal monopolist, now supplies less than half of the total market. The FCC's incremental approach to deregulating AT&T decreased regulatory oversight in specific product markets as competition became more vigorous and culminated in its 1995 decision to declare AT&T "nondominant," essentially deregulating AT&T. The results of this analysis tend to support this decision. Nevertheless, debate over the extent of competition continues, primarily to evaluate the claim that allowing the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) into these markets will yield consumer benefits from still more vigorous competition. This analysis suggests that these benefits are likely to be small. Hence, as Brennan [1987] points out, the case for permitting BOC entry into long-distance should focus on whether they are likely to provide the service at lower cost or whether they have scope for discriminatory actions, rather than on whether they will make the long-distance market substantially more competitive.    II. PREVIOUS STUDIES    The extent of competition in the U.S. long-distance industry and the effects of price regulation have been the subject of policy interest and the focus of a few empirical studies. MacAvoy's [1995] analyses lead him to conclude that the industry is increasingly collusive. His event study finds that a portfolio of MCI and Sprint stock realizes positive abnormal returns when an AT&T price increase is reported. While this indicates that the industry is imperfectly competitive, it could result from either unilateral or coordinated pricing behavior. …

Susceptibility and Influence in Social Contagion
Social contagion plays an important role in many product adoption decisions but identification of causal effects is challenging. We identify causal social contagion effects in the empirical setting of video game adoption in a social network for gamers by exploiting differences in individuals’ networks. Because friends of friends do not directly influence a focal user, we use their exogenous characteristics to instrument for behavior of the focal user’s friends. We go beyond demonstrating a large and highly significant contagion effect and also assess moderating factors of the strength of the effect on the sender and receiver side. We find that users with the most influence on others tend to be high performers, focus on a more limited set of products, and send fewer signals. Interestingly, these are also the users who are least susceptible to peer effects. Furthermore, individuals with the largest networks exert more influence on others.

Strategic Timing of Entry: Evidence from Video Games
This paper investigates how video game publishers’ choice of game release date is affected by the expected level of competition within the game’s product niche. We identify game niches by genre, age-appropriateness, console system, a release cohort, and publisher. First, we show that consumer substitution across games is stronger within most of the dimensions describing product niches. Sales volumes decay quickly after the opening weekend, so at any point in time, a niche will typically be served by few current titles. From this, we calculate that delaying game release one week yields substantial increase in revenue for a video game facing higher than average competition. Next, we directly test for competition avoidance by showing that games are more likely to be released so as to avoid weeks when their niche already faces competition.

Cutting Class to Play Video Games
New leisure activities that make use of advances in information technology have become an increasingly popularity pastimes that can crowd out time spent on other activities. I exploit week-to-week variation in video game popularity to identify variation in video game playing time likely due to changes in game quality rather than to individuals selecting into gaming. I find that when video game sales increase, students spend more time playing games, and less time attending class. College students have larger differential effect likely due to either less parental supervision or more flexibility in their class schedule. Newly developing ICT based past-times, such as use of online social media, could have similar effects.

Mobile Telecommunications Service and Economic Growth: Evidence from China
We contribute to the role of telecommunications service on economic growth in three ways. We separately examine fixed-line and mobile telephone subscription levels. We compare results across periods and regions that differ by the level of development. In addition, we develop a method designed to address endogeneity of telecommunications with respect to growth. We find that mobile services contribute much more to growth but that the effect diminishes as the provincial economy develops more.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
