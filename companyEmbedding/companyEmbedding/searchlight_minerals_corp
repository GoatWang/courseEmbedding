Provides Update on Its Clarkdale Slag ProjectMarketwiredMarch 10, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareHENDERSON, NV--(Marketwired - Mar 10, 2015) - Searchlight Minerals Corp. (  OTCQB :  SRCH ) ("Searchlight" or the "Company") today provided an update on its Clarkdale Slag Project as it continues its autoclave testing and optimization of gold recovery and moves towards commercial operation and project feasibility.Current Work ProgramThe Company is currently working on all the following key steps in an effort to move expeditiously towards commercial operation:1. Pre-treatment: Optimization of the thermal pre-treatment of the slag prior to autoclaving is well underway resulting in lowering the required operating parameters and thereby lowering the expected unit operation cost while still producing a high quality iron product. The Company believes it has optimized the flux formulation for the thermal pre-treatment, resulting in reducing the flux required by approximately 50%. This has the net effect of doubling the capacity of the autoclave and cutting the per-ton melting cost significantly. The Company has recently completed multiple thermal pretreatment tests using the new flux chemistry. These tests have consistently yielded .47 ounces per ton gold (or greater) contained in the glass with less than 2% of the gold reporting to the iron product. The iron product produced has been consistently greater than 90% pure iron.As a potentially lower cost alternative to the thermal pretreatment used thus far, the Company has also contacted a major international iron and steel producer regarding use of their patented commercial technology used in direct reduction of iron. The producer has agreed to perform a series of bench tests with its technology, to determine such technology's applicability. The Company is currently reviewing the producer's proposal and these tests are expected to begin within the next few weeks.2. Optimization Testing: The Company has begun testing of the bench and pilot scale autoclave to determine optimum operating conditions with regard to best ratio of solids to liquid in the autoclave and ideal contact time. Once this testing is completed, the results will be used for the design of the autoclave. The Company has also ordered certain required components to switch from using chlorine reagents to chlorine gas. The Company believes that this will not only significantly lower supply costs on the commercial unit but will eliminate the potential problems of salt formation in the autoclave which plugged the autoclave discharge in one of the four last pilot scale autoclave runs. The Company anticipates that this will also simplify and increase recovery of gold from the Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS).3. Vendor Estimates: The Company is obtaining cost estimates from various commercial vendors on all of the major equipment components (thermal pre-treatment, HPGR, tower mill, autoclave, etc.) in an effort to tighten projections for its various business plan scenarios moving forward.4. Personnel: The Company is starting to hire additional personnel skilled in crushing, site design and autoclave design and operation.

In addition, I anticipate issuing periodic status reports on the Company's progress."About Searchlight Minerals Corp.Searchlight is an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties and slag reprocessing projects.

Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.
