            COMMENTEMAILMORELONG BEACH TOWNSHIP –  For the last two years, Mayor Joseph H. Mancini has paid an average of $78 a year in property taxes on tracts of land his namesake companies bought for $1.7 million.Now the real estate company he heads as president, Mancini Realty, is marketing two vacant lots and three large, elaborate homes, some with elevators and rooftop decks. The tax bills are estimated by the realty company to be $9,000 a year on each property on West Judith Avenue — for the new owners. Long Beach Island is widely considered a gem of East Coast real estate where homes are in high demand.New homes in demand on Long Beach IslandHad Mancini paid taxes on the value assessed at the purchase price of $1.7 million for all 14 lots he and his development company, Mancini Custom Homes, owns, the bill would have come to about $14,400 per year. But the lots were deemed unbuildable, so Mancini saw bargain basement property taxes due to assessments of between $600 and $800 per lot — even after one five-bedroom, 2,700-square-foot house was built this year on 11 West Judith Ave. That's a property tax of $5.58 per lot, or about the price of a Big Mac, fries and a soda.The average property tax for a homeowner in the township last year was $7,581.Experts say the low assessments on Mancini's lots are within the boundaries of New Jersey's complex land tax regulations, which inevitably cost towns precious tax dollars."It is a typical move of somebody who's a real estate investor," said Marc Pfeiffer, assistant director and research fellow at the Bloustein Local Government Research Center at Rutgers University. "That's what real estate investors do: They look for those plays and they take a risk."In an email, Mancini, 64, said he was "not interested" in being interviewed for this story. "Good luck...," he added.Buy Photo (Photo:

)Mancini is listed as president of Mancini Realty and Mancini Custom Homes. Tom Coleman, Long Beach Township's attorney, said Mancini "doesn't have an ownership interest" in the real estate company, but does in the custom home company. Mancini runs the day-to-day operations of the companies, Coleman said. Coleman, though, said he is not Mancini's personal attorney.But Mancini also lists himself in a June 2014 township financial disclosure form as the full owner of five West Judith properties, including the one built at 11 West Judith that was on the market for $1.1 million.He has been mayor since 2008. His father, James J. Mancini, held the same position from 1964 until his death in 2003.Mancini or Mancini Custom Homes are listed in property records as owners of 14 lots on West Judith, purchases made over the last decade.The tax assessor, Tracy Hafner, has said that the low assessments were, or are, due to the lots being deemed by the town's zoning to be unbuildable at 40- by 75-feet each.Although the New Jersey tax assessor's handbook says that "property must be assessed on the basis of price," New Jersey's constitutional provisions require "uniformity of property taxation," Pfeiffer said. So changing a property's assessment based on an individual sale "could create inequities with adjoining parcels that may be similar, but didn't sell," he said.Lots on West Judith have changed hands several times the last decade. Records show that Mancini Realty first purchased five, non-contiguous lots on Judith in 2001. In December 2012, the company sold the lots to Mancini Custom Homes for $1 million, according to public records.Mancini Realty purchased another three lots in 2003 for $180,000, according to records. But in May 2013, Mancini Custom Homes purchased another four lots for $506,667, joining the non-contiguous lots into one, long swath, according to records. That made each single unbuildable 40- by 75-foot lot buildable as a single, giant lot, since each adjoining lot now touched the other and was owned by one company.Read "New homes in demand on LBI"Mancini or his companies are listed on Long Beach's tax accounting website as the owner of another two lots on Judith, for a total of 14, but sale prices and dates were not available.Coleman said the lots were consolidated by deed when they were purchased.By New Jersey statute, he said, the assessor, Hafner, had one year to do an added assessment on the properties. Adding the assessment in October, as Hafner did, "absolutely does" fall within that timeframe, he said.Hafner has said that she got behind on updating assessments on Judith, but that bills for added assessments "just went out." She said in an email on Oct. 22 that 14 properties on Judith were given added assessments."I'm by myself," she said last week. "We're short-handed."Coleman added that Hafner has about two years' worth of added assessments sitting in her office due to the damage by superstorm Sandy."It's not like — and I say this respectfully — she's got nothing there to do," Coleman said.A property sale does not trigger a reassessment, either. Pfeiffer said changes in assessment are made when land is subdivided or when an improvement is made to the land — like a house being built. Even then the added value of the property is not immediate, as Mancini's case illustrates.Mancini obtained construction permits through his real estate company for two homes — at 7 and 11 West Judith — in March. The lots must have been combined in order to become buildable, land use experts said, and to accommodate the homes being developed.When lots are combined to make them buildable for new homes, "the value of that land goes up," said Bernard Haney, the tax assessor in Neptune. Tax assessors update their rolls every January, though, so there is often a lag reflecting that new value, Haney said."Essentially we start working in the following year as soon as the new year hits. That's statewide, that is assessment law, so that's not unique to any one municipality. Is there dollars that are lost by the fact that we're in the following year? Absolutely," Haney said. "Is there a better avenue to do it? I will tell you I have been doing this for 25 years and I haven't found one yet."The home at 11 West Judith was built and on the market for $1.1 million for several weeks over the summer but still reflected an assessment of $600. When the Press inquired with assessor Hafner in September about the low assessments, she said that her office was busy and short-handed, but that bills would get added assessments. The home was removed from listings in October. Its tax bill was also adjusted from $5.77 a year in taxes to $5,241.29, but still showed an assessment in public records of $600.The proposed home at 7 West Judith is still on the market, for $1.1 million, and is expected to be ready for January, according to Mancini's website. Like its neighbor, the home's tax bill was adjusted in October from $5.77 a year to $5,241.29, but still showed a land value of $600, according to property records.Mancini is not the only one getting assessments below $1,000. Three other developers who own property on Judith and neighboring streets have received assessments of between $600 and $800 per lot, according to property records.That figure is well below the $271,295 average assessed value of a vacant lot on Long Beach Island. And vacant land is a rare and prized commodity on the 18-mile-long barrier. Empty lots can command soaring prices that reach $2.6 million, according to records, which do not delineate whether land is buildable.Hafner — who was reappointed last year by Mancini and the town's two commissioners to a four-year term and also serves as Beach Haven's assessor — said in an email that "property is assessed 'as is and where is' regardless of ownership or other accusations you make." She was paid $89,080 last year as Long Beach Township's assessor, according to public records."There are 12,000 parcels in both towns combined," she continued, "and each parcel is valued based on State of NJ driven tables that do not fluctuate by owner."There were nearly 203,000 vacant properties throughout New Jersey at the end of the summer. Of those, a little more than 28,000 were assessed between $0 and $600, according to an Asbury Park Press analysis of property records. Long Beach Township, the largest municipality on Long Beach Island, had the most vacant properties on the island in 2014, with 1,089, according to records. Of those, 316 were assessed at $600, for a total tax value of $189,600.With the exception of three properties in Beach Haven, none of the five other towns that make up Long Beach Island has properties assessed so low. The next lowest amount for a vacant property on the island is $4,100, in Surf City, according to property records.Even if a lot is considered unbuildable and may need a number of costly permits, an assessment of less than $1,000 per lot is considered by experts to be a bargain, but not out of line. It is also risky to purchase unbuildable lots because there is no guarantee they can be built on if they are combined, or if various permits, which can be costly, will be issued.There is no consensus among experts, though, whether a $600 assessment for property on land on the southern tip of Long Beach Island, within walking distance to the beach, is the most accurate figure.As Gary S. Forshner, a land use attorney in Lawrenceville, put it, assessing land is "80 percent science, 20 percent an art form.""They probably, if I had to guess, were underassessed at that point, because of exactly what occurred in this case. If you can consolidate those lots and they're in common control or ownership, they're worth a lot more" than the assessed value of $600."It's possible it's nothing more from an assessment perspective, (than) an oversight," Forshner added. "If those lots were unbuildable and someone said 'OK, they're unbuildable, I'll assess them at 600 bucks a piece,' (they) probably didn't really consider the highest and best use, which would be to consolidate the lots and build them."
