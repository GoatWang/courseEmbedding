an expat in US ?

 Post thumbnail



An expat in US? The first time I thought about this is when I was going to university. Before I went to Arizona, I actually have never gone into the US. I only heard and saw from internet about American. When I was searching about it there are articles about racist in US and so on. Well those kind of article kind a freaks me out. I’m afraid that I will be lonely there. Since I’m Mexican I thought maybe they didn’t like me because I’m not white. But when I went to Arizona, nothing that what I was thinking about happen. In Arizona everyone is so nice to me even if they knew that I was Mexican. At the university I got lots of friends from us and even some that isn’t from the US too. An expat just like me. After what happen in Arizona I realize that not all American are racist well maybe there are but not all of them. There’s still nice people there. Being an expat in America have it’s benefits and difficulties. The food and drink in the US is available at very low prices, especially fast food and there is no shortage of restaurants and food outlets. Clothes, utilities and electrical goods are also cheap.
The USA does not have an official language, but English is the most commonly spoken language and is used by government and federal agencies. But there’s actually a large percentage of the population in America speaks Spanish. This is a direct result of the influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants from across the border.
When it comes to the weather, the US is so large that different parts of the country experience different weather patterns. Much of the eastern coast is plagued by hurricanes and monsoons between August and October; however the weather the rest of the year is very pleasant. States in the deep south experience hot, muggy temperatures with little rain while those states and cities further north have a much more temperate climate with four distinct seasons.

Maintain your health from your food

 Post thumbnail



As a nutritionists, I will give you some tips about what you should eat and shouldn’t and why. So remember, what you eat is what you are. About food, there are many different types of food around the world with different types of material like meat, rice, vegetables, dairy product and many more. Of course all of this base material is healthy for our body. But if you eat one of it too much, it’s not good for our health. In life there’s always a balance between good and bad, life and dead, and so does with food. In food it needs balance too between carbohydrate, fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, and calcium for the body. It needs to balance in order to have a healthy and fit body. The choices we made about what are going to eat is very important to our body. We should add up to a balanced, nutritious diet. We all have different calorie needs based on our gender, age, and activity level. Health conditions can play a role too, including if you need to lose weight. So even if it just a small choices it may have a great impact for us.
Having a healthy diet has a lot of benefits. It can help you lose weight or maintain your desired weight. It also can lower your cholesterol and prevent certain health conditions. In general, a healthy diet keeps your body running on a daily basis. 
So remember always choose the best food for you and keep it balance between the meat, potato, veggies, fruit and milk.

Relieving stress in New Orleans

 Post thumbnail



In New Orleans there are lots of ways to relief stress after working. One of it is to listen to music. For me who came from Cuba the music here and there is different. But I like it though. Here IN New Orleans there’s jazz festival. It is held during the last weekend of April and the first weekend of May, this world-renowned extravaganza of music, food, crafts and good living is a mainstay of the New Orleans festival calendar, attracting both international headliners and local artists.
New Orleans is the hometown of jazz, but neither the city nor the genre she birthed are musical museum pieces. Jazz is the root of American popular music, the daddy of rock, brother of the blues and not too distant ancestor of hip-hop – all styles of music that have defined the beat of global pop for decades. All these varieties of music, plus a few you may never have heard of, are practiced and played here on every corner, in any bar, every night of the week. Live music isn’t an event: it’s as crucial to the city soundscape as the streetcar bells.
I am not exaggerating when I say there is either a festival or a parade every week of the year in New Orleans. Sometimes, such as during Mardi Grass or Jazz Fest, it feels like there’s a new party for every hour of the day. At almost any celebration in town, people engage in masking and use a costume while acting out the satanic side of human behavior.

The importance of having an insurance

 Post thumbnail



As an expat, Insurance is absolutely critical and should be one of your top considerations when moving overseas. The majority of countries around the world do not offer expatriates free healthcare, even in emergencies, and rising medical costs around the world entail that a comprehensive international health insurance plan is a must for anyone who is going to move overseas. Such a thing is necessary to ensure coverage in the if an emergency occurs and it is crucial that all expats take the necessary action to make sure that their health and well-being is protected and provided.
I consider the type of policies that are on the market and highlight some of the areas expats should investigate before taking out a medical or travel insurance policy. It is also needed to provide a glossary of important terms so that you can read and understand your contract before you formally agree to the terms and conditions.
If you, or any member of your family has a special medical condition that requires specialist help then you need to ensure that this help will be available in your host country. Again, this should be done before you find yourself living in a strange country with no access to the medical attention you need.
It is always advisable to visit the doctor before you leave your home country and have a full check up. Ensure your vaccinations are up to date and that you are in good health. You should also pay a visit to the dentist and ensure that your teeth are healthy and in good order.
So be careful in choosing the right insurance there are a lot of choices that you can do and please read the policy. Every policy is important so make sure to read all of it and search if there’s any strange or unwanted policy in the contract.

MacroCure Ltd. is a biotechnology company. The Company is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing cell therapy products to address unmet needs for the treatment of chronic wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs). Its product candidate, CureXcell, is a combination of living human white blood cells that have been activated to facilitate the healing process and stimulate wound closure. CureXcell is in Phase III. Its CureXcell addresses each phase of healing in the impaired wound, including the production of growth factors and other biochemical factors involved in fibroblast activation, cell migration and extracellular matrix production, stimulating the body's natural healing process. Its delivery method of direct superficial injection into the chronic wound allows the precise delivery of the cells into the defective wound tissue where they can be effective.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree
