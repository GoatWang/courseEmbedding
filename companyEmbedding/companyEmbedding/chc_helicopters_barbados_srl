Offshore Expertise That Runs Wide & Deep
Decades of over-water flying in extremely demanding conditions have honed unmatched knowledge, skill—and leadership—in offshore transportation for companies that discover and produce oil and natural gas. Each year, our people carry more than one million passengers to and from the ships and platforms that make up their offshore workplaces.
Today, deepwater and ultra-deepwater reserves represent the vast majority of the world's new oil and gas discoveries, overwhelmingly in places where we have well-established capabilities: off the coasts of Australia, Brazil, Norway, the United Kingdom and several nations in Africa.
As our customers continue to go further to explore and produce oil and gas, CHC's world-class, advanced fleet, innovative technology and global reach make us uniquely able to understand and safely meet their needs.
