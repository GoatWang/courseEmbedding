Cards
For more than 100 years, Hallmark has been proudly producing greeting cards to help you say just the right thing for any occasion. Celebrate your favorite holidays with our variety of Christmas cards, Valentine’s Day cards, among others. Mark a life milestone with cards for graduations, engagements and wedding showers, baby showers and baptisms, First Communions and confirmations, or perhaps a promotion or retirement. Birthdays are always in season at Hallmark, and so are those everyday “just because” moments. Or let a loved one know you care during the hard times, with sympathy cards, get-well cards or thinking-of-you cards. Whatever the occasion or event, Hallmark will gladly help you find the right way to show you care.
If you’re looking for something more specific, we have several collections to fit the recipient! The Shoebox greeting card collection is fully of funny greeting cards for all occasions. Our Hallmark Signature collection features beautifully crafted, sophisticated cards. Our Mahogany card collection celebrates the boldness and beauty of African-American culture. Hallmark’s VIDA line of cards embodies the Latino spirit and offers a variety of Spanish-language cards. The Studio INK card collection is witty, trendy and vibrant, for when you need a more creative way to say what you mean. For uplifting, faith-based cards, our DaySpring card line offers a variety of inspiring options. We also offer special artist collections throughout the year, so be sure to browse our seasonal selections.
Don’t forget to search for your loved one’s favorite characters, as well. Our selection features Snoopy and the rest of the Peanuts® gang, Maxine, Marvel superheroes, and characters from Star Wars™, Disney and more.
If you want to add your own photos or are looking for something more personalized, go ahead and visit our online custom card design shop, Ink & Main.
No matter the occasion or the recipient, Hallmark is proud to be your family-owned partner in showing you care.

Hallmark believes that story time is special and offers a variety of storybooks for children that help elevate the experience. From books that play music to those that inspire imaginations and let a child become a part of the story, kids will love reading and discovering new worlds of adventure in the pages of a Hallmark storybook.

Personalized Books – Inspire a child's imagination by making them a part of the story and bringing their dreams to life with the new Personalized Books from Hallmark. The books let you add your child's name and make the main character of the book look like your child by choosing the gender, hairstyle, eye color and skin color. The likeness of your child will appear on every page of the book, including the cover. There are 15 different titles to choose from for both boys and girls, including two books available in Spanish, with more titles on the way. Personalized Books from Hallmark were introduced in 2015.


Be a Part of the Story® – Hallmark's unique line of interactive storybooks lets kids have a conversation with the storybook's main characters and move the story forward. The Be a Part of the Story collection features Hallmark's exclusive I Reply® technology. When highlighted lines are read aloud, the character chimes in with a special question or choice for a child to answer. Once the child answers, the character responds and the story continues. Your child can help Mickey Mouse on a treasure hunt, Batman capture the Joker, and Cinderella have a special ball. Each book has more than 30 possibilities, so each time you read the book together, it will feel like a whole new story time experience. 


ColorQuest™ Books – In these fun new interactive book and character sets, children will love discovering what the character in the book is thinking as they go on their adventures. When the child places the character on a colored spot, the character magically chimes in to talk about what's happening and add to the story. Seasonal titles are available as well as everyday titles including Mickey's Boat Race and Minnie's Island Adventure which are designed to work together. ColorQuest Books were introduced by Hallmark in 2014.


Lights On Lights Out Storybooks – Lights On Lights Out Storybooks are a gentle bedtime ritual that encourages readers to help story characters go to sleep by prompting the reader to turn out the lights. Each book features a scene at the top with lights that you can turn on and off at the press of a button. Each button turns off the corresponding lights in the display, and once all the lights in the display are off, a magical glow appears for a few minutes while the child falls asleep. Titles including The Dream Machine and Nighty-Night Campsite add a bit of magic to bedtime. Lights Out Storybooks were introduced in 2015.


Musical Puzzle Stories – Combining stories, songs and puzzles, 3 of children's favorites, Musical Puzzle Stories delight children and parents alike. As mom reads the story, the child selects the correct puzzle piece to place on the corresponding page in the book. When the puzzle piece is inserted, the character sings a portion of the song and helps to move the story along. When the last page of the story is read and the last puzzle piece is placed, every character joins in to sing the finale. Titles include Spaceman Dan's Adventure, Maddy & the Undersea Sparklefest and The Noise at the Top of the Tree. Musical Puzzle Stories were introduced in 2015.


Recordable Storybooks from Hallmark – Even if grandpa lives in another state or mommy is away at work, children can share meaningful moments with their loved ones by reading with them – whenever or wherever they want. Exclusive voice-capture technology enables a person to record each page of a book and have it played back over and over as the recipient turns the pages. The recording will not be lost, even when the batteries need to be replaced. There are currently more than 20 different Recordable Storybook titles including literary classics like Guess How Much I Love You and Goodnight Moon as well as Hallmark original titles like That's What Grandmas Do! and Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep. There are also seasonal titles available. Hallmark introduced Recordable Storybooks in September 2009 and consumer response to the initial offering was so strong that they virtually sold out.


Seasonal Picture Books – More than stories, Hallmark Gift Books are meaningful ways to show your loved ones you know just what they need to hear. Hallmark creates traditional seasonal books at Valentine's Day, Easter, Halloween, and Christmas that pair nicely with other gift and plush product year-round.


Touch Sensitive Books – Inspired by the intuitive nature of touchscreen technology, Touch Sensitive Books allow children to use a swipe of their finger to interact with the book's pages. When they swipe along the arrows of each page, children will hear fun sounds that bring the action of the story to life. Touch Sensitive Books Intergalactic Treasure Hunt and Ava the Animal Rescuer! were introduced in 2015.


You're the Star™ of the Story – Any child can be a superhero with You're the Star™ of the Story Book and Costume Bundles. Whether kids read the books together with mom or dad, or spend time in pretend play, these books and magic capes make reading and play a lot more fun. The interactive cape medallion responds with sound effects and music when highlighted phrases in the book are read or the catch phrases are said. You're the Star of the Story was introduced in 2014.

In Stores
Hallmark Gift Books are available online at Hallmark.com, at Hallmark Gold Crown® stores nationwide, and at many other retailers that sell the Hallmark brand. Use the store locator on Hallmark.com to find the nearest Hallmark Gold Crown store.

	Facts


Introduced in 1986 shortly after the launch of Hallmark’s Shoebox card line, Maxine has entertained millions with her feisty, insightful, and hilarious observations on life. The character has appeared on everything from greeting cards to books to popular Hallmark gifts.Maxine follows current news, trends and popular culture with an eagle eye and has an opinion about pretty much everything. Her irreverent quips about aging, the workplace, technology and political correctness strike a chord with fans, especially professional, college-educated women aged 35-65. But it’s clear that Maxine appeals to anyone with attitude. Fans say they love her because, "Maxine says the things I wish I could say."Maxine cards have consistently rated among Hallmark’s highest selling alternative humor cards, with millions (and millions) being sold since 1986. Over a million Maxine books, in several titles, have been sold since 2006. One classic title, It’s Not Menopause...I’m Just Like This, has sold more than 400,000 copies.  Maxine's Agin’ and Ragin’! book is also the number three seller in Hallmark's book line. And in spite of Maxine’s age, she’s still with it, including being on top of the online trends of today. With over 2 million active fans on Facebook, Maxine is a social media star these days, ensuring her a growing base of younger devotees who just like her sass.  Maxine’s comic feature, Crabby Road, is posted daily both on her Facebook page and on her website, Maxine.com. Maxine’s special Breaking News features also appear regularly on Facebook, giving her the chance to comment on up-to-the-minute bonehead stunts of celebrities and politicians, or on the quirks of modern life in general. Maxine also has appeared on YouTube and has her own line of e-cards.

Product News

The bright lights of Branson, Mo. are set to shine on a brand new star of the stage, although there's a good chance she might find a reason to complain about them. During the 2016 Christmas season, Maxine, Hallmark Cards' self-appointed "Queen of Crabbiness," will star in "Maxine's Christmas Carol", a twist on the Charles Dickens' classic holiday story, "A Christmas Carol." The live-action musical is getting the full Maxine treatment and will feature ghosts, songs, plenty of attitude, and even a role for Maxine's dog Floyd. 
Maxine’s likeness and attitude are so popular that she’s become one of the stars of Hallmark Licensing, with a diverse lineup of companies using the Maxine character. The Maxine page-a-day calendar is the number one selling calendar for Mead. She also appears on popular crafting fabrics for Robert Kaufmann and her designs are available on print-on-demand apparel and mugs at Zazzle.com.
Hallmark's own creative staff constantly innovates new concepts for Maxine, with formats including Cards With Motion, interactive cards and push-button Cards With Sound featuring Maxine’s voice. 
Maxine has also been featured on a number of humorous Hallmark gifts including a Bunco game, wine coasters and bunny slippers. Maxine also has her wisdom published in a number of book titles including It's Not Menopause...I'm Just Like This and Agin' and Ragin'! All products are available in Hallmark Gold Crown® stores, and most of the gifts are priced at less than $15.
In August 2015, Maxine reached 1.8 million fans of Facebook. Check out her page here.  

Character History
Hallmark artist John Wagner created Maxine in 1986 based on his mother, grandmother and maiden aunts while he was the first art studio manager for Shoebox Greetings. The new card line was trying to attract hip, young card senders with fresh female characters. He thought the line needed an older character too, just like the smart and funny women who helped raise him. So with a few passes of his pen he created the no-nonsense grouch who would be known for years only as “John’s old lady.” (Watch a video of John Wagner speaking about his mother's influence on the crabby character.)
Maxine was born. Her first card sold well, so Wagner drew more of them. He added the spot-on details of an outspoken, loveable curmudgeon that have become Maxine’s trademarks, from her chemically tortured hair, aviator shades, and perpetual snarl, right down to her housecoat and bunny slippers. He gave her a canine best friend, Floyd, who plays her straight man without saying a word.
Soon Wagner’s mom got involved. Toni Wagner, who helped inspire the character, was a willing conspirator in Maxine’s publicity boom. Toni began dressing up as Maxine and attending special events at Hallmark Gold Crown stores and nursing homes throughout New England, where she lived.
Maxine was featured in a 1995 People magazine article alongside Toni and John. From then until her death 10 years later, Toni took on the Maxine persona in countless interviews with national and local media. These days professional Kansas City actor Cathy Barnett dons the garb to play Maxine for special occasions, such as Keepsake Ornament Club events and events around Kansas City.
For more than a quarter century Maxine has been popular for the way she channels everyone’s pet peeves. But in these times of change and uncertainty, her fearless quips especially resonate with both genders and all ages. As one online fan recently put it, “Maxine is a walking bottle of truth serum.”
In Stores
Maxine greeting cards are available wherever Hallmark products are sold. Maxine gifts can be found in Hallmark Gold Crown® stores. Use the store locator on Hallmark.com to find the nearest Hallmark Gold Crown® store.

	Facts


The Mahogany brand from Hallmark provides the most extensive offering of cards available for African-American consumers.The top five markets for Hallmark Mahogany card sales are: 1) Washington, D.C., 2) New York, 3) Chicago, 4) Philadelphia, 5) Atlanta.With 42 million people, African Americans account for 13.6 percent of the total U.S. population. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, The Black Population: 2010)Hallmark began offering cards relevant for African Americans in the 1960s and introduced the Mahogany line in 1987.

Product Features 

Hallmark Mahogany features everyday and seasonal cards to help African Americans honor their relationships in innovative, compelling and culturally-relevant ways. The line features cards appropriate for both adults and children. 
Mahogany offers cards for several seasons – Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, graduation, Christmas and Kwanzaa – as well as a full range of everyday occasions, such as birthday, thinking of you, get well, wedding, anniversary, sympathy and more. The line also includes Christmas boxed cards.  
Sentiments range from deeply religious to lightly spiritual, from poetic and sophisticated to casual and humorous. Authentic language and themes reflect the diverse culture, families and relationships. 

Product History
Mahogany is a personal expression brand that provides an authentic and engaging experience for African-Americans and those inspired by African-American culture. The card line exists to enhance emotional connections between family, friends and the community by capturing what's most beloved and valued about African-American culture.
Hallmark has been creating cards that speak to African-American culture since the 1960s. The company first introduced the Mahogany name in 1987 as a 16-card promotion. Mahogany became a year-round brand offering both everyday and seasonal cards in 1991.
Through the years, Mahogany has collaborated with well-known African-Americans such as Maya Angelou, T.D. Jakes and Iyanla Vanzant. The brand also partnered with the U.S. Postal Service in 1999 to celebrate the accomplishments of African Americans in history through the Legacy of Greatness cards that coordinated with the collectible postage stamps of the same name.
Connect with Mahogany on Hallmark.com, Facebook and Instagram.
In Stores
Available at Hallmark Gold Crown® stores nationwide and wherever Hallmark Mahogany products are sold. Use the store locator on Hallmark.com to find the nearest store.

	Facts


Shoebox is the nation's number one brand of humor cards and the home of funny at Hallmark Gold Crown® stores and other Hallmark retailers since 1986.In a 2012 EquiTrend study, Shoebox had the second-highest greetings brand equity behind Hallmark, as rated on familiarity, quality, and purchase intent — above all others in the industry.Saturdays cards, found at Walmart stores and in Expressions from Hallmark retailers, share the same creative point of view as Shoebox, and the same team of Hallmark's funniest writers and artists.Shoebox and Saturdays cards are quick, unexpected, casual, conversational, and sometimes edgy. Intended for peer-to-peer, adult sending, these funny cards provide a range of humor styles, from laugh-out-loud to smart to soft for a variety of relationships. They feature relevant, on-trend content, distinctive illustrations, and eye-catching photography.Hallmark’s traditional humor cards, as distinguished from Shoebox, tend to be more slapstick, family-friendly, silly, safe and timelessly funny. The humor is inclusive, easy-to-understand, and positive.


Recently, Hallmark's Shoebox line of greeting cards deepened its rebellious roots with a total brand overhaul. From the logo to the sentiments, the entire collection has been updated with a modern look and features language reflecting today's world in an irreverent and hilarious way."Shoebox has always been a one-stop humor destination for funny cards," says Sarah Tobaben, humor creative strategist at Hallmark. "To stay relevant, we made sure to focus the new cards in a way that reflects how people today talk, text, tweet and post."The new collection can be found at participating Hallmark retailers nationwide as well as online at Hallmark.com. Card prices begin at $2.99. 
Connect with Shoebox via the blog, and on Facebook and Twitter.

 
Other Humor News

The focus for Shoebox and Saturdays humor cards is on providing continually fresh and funny content for humor fans. No matter how often consumers visit the display, they will find something new, whether it's a collection that showcases the latest design trends, topical references, or unique takes on getting older, friendships, and celebrating.
Hallmark's traditional humor cards focus on safer, sweeter, sillier humor with broad appeal, making the cards appropriate for cross-generational sending. 
Innovation continues to be an emphasis for Hallmark’s traditional humor, including a variety of Cards With Sound and Motion. Traditional humor features a variety of formats, sizes, and prices, which allows for fun and interesting applications of licensed properties, attachments and paper mechanics.
The Shoebox line consists of more than 500 cards for birthdays, anniversaries, friendship, congratulations, and many other occasions and holidays.

Maxine — The Queen of Crabby is still going strong since Hallmark introduced the character in 1986. She has more than a million Facebook fans, who continue to seek out her irreverent quips about aging, the workplace, retirement, politics and current events. Maxine cards can be found in the traditional humor line.
hoops&yoyo™ — These Hallmark characters – a pink kitty and green bunny – are an international hit. hoops&yoyo are silly, high-energy, and loved by kids and adults. The collection focuses on innovative formats, including Cards With Sound and Motion and "dueling-speakers" cards that let the irrepressible characters talk (or sing!) back-and-forth to each other.
