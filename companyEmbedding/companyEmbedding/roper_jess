President and Founder



Jess helps business owners create the financial information they need to make sound business decisions. Since forming her firm in 1993, she has worked with manufacturers, attorneys, healthcare providers, retailers, realtors, contractors, and other service providers to fine tune their accounting and teach them to understand the numbers for their business. According to a client, “Jess exceeded everything and made it so simple. Jess has allowed me to think about my finances in a different way.” Prior to starting Roper, Jess was a senior officer in banking and insurance for close to 20 years. She currently teaches small business workshops for area community colleges and SCORE and has served as president and is the current treasurer of the Raleigh Chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners and the North Raleigh Civitan Club. Jess graduated from East Carolina University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Math then attended North Carolina State University for post-graduate accounting courses. She also attended the BAI School of Banking, a three-year program at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
Jess is an avid hockey fan. When she is not working, she and her husband enjoy attending Carolina Hurricanes games and visiting their two favorite places, Beaufort (NC) and their home in the NC mountains.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

BBB Rating System Overview

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Zappos.com has received 4.67 out of 5 stars based on 8 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
