JikoPower In The News







 The Challenge







1.5 Billion People Do Not Have Access to Electricity.







80% of Kenyans Have Cellphones, But Only 20% Have Electricity.







1.3 Billion Burn Kerosene for Light, Emitting 270,000 Tonnes of CO2.







Our Solution The JikoPower SparkThe JikoPower Spark captures wasted heat from a cookstove or fire and turns it into electricity to charge cellphones, LED lights, and other small devices. It is built to survive your greatest adventure or the wear and tear of everyday use. High-Grade Aluminum AlloySolid StatePower Output of 2-5 WattsHeat Tolerance of 600˚C






The Spark Starter Kit. Fully Funded on Kickstarter!



















Pilots







Kenya & UgandaJuly 2016: JikoPower's two week journey through Kenya and Uganda was incredible! We met with partners, held demonstrations, assessed market and customer needs, and solidified distribution networks, in 6 key areas of Kenya and Uganda.  The JikoPower Spark was met with overwhelming enthusiasm by customers, distributors, partners and the community.  Salim, from ACON in Bongoma, Kenya, and Simeon, from Project Stoke based out of Kisumu, Kenya, are over seeing the distribution and use of 50 Spark prototypes. Over the course of the trip, hundreds of people signed up to purchase the JikoPower Spark and many have already made their first payment.







Kenya, AfricaFebruary 2017: President and CEO, Ryan Ahearn returned from a successful three week trip to Kenya in February. He met with non-profits, microfinance agencies, impact investment groups and distributors. During his visit, Ryan was able to explore financing options for our customers, locate office space in Nairobi, tour in-country manufacturing, follow up with our existing partners and make valuable connections.







 Our Impact






Nathan Elisha in Gabon with City University Enactus



Gabon, AfricaMarch 2016:  JikoPower sent multiple early stage generators with City University Enactus students over to Gabon, Africa for initial testing and customer feedback. In the first month of ownership, people are not only saving time and money, but one woman has doubled her income by selling cellphone charges to her community. This means that members of her community no longer have to walk to distant towns for more expensive charging.On June 7th, a new and improved prototype of the JikoPower Spark was brought to Nigeria with a City University Enactus student. 






Salim Mayeki Shaban in his home in Bungoma, Kenya



Bungoma, KenyaAugust/ September 2016: There was an extended power outage in Bungoma, Kenya. According to our partner Salim, our customers were the only residents with consistent access to electricity in the entire area. They used the JIkoPower Spark prototypes to charge neighbors' phones. Users have reported charging times of two hours per phone. This is significantly faster than we had predicted for these initial prototypes. The next generation should charge even faster! 







Economic GrowthWith the JikoPower Spark, people save time and money. They can grow businesses by staying connected with clients and suppliers. Others can sell charges to their local community and earn extra money for their families.







EducationFamilies can afford to send their children to school instead of to work. Kids can stay up studying by LED at night, and if they have a question they can call or look it up on a cellphone.







ENVIRONMENTWith a generator, people are 3X more likely to use a clean cook stove, and with access to electricity, families aren't dependent on kerosene for light. This dramatically reduces their carbon footprint and improves respiratory health.







HEALTHWith electricity and a charged cellphone, families can easily reach a doctor, and doctors can more effectively serve their communities. They can offer advice over the phone, and can work after dark.

FAQs — JikoPower



































































 .



Frequently Asked QuestionsQ. What is Kickstarter?Kickstarter is a website where people see interesting new projects/products and help fund them by pre-ordering or pledging money to their creators. Their pledge supports making that product possible. The project must reach its funding goal with in a limited time period, usually 30-60 days. Credit cards are not charged until a project reaches its funding goal and manufacturing begins. If the goal is not met, nobody is charged and the creators do not get any funding. In most cases this means the project dies, but many try again.Our How To Use Kickstarter Video: https://youtu.be/dF0cjLd-X3gQ. How does the Spark work?Thermoelectric generators, or TEGs, rely on thermoelectric chips that convert heat into electricity.  The thermoelectric chips generate the most electricity when the disparity between the temperatures on either side of the chip is the greatest. Our generator gathers heat through the arm on one side of the chip and the water in the reservoir keeps the other side cool.  The water can be boiling and still be considered cool relative to the side with the metal arm.Q. Why thermoelectric?Our device uses heat that is otherwise wasted when people are cooking. It is used while cooking or enjoying a fire, so it can’t be easily stolen.  It is very durable; perfect for rural lifestyles or camping. It also doesn't rely on the weather or time of day to function.Q. Where did you get this idea?Marilyn, our founder Ryan’s mom, was working as an aid worker in Haiti after the earthquake and tsunami. While she was there she was treating a young boy about Ryan’s age. He was injured in the earthquake and needed medical supplies that were roughly 10 miles away.  Marilyn rushed around to see if anyone could call for the supplies.  Although almost everyone had a cellphone no one had a charge.  The little boy didn’t make it and his death had a lasting impression on Marilyn and Ryan.  They learned that this scenario happens all over the world all the time. Now Ryan is all grown up and has a son of his own. His mission is to make sure that something as simple as charging a cell phone never again leads to the pain his mother felt, or a child’s entirely preventable death.JikoPower Inc.3205 C STREET NORTHEAST, AUBURN, WA, 98002

Women in Energy and Environmental TechnologyDr. Mbaari Kinya is the founder of WEET and is well connected in the Nairobi educational and financial community and has over twenty-five years experience in the renewable energy field. WEET is a market-based social enterprise whose mission is to provide poor women from urban slums and rural areas with engineering and entrepreneurial skills. The program includes a component of mindset deconstruction to eliminate historic and cultural barriers that hinder women from effectively involving themselves in engineering and business endeavors.







ACONACON has developed sustainable clean cookstoves, out of clay and local scrap metal, and is pursuing integration with the JikoPower generator with their stoves. Through an indigenous rotating finance model, ACON works with low income village women to sell their cookstoves. They have a strong presence in Kenya and have successfully sold over 20,000 clean cookstoves in the Kisumu area over the last five years. 







Project StokeProject Stoke is run by STAMP, a clean cookstove manufacturer located in Kisii and Kisumu. Through its design, their stove produces less smoke during startup, and emits almost no smoke as it burns.  This reduces respiratory and visual illnesses that traditional stove smoke causes. As most mothers cook alongside their babies, this stove decreases infant death and alleviates health issues related to smoke for the rest of the family. Stoke is increasing employment in an area where employment, especially well-paying work, is often difficult to find.







AWAMU Biomass Energy AWAMU is a startup social enterprise in Uganda that manufactures and distributes clean cooking TLUD gasifier stoves and processed biomass fuels. They work with local stakeholders to promote a low cost, locally produced and highly efficient clean cooking solution for less privileged communities in Uganda. It targets rural and peri-urban households that still have access to biomass fuels like wood, agricultural biomass and can process fuels. Their mission is to manufacture and distribute the clean cooking gasifier stove that utilizes renewable energy from dry biomass, while increasing household incomes, reducing indoor air pollution and mitigating climate change.
