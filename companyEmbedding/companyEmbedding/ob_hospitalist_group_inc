The physician component of the OBHG team is not held in high regard. The administration consistently negotiates a raise in reimbursement from the hospital, but will not negotiate a physician pay raise at all2. Benefits package: physicians have not seen a raise in 7 years while the cost of living has continued to rise. health insurance expensive and minimal coverage, no retirement package except what you put in to 401k (18k max/year out of your salary)3. continued escalation of responsibilities despite no pay raise. There continues to be (ever increasing) responsibilities outside of your shift work, it is not a clock in/clock out practice4. Management not responsive to unsafe patient care conditions (too high a volume for one physician to safely manage)Advice to ManagementConstantly reevaluate programs for patient safety and listen to your team if they raise concerns before you become understaffed, not after. Evaluate your retirement package. Tie physician reimbursement to administrative cost increase negotiations. If administration deems it is important enough to pay themselves more, it should be important for physicians too.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Ob Hospitalist Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Ob Hospitalist Group 2017-02-04 11:57 PST 24 Aug 2016 Ob Hospitalist Group Logo"Manager Revenue Cycle Operations"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Mauldin, SC (US)Former Employee - Anonymous Employee in Mauldin, SC (US)I worked at Ob Hospitalist Group full-time (More than 3 years)ProsGreat benefits package including vacation time, 401k match, medical, dental, life, disability.

My manager is great but she does things her own way.ConsCompany was formed with morales and values. Company has taken a turn for the worse under the new management. CEO may be ok but the rest of the leadership team is horrible. HR is based on manipulation, lies and not to be trusted. If you looking for a company that has no respect for their employees and where management is not interested in making sure the company survives then this could be a great job for you. My advice would be that you turn and run as quickly as you can until the company is under new management.Advice to ManagementIt's too late for you to turn the opinions of the employees around.

OBHG tries always to satisfy their customer which is the hospital. This organization is not interested in quality patient care or the working environment of the physician employee. Management is not supportive to physician employees or retention. If the physician is not a good fit for one client hospital, OBHG will not assign the physician to another hospital. You will be fired on a whim. I would not recommend this company for permanent employment.Advice to ManagementScreen potential physicians well. If the employee physician is competent, be supportive. Develop and document your own worker evaluation progress. Do not let your hospital client be the only evaluator of physician performance. Allow the physician to transfer to another hospital..Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Ob Hospitalist Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Ob Hospitalist Group 2016-05-14 18:47 PDT 23 Mar 2016 Helpful (1) Ob Hospitalist Group Logo"Jump on this rocket-ship!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Senior Management in Greenville, SC (US)Former Employee - Senior Management in Greenville, SC (US)RecommendsPositive OutlookI worked at Ob Hospitalist Group full-time (More than a year)ProsGreat atmosphere for personal growth; strong moral ethic; value proposition is unique and enduring; growth potential is outstanding; leadership is committed to the team; balanced guidance from equity partners and the boardConsFrenetic growth can tend to diminish work-life balance; immense change can be unsettling, especially for individuals who need a more predictable path; communication is still an area for improvementAdvice to ManagementEncourage open-minded input for increased quality of life for the team; provide venues for open communication about the direction of the company; support better feedback - positive and negative - between members of the same teamShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Ob Hospitalist Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Ob Hospitalist Group 2016-03-23 16:33 PDT 17 Mar 2016 Ob Hospitalist Group Logo"Wouldn't Recccommend"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Greenville, SC (US)Former Employee - Anonymous Employee in Greenville, SC (US)Doesn't RecommendPositive OutlookI worked at Ob Hospitalist Group (More than a year)ProsGreat benefits and decent compensation.ConsPoor management - oftentimes it seems the wrong people were chosen to lead.
