Personal background[edit]
Theodore John Leonsis was born on January 8, 1957 in Brooklyn, New York. Born to a family of working class Greek immigrant parents and grandparents who were mill workers,[8][9] who worked as a waiter and a secretary.[10] Citing his humble beginnings and working-class background, Leonsis states the highest income they ever earned was $31,000 combined as his dad worked for tips – often received in change – as he worked a counter for breakfast and lunch at a diner and recalling his fathers agony when he lost his job. When his high school guidance counselor evaluated his skillsets, the counselor concluded that young Ted was destined to work in a grocery store.[11] Leonsis also reflects on his working-class roots that being a grocery store manager was all his dad aspired him to be. During his youth, Leonsis mowed lawns for extra money.[12] One day when mowing, he stumbled upon mowing the lawn owned by a wealthy stockbroker and Georgetown alumus named Jim Shannon. Impressed by Leonsis's strong work ethic and cutting the grass with extra care to impress the older gentlemen, he helped Leonsis gain admission into Georgetown University.[11][12]
He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, before moving to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Lowell High School in 1973.[13] In 2005, he was honored as one of Lowell High School's Distinguished Alumni for reaching the highest level of accomplishment and possessing the highest standards of integrity and character. He was first in his family to go to university where he attended Georgetown University to pursue his undergraduate studies majoring in American studies graduating in 1977 at the top of his class.[8][14][15] One of his most memorable college experiences was when he threw himself into a college English project to prove that Ernest Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the Sea" years before the book was published.[11][16] Also during college, Leonsis, with encouragement from a mentor, Reverend Joseph Durkin, used computers and primitive punch cards to his thesis where it introduced him to the potential fortunes that were to be made in the emerging software and personal computer industries of the early 1980s.[16] After graduating from college, he then moved back to his parents' home in Lowell and began working for Wang Laboratories as a corporate communications manager and Harris Corp. as a marketing executive.[13][17][18][19]
Business career[edit]




Leonsis speaking to the Tech Council of Maryland


LIST Magazine[edit]
Leonsis left Harris Corporation in March 1981 when, at the age 25, he moved to Florida and began his first business venture. His first venture was publishing LIST, a technology magazine that focused on the then personal computing industry.[20] He raised $1 million in seed capital with his partner Vincent Pica,[21] while working numerous toiling nights to keep the magazine publishing company afloat. The magazine sent ripples in the software world where it was recognized as an essential service for buyers and sellers of hardware and software. Numerous software vendors sought the magazine to promote their products and services which resulted Leonsis selling advertising to them based on a Yellow Pages business model. The first issue of the magazine was a success and sold $50,000 worth of copies when the magazine first got published in the fall of 1982 and was sold near cash registers, bookstores, and newsstands.[20] Just two years later, he sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million netting Leonsis $20 million making him a multimillionaire in the process.[20][22]
AOL[edit]
In 1987, Leonsis established the marketing communications company, Redgate Communications Corporation.[23] When the organization was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1994, Leonsis began working with AOL as a senior executive, remaining with the company for 13 years.[24] Under his leadership, AOL increased its membership from under 800,000 members to over 8 million, while their annual revenue increased from $100 million to $1.5 billion.[25] He held numerous positions at AOL during his years there, completing his tenure and retiring in 2006 as the audience group's president and vice-chairman.[26] As of 2014[update], he serves as vice chairman emeritus of AOL.[citation needed]
Monumental Sports & Entertainment[edit]
Leonsis is the founder, majority owner, chairman and CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the NHL's Washington Capitals, NBA's Washington Wizards, WNBA's Washington Mystics, and the AFL's Washington Valor & Baltimore Brigade. Monumental Sports additionally owns the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.[27] and manages the Kettler Capitals Iceplex and George Mason University's EagleBank Arena.[28] Formed in 2010 by a merger between Leonsis' Lincoln Holdings with Washington Sports & Entertainment, Monumental Sports & Entertainment is the only privately held company in a top-10 market to own and operate three professional sports teams and its arena.[29][30][31] In January 2013 Monumental Sports & Entertainment launched Monumental Network, a digital platform that serves as a hub for Washington's sports and entertainment news.[32] In 2016 a rebranded Monumental Sports Network was launched for digital, mobile and over-the-top platforms.[33] The new Monumental Sports Network offers an OTT service that provides live streaming of Mystics, Valor and AFL Baltimore games as well as additional live events and games. Monumental and CSN Mid-Atlantic formed an advanced media partnership that not only extended CSN’s exclusive media rights to the Capitals and Wizards but also saw Monumental become an equity partner in CSN. Additionally, NBC Sports Group invested in Monumental Sports Network, becoming an equity partner.[34]

Management

Leonsis has a "hands on" approach to management of his sports teams.[35] After purchasing the Wizards, Leonsis criticized the NBA's salary cap at a luncheon with business leaders. He was fined $100,000 by the league, for "unauthorized public comments regarding the league's collective bargaining negotiations."[36] Leonsis has sought to roll-back changes to the Wizards and Capitals franchises that coincided with the opening of the Verizon Center in 1997. In 2007, he changed the Capitals team logo and its colors back to their original red, white, and blue, and in May 2011, received positive responses from media, fans, players and alumni when the Wizards unveiled a similar red, white and blue color scheme, along with uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the team under their former name, the Bullets, when they won the NBA Championship in 1978.[37] Additionally, he had taken under consideration restoring the Bullets name to the franchise,[38] though critics said that this would "send the wrong message" about gun violence in Washington.[39]

Washington Capitals

Leonsis has owned the Washington Capitals since the spring of 1999, and in that timeframe the team has won seven Southeast Division titles, two Presidents’ Trophy and has recorded more than 200 consecutive sellouts at Verizon Center.[31]
In the early years of his ownership, the Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In summer 2001, the Capitals traded for Jaromír Jágr and signed him to what was at the time, the largest contract in NHL history. The trade was enthusiastically well received by fans and over 300 people showed up at Dulles International Airport to greet Jágr when he arrived.[40] After Jágr was traded in 2004, Leonsis was criticized by fans.[41] He was involved in a physical altercation with a fan, who led a mocking chant of Leonsis during the game and hoisted a sign chiding him. In the altercation, Leonsis grabbed and threw the fan to the ground, which also caused a young child to fall to the ground. For his involvement in the scuffle, Leonsis was fined $100,000. He also received a suspension of one week, during which he was prohibited from having any contact with the team.[42] After the incident, Leonsis personally called the fan to apologize for his actions and invited him and his family to watch a game in the owner's box.[43]




Leonsis watches Wizards player John Wall in 2010


In 2009, a season ticket holder informed Leonsis of a homeless man, Scott Lovell, who spent his nights sleeping outside Verizon Center. Leonsis found Lovell a part-time job as a restaurant kitchen worker and provided him with a paid and furnished apartment, a prosthetic leg and Capitals season tickets for life. In return, Lovell vowed to remain clean and sober.[44]
In 2010, journalist Damien Cox, author of the Ovechkin Project, a biography of Alexander Ovechkin, wrote that Leonsis was trying to circumvent the NHL's salary cap when signing Ovechkin's contract.[45] He also alleged that Leonsis was bribing bloggers for positive coverage of the Capitals.[46] Leonsis said that Cox was angry that he did not receive the access to Ovechkin that he wanted and defended his support for the league.[47]
During the 2009–2010 season, the Capitals earned the NHL's President's Trophy as the team that finished with the most points in the league during the regular season.[48]
The 2010–2011 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history, drawing 754,309 fans.[49] The Capitals, like other teams, have raised ticket prices in recent years.[50][51] In 2011, after raising ticket prices for the fourth consecutive year while shrinking the size of beers sold at the Verizon Center, he earned the nickname "Leon$i$".[52] In 2001, Leonsis claimed to have written a computer program that prevented Pittsburgh Penguins fans (the Capitals first-round opponent) from purchasing tickets online. When asked if the actions were unfair, Leonsis stated, "I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it."[53] Again in 2009, he received criticism for preventing visiting team fans from purchasing Capitals playoff tickets.[54]
In the face of community opposition, Leonsis has persisted with a plan to expand the billboards around the Verizon Center.[55] Critics said the signage would make the arena more garish and cheapen DC's Chinatown, Leonsis said it was necessary to raise an additional $20 to 30 million in annual revenue, and a sports expert explained that "an owner saddled with underperforming teams is under greater pressure to find income sources."[56][57][58] Leonsis persevered and in March 2013 construction of the new signs were announced.[57]
In 2013, Leonsis received a letter about Jack Dibler, a lifelong Capitals fan who had recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In response, Leonsis sent Dibler a package that included a signed Alexander Ovechkin jersey and a letter inviting Dibler and his family to a game.[59]

Washington Wizards

Leonsis became the majority owner of the Washington Wizards in June 2010, inheriting a team that had 26 wins and 56 losses during the previous season.[60] Leonsis has taken a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website.[61] On May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms and logo. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years.[62] During Leonsis’ tenure as owner, the Wizards have compiled a promising young nucleus of players, including John Wall (No. 1 pick in the 2010 NBA Draft), Bradley Beal (No. 3 pick in the 2012 NBA Draft) and Otto Porter Jr. (No. 3 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft). They have also acquired veterans like Nenê and Marcin Gortat via trade.[63][64] Leonsis was chairman of the NBA's 2014 media committee that negotiated a nine-year expanded partnership with Turner Broadcasting and The Walt Disney Company.[65]
In February 2016, construction started on a new practice facility for the Wizards.[66] The development was paid for by DC taxpayers and District-funded Events DC while Leonsis' contribution to the $55 million cost was considered ceremonial.[66] The Wizards also announced that they would raise ticket prices for a third consecutive year.[66]

Washington Mystics

Leonsis purchased the rights to the Mystics around the same time he took over the Wizards.

Washington Valor and Baltimore Brigade

On March 10, 2016, Leonsis announced that he was purchasing an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League (AFL) to play at the Verizon Center beginning in 2017. On March 16, 2016, the announcement was made official by AFL commissioner Scott Butera.[67] On July 14, 2016, the team name was revealed as the Washington Valor.[68] On November 14, 2016, Monumental announced that it had acquired an AFL team that would begin play in 2017 in Baltimore.[69] The team name was later revealed as the Baltimore Brigade.

Personal background[edit]
Theodore John Leonsis was born on January 8, 1957 in Brooklyn, New York. Born to a family of working class Greek immigrant parents and grandparents who were mill workers,[8][9] who worked as a waiter and a secretary.[10] Citing his humble beginnings and working-class background, Leonsis states the highest income they ever earned was $31,000 combined as his dad worked for tips – often received in change – as he worked a counter for breakfast and lunch at a diner and recalling his fathers agony when he lost his job. When his high school guidance counselor evaluated his skillsets, the counselor concluded that young Ted was destined to work in a grocery store.[11] Leonsis also reflects on his working-class roots that being a grocery store manager was all his dad aspired him to be. During his youth, Leonsis mowed lawns for extra money.[12] One day when mowing, he stumbled upon mowing the lawn owned by a wealthy stockbroker and Georgetown alumus named Jim Shannon. Impressed by Leonsis's strong work ethic and cutting the grass with extra care to impress the older gentlemen, he helped Leonsis gain admission into Georgetown University.[11][12]
He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, before moving to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Lowell High School in 1973.[13] In 2005, he was honored as one of Lowell High School's Distinguished Alumni for reaching the highest level of accomplishment and possessing the highest standards of integrity and character. He was first in his family to go to university where he attended Georgetown University to pursue his undergraduate studies majoring in American studies graduating in 1977 at the top of his class.[8][14][15] One of his most memorable college experiences was when he threw himself into a college English project to prove that Ernest Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the Sea" years before the book was published.[11][16] Also during college, Leonsis, with encouragement from a mentor, Reverend Joseph Durkin, used computers and primitive punch cards to his thesis where it introduced him to the potential fortunes that were to be made in the emerging software and personal computer industries of the early 1980s.[16] After graduating from college, he then moved back to his parents' home in Lowell and began working for Wang Laboratories as a corporate communications manager and Harris Corp. as a marketing executive.[13][17][18][19]
Business career[edit]




Leonsis speaking to the Tech Council of Maryland


LIST Magazine[edit]
Leonsis left Harris Corporation in March 1981 when, at the age 25, he moved to Florida and began his first business venture. His first venture was publishing LIST, a technology magazine that focused on the then personal computing industry.[20] He raised $1 million in seed capital with his partner Vincent Pica,[21] while working numerous toiling nights to keep the magazine publishing company afloat. The magazine sent ripples in the software world where it was recognized as an essential service for buyers and sellers of hardware and software. Numerous software vendors sought the magazine to promote their products and services which resulted Leonsis selling advertising to them based on a Yellow Pages business model. The first issue of the magazine was a success and sold $50,000 worth of copies when the magazine first got published in the fall of 1982 and was sold near cash registers, bookstores, and newsstands.[20] Just two years later, he sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million netting Leonsis $20 million making him a multimillionaire in the process.[20][22]
AOL[edit]
In 1987, Leonsis established the marketing communications company, Redgate Communications Corporation.[23] When the organization was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1994, Leonsis began working with AOL as a senior executive, remaining with the company for 13 years.[24] Under his leadership, AOL increased its membership from under 800,000 members to over 8 million, while their annual revenue increased from $100 million to $1.5 billion.[25] He held numerous positions at AOL during his years there, completing his tenure and retiring in 2006 as the audience group's president and vice-chairman.[26] As of 2014[update], he serves as vice chairman emeritus of AOL.[citation needed]
Monumental Sports & Entertainment[edit]
Leonsis is the founder, majority owner, chairman and CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the NHL's Washington Capitals, NBA's Washington Wizards, WNBA's Washington Mystics, and the AFL's Washington Valor & Baltimore Brigade. Monumental Sports additionally owns the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.[27] and manages the Kettler Capitals Iceplex and George Mason University's EagleBank Arena.[28] Formed in 2010 by a merger between Leonsis' Lincoln Holdings with Washington Sports & Entertainment, Monumental Sports & Entertainment is the only privately held company in a top-10 market to own and operate three professional sports teams and its arena.[29][30][31] In January 2013 Monumental Sports & Entertainment launched Monumental Network, a digital platform that serves as a hub for Washington's sports and entertainment news.[32] In 2016 a rebranded Monumental Sports Network was launched for digital, mobile and over-the-top platforms.[33] The new Monumental Sports Network offers an OTT service that provides live streaming of Mystics, Valor and AFL Baltimore games as well as additional live events and games. Monumental and CSN Mid-Atlantic formed an advanced media partnership that not only extended CSN’s exclusive media rights to the Capitals and Wizards but also saw Monumental become an equity partner in CSN. Additionally, NBC Sports Group invested in Monumental Sports Network, becoming an equity partner.[34]

Management

Leonsis has a "hands on" approach to management of his sports teams.[35] After purchasing the Wizards, Leonsis criticized the NBA's salary cap at a luncheon with business leaders. He was fined $100,000 by the league, for "unauthorized public comments regarding the league's collective bargaining negotiations."[36] Leonsis has sought to roll-back changes to the Wizards and Capitals franchises that coincided with the opening of the Verizon Center in 1997. In 2007, he changed the Capitals team logo and its colors back to their original red, white, and blue, and in May 2011, received positive responses from media, fans, players and alumni when the Wizards unveiled a similar red, white and blue color scheme, along with uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the team under their former name, the Bullets, when they won the NBA Championship in 1978.[37] Additionally, he had taken under consideration restoring the Bullets name to the franchise,[38] though critics said that this would "send the wrong message" about gun violence in Washington.[39]

Washington Capitals

Leonsis has owned the Washington Capitals since the spring of 1999, and in that timeframe the team has won seven Southeast Division titles, two Presidents’ Trophy and has recorded more than 200 consecutive sellouts at Verizon Center.[31]
In the early years of his ownership, the Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In summer 2001, the Capitals traded for Jaromír Jágr and signed him to what was at the time, the largest contract in NHL history. The trade was enthusiastically well received by fans and over 300 people showed up at Dulles International Airport to greet Jágr when he arrived.[40] After Jágr was traded in 2004, Leonsis was criticized by fans.[41] He was involved in a physical altercation with a fan, who led a mocking chant of Leonsis during the game and hoisted a sign chiding him. In the altercation, Leonsis grabbed and threw the fan to the ground, which also caused a young child to fall to the ground. For his involvement in the scuffle, Leonsis was fined $100,000. He also received a suspension of one week, during which he was prohibited from having any contact with the team.[42] After the incident, Leonsis personally called the fan to apologize for his actions and invited him and his family to watch a game in the owner's box.[43]




Leonsis watches Wizards player John Wall in 2010


In 2009, a season ticket holder informed Leonsis of a homeless man, Scott Lovell, who spent his nights sleeping outside Verizon Center. Leonsis found Lovell a part-time job as a restaurant kitchen worker and provided him with a paid and furnished apartment, a prosthetic leg and Capitals season tickets for life. In return, Lovell vowed to remain clean and sober.[44]
In 2010, journalist Damien Cox, author of the Ovechkin Project, a biography of Alexander Ovechkin, wrote that Leonsis was trying to circumvent the NHL's salary cap when signing Ovechkin's contract.[45] He also alleged that Leonsis was bribing bloggers for positive coverage of the Capitals.[46] Leonsis said that Cox was angry that he did not receive the access to Ovechkin that he wanted and defended his support for the league.[47]
During the 2009–2010 season, the Capitals earned the NHL's President's Trophy as the team that finished with the most points in the league during the regular season.[48]
The 2010–2011 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history, drawing 754,309 fans.[49] The Capitals, like other teams, have raised ticket prices in recent years.[50][51] In 2011, after raising ticket prices for the fourth consecutive year while shrinking the size of beers sold at the Verizon Center, he earned the nickname "Leon$i$".[52] In 2001, Leonsis claimed to have written a computer program that prevented Pittsburgh Penguins fans (the Capitals first-round opponent) from purchasing tickets online. When asked if the actions were unfair, Leonsis stated, "I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it."[53] Again in 2009, he received criticism for preventing visiting team fans from purchasing Capitals playoff tickets.[54]
In the face of community opposition, Leonsis has persisted with a plan to expand the billboards around the Verizon Center.[55] Critics said the signage would make the arena more garish and cheapen DC's Chinatown, Leonsis said it was necessary to raise an additional $20 to 30 million in annual revenue, and a sports expert explained that "an owner saddled with underperforming teams is under greater pressure to find income sources."[56][57][58] Leonsis persevered and in March 2013 construction of the new signs were announced.[57]
In 2013, Leonsis received a letter about Jack Dibler, a lifelong Capitals fan who had recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In response, Leonsis sent Dibler a package that included a signed Alexander Ovechkin jersey and a letter inviting Dibler and his family to a game.[59]

Washington Wizards

Leonsis became the majority owner of the Washington Wizards in June 2010, inheriting a team that had 26 wins and 56 losses during the previous season.[60] Leonsis has taken a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website.[61] On May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms and logo. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years.[62] During Leonsis’ tenure as owner, the Wizards have compiled a promising young nucleus of players, including John Wall (No. 1 pick in the 2010 NBA Draft), Bradley Beal (No. 3 pick in the 2012 NBA Draft) and Otto Porter Jr. (No. 3 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft). They have also acquired veterans like Nenê and Marcin Gortat via trade.[63][64] Leonsis was chairman of the NBA's 2014 media committee that negotiated a nine-year expanded partnership with Turner Broadcasting and The Walt Disney Company.[65]
In February 2016, construction started on a new practice facility for the Wizards.[66] The development was paid for by DC taxpayers and District-funded Events DC while Leonsis' contribution to the $55 million cost was considered ceremonial.[66] The Wizards also announced that they would raise ticket prices for a third consecutive year.[66]

Washington Mystics

Leonsis purchased the rights to the Mystics around the same time he took over the Wizards.

Washington Valor and Baltimore Brigade

On March 10, 2016, Leonsis announced that he was purchasing an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League (AFL) to play at the Verizon Center beginning in 2017. On March 16, 2016, the announcement was made official by AFL commissioner Scott Butera.[67] On July 14, 2016, the team name was revealed as the Washington Valor.[68] On November 14, 2016, Monumental announced that it had acquired an AFL team that would begin play in 2017 in Baltimore.[69] The team name was later revealed as the Baltimore Brigade.
SnagFilms[edit]
Leonsis is the founder, chairman and largest shareholder of SnagFilms, a content and technology company with a full-service video streaming platform, professional video and journalism content assets and established relationships with the creative community. SnagFilms has more than 5,000 films in its digital library and is available online and on its proprietary applications on every mobile and connected device.

Personal background[edit]
Theodore John Leonsis was born on January 8, 1957 in Brooklyn, New York. Born to a family of working class Greek immigrant parents and grandparents who were mill workers,[8][9] who worked as a waiter and a secretary.[10] Citing his humble beginnings and working-class background, Leonsis states the highest income they ever earned was $31,000 combined as his dad worked for tips – often received in change – as he worked a counter for breakfast and lunch at a diner and recalling his fathers agony when he lost his job. When his high school guidance counselor evaluated his skillsets, the counselor concluded that young Ted was destined to work in a grocery store.[11] Leonsis also reflects on his working-class roots that being a grocery store manager was all his dad aspired him to be. During his youth, Leonsis mowed lawns for extra money.[12] One day when mowing, he stumbled upon mowing the lawn owned by a wealthy stockbroker and Georgetown alumus named Jim Shannon. Impressed by Leonsis's strong work ethic and cutting the grass with extra care to impress the older gentlemen, he helped Leonsis gain admission into Georgetown University.[11][12]
He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, before moving to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Lowell High School in 1973.[13] In 2005, he was honored as one of Lowell High School's Distinguished Alumni for reaching the highest level of accomplishment and possessing the highest standards of integrity and character. He was first in his family to go to university where he attended Georgetown University to pursue his undergraduate studies majoring in American studies graduating in 1977 at the top of his class.[8][14][15] One of his most memorable college experiences was when he threw himself into a college English project to prove that Ernest Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the Sea" years before the book was published.[11][16] Also during college, Leonsis, with encouragement from a mentor, Reverend Joseph Durkin, used computers and primitive punch cards to his thesis where it introduced him to the potential fortunes that were to be made in the emerging software and personal computer industries of the early 1980s.[16] After graduating from college, he then moved back to his parents' home in Lowell and began working for Wang Laboratories as a corporate communications manager and Harris Corp. as a marketing executive.[13][17][18][19]
Business career[edit]




Leonsis speaking to the Tech Council of Maryland


LIST Magazine[edit]
Leonsis left Harris Corporation in March 1981 when, at the age 25, he moved to Florida and began his first business venture. His first venture was publishing LIST, a technology magazine that focused on the then personal computing industry.[20] He raised $1 million in seed capital with his partner Vincent Pica,[21] while working numerous toiling nights to keep the magazine publishing company afloat. The magazine sent ripples in the software world where it was recognized as an essential service for buyers and sellers of hardware and software. Numerous software vendors sought the magazine to promote their products and services which resulted Leonsis selling advertising to them based on a Yellow Pages business model. The first issue of the magazine was a success and sold $50,000 worth of copies when the magazine first got published in the fall of 1982 and was sold near cash registers, bookstores, and newsstands.[20] Just two years later, he sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million netting Leonsis $20 million making him a multimillionaire in the process.[20][22]
AOL[edit]
In 1987, Leonsis established the marketing communications company, Redgate Communications Corporation.[23] When the organization was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1994, Leonsis began working with AOL as a senior executive, remaining with the company for 13 years.[24] Under his leadership, AOL increased its membership from under 800,000 members to over 8 million, while their annual revenue increased from $100 million to $1.5 billion.[25] He held numerous positions at AOL during his years there, completing his tenure and retiring in 2006 as the audience group's president and vice-chairman.[26] As of 2014[update], he serves as vice chairman emeritus of AOL.[citation needed]
Monumental Sports & Entertainment[edit]
Leonsis is the founder, majority owner, chairman and CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the NHL's Washington Capitals, NBA's Washington Wizards, WNBA's Washington Mystics, and the AFL's Washington Valor & Baltimore Brigade. Monumental Sports additionally owns the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.[27] and manages the Kettler Capitals Iceplex and George Mason University's EagleBank Arena.[28] Formed in 2010 by a merger between Leonsis' Lincoln Holdings with Washington Sports & Entertainment, Monumental Sports & Entertainment is the only privately held company in a top-10 market to own and operate three professional sports teams and its arena.[29][30][31] In January 2013 Monumental Sports & Entertainment launched Monumental Network, a digital platform that serves as a hub for Washington's sports and entertainment news.[32] In 2016 a rebranded Monumental Sports Network was launched for digital, mobile and over-the-top platforms.[33] The new Monumental Sports Network offers an OTT service that provides live streaming of Mystics, Valor and AFL Baltimore games as well as additional live events and games. Monumental and CSN Mid-Atlantic formed an advanced media partnership that not only extended CSN’s exclusive media rights to the Capitals and Wizards but also saw Monumental become an equity partner in CSN. Additionally, NBC Sports Group invested in Monumental Sports Network, becoming an equity partner.[34]

Management

Leonsis has a "hands on" approach to management of his sports teams.[35] After purchasing the Wizards, Leonsis criticized the NBA's salary cap at a luncheon with business leaders. He was fined $100,000 by the league, for "unauthorized public comments regarding the league's collective bargaining negotiations."[36] Leonsis has sought to roll-back changes to the Wizards and Capitals franchises that coincided with the opening of the Verizon Center in 1997. In 2007, he changed the Capitals team logo and its colors back to their original red, white, and blue, and in May 2011, received positive responses from media, fans, players and alumni when the Wizards unveiled a similar red, white and blue color scheme, along with uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the team under their former name, the Bullets, when they won the NBA Championship in 1978.[37] Additionally, he had taken under consideration restoring the Bullets name to the franchise,[38] though critics said that this would "send the wrong message" about gun violence in Washington.[39]

Washington Capitals

Leonsis has owned the Washington Capitals since the spring of 1999, and in that timeframe the team has won seven Southeast Division titles, two Presidents’ Trophy and has recorded more than 200 consecutive sellouts at Verizon Center.[31]
In the early years of his ownership, the Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In summer 2001, the Capitals traded for Jaromír Jágr and signed him to what was at the time, the largest contract in NHL history. The trade was enthusiastically well received by fans and over 300 people showed up at Dulles International Airport to greet Jágr when he arrived.[40] After Jágr was traded in 2004, Leonsis was criticized by fans.[41] He was involved in a physical altercation with a fan, who led a mocking chant of Leonsis during the game and hoisted a sign chiding him. In the altercation, Leonsis grabbed and threw the fan to the ground, which also caused a young child to fall to the ground. For his involvement in the scuffle, Leonsis was fined $100,000. He also received a suspension of one week, during which he was prohibited from having any contact with the team.[42] After the incident, Leonsis personally called the fan to apologize for his actions and invited him and his family to watch a game in the owner's box.[43]




Leonsis watches Wizards player John Wall in 2010


In 2009, a season ticket holder informed Leonsis of a homeless man, Scott Lovell, who spent his nights sleeping outside Verizon Center. Leonsis found Lovell a part-time job as a restaurant kitchen worker and provided him with a paid and furnished apartment, a prosthetic leg and Capitals season tickets for life. In return, Lovell vowed to remain clean and sober.[44]
In 2010, journalist Damien Cox, author of the Ovechkin Project, a biography of Alexander Ovechkin, wrote that Leonsis was trying to circumvent the NHL's salary cap when signing Ovechkin's contract.[45] He also alleged that Leonsis was bribing bloggers for positive coverage of the Capitals.[46] Leonsis said that Cox was angry that he did not receive the access to Ovechkin that he wanted and defended his support for the league.[47]
During the 2009–2010 season, the Capitals earned the NHL's President's Trophy as the team that finished with the most points in the league during the regular season.[48]
The 2010–2011 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history, drawing 754,309 fans.[49] The Capitals, like other teams, have raised ticket prices in recent years.[50][51] In 2011, after raising ticket prices for the fourth consecutive year while shrinking the size of beers sold at the Verizon Center, he earned the nickname "Leon$i$".[52] In 2001, Leonsis claimed to have written a computer program that prevented Pittsburgh Penguins fans (the Capitals first-round opponent) from purchasing tickets online. When asked if the actions were unfair, Leonsis stated, "I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it."[53] Again in 2009, he received criticism for preventing visiting team fans from purchasing Capitals playoff tickets.[54]
In the face of community opposition, Leonsis has persisted with a plan to expand the billboards around the Verizon Center.[55] Critics said the signage would make the arena more garish and cheapen DC's Chinatown, Leonsis said it was necessary to raise an additional $20 to 30 million in annual revenue, and a sports expert explained that "an owner saddled with underperforming teams is under greater pressure to find income sources."[56][57][58] Leonsis persevered and in March 2013 construction of the new signs were announced.[57]
In 2013, Leonsis received a letter about Jack Dibler, a lifelong Capitals fan who had recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In response, Leonsis sent Dibler a package that included a signed Alexander Ovechkin jersey and a letter inviting Dibler and his family to a game.[59]

Washington Wizards

Leonsis became the majority owner of the Washington Wizards in June 2010, inheriting a team that had 26 wins and 56 losses during the previous season.[60] Leonsis has taken a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website.[61] On May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms and logo. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years.[62] During Leonsis’ tenure as owner, the Wizards have compiled a promising young nucleus of players, including John Wall (No. 1 pick in the 2010 NBA Draft), Bradley Beal (No. 3 pick in the 2012 NBA Draft) and Otto Porter Jr. (No. 3 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft). They have also acquired veterans like Nenê and Marcin Gortat via trade.[63][64] Leonsis was chairman of the NBA's 2014 media committee that negotiated a nine-year expanded partnership with Turner Broadcasting and The Walt Disney Company.[65]
In February 2016, construction started on a new practice facility for the Wizards.[66] The development was paid for by DC taxpayers and District-funded Events DC while Leonsis' contribution to the $55 million cost was considered ceremonial.[66] The Wizards also announced that they would raise ticket prices for a third consecutive year.[66]

Washington Mystics

Leonsis purchased the rights to the Mystics around the same time he took over the Wizards.

Washington Valor and Baltimore Brigade

On March 10, 2016, Leonsis announced that he was purchasing an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League (AFL) to play at the Verizon Center beginning in 2017. On March 16, 2016, the announcement was made official by AFL commissioner Scott Butera.[67] On July 14, 2016, the team name was revealed as the Washington Valor.[68] On November 14, 2016, Monumental announced that it had acquired an AFL team that would begin play in 2017 in Baltimore.[69] The team name was later revealed as the Baltimore Brigade.

The film was narrated by actor Colin Farrell and featured residents of Afghanistan; Kenya; Dublin, Ireland; Charlotte, North Carolina; Madrid; and Saint Petersburg.

He acquired the property for $20 million after selling homes in McLean, Virginia and Vero Beach, Florida.[1] The 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) estate was once the home of Joseph P.

Personal background[edit]
Theodore John Leonsis was born on January 8, 1957 in Brooklyn, New York. Born to a family of working class Greek immigrant parents and grandparents who were mill workers,[8][9] who worked as a waiter and a secretary.[10] Citing his humble beginnings and working-class background, Leonsis states the highest income they ever earned was $31,000 combined as his dad worked for tips – often received in change – as he worked a counter for breakfast and lunch at a diner and recalling his fathers agony when he lost his job. When his high school guidance counselor evaluated his skillsets, the counselor concluded that young Ted was destined to work in a grocery store.[11] Leonsis also reflects on his working-class roots that being a grocery store manager was all his dad aspired him to be. During his youth, Leonsis mowed lawns for extra money.[12] One day when mowing, he stumbled upon mowing the lawn owned by a wealthy stockbroker and Georgetown alumus named Jim Shannon. Impressed by Leonsis's strong work ethic and cutting the grass with extra care to impress the older gentlemen, he helped Leonsis gain admission into Georgetown University.[11][12]
He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, before moving to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Lowell High School in 1973.[13] In 2005, he was honored as one of Lowell High School's Distinguished Alumni for reaching the highest level of accomplishment and possessing the highest standards of integrity and character. He was first in his family to go to university where he attended Georgetown University to pursue his undergraduate studies majoring in American studies graduating in 1977 at the top of his class.[8][14][15] One of his most memorable college experiences was when he threw himself into a college English project to prove that Ernest Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the Sea" years before the book was published.[11][16] Also during college, Leonsis, with encouragement from a mentor, Reverend Joseph Durkin, used computers and primitive punch cards to his thesis where it introduced him to the potential fortunes that were to be made in the emerging software and personal computer industries of the early 1980s.[16] After graduating from college, he then moved back to his parents' home in Lowell and began working for Wang Laboratories as a corporate communications manager and Harris Corp. as a marketing executive.[13][17][18][19]
Business career[edit]




Leonsis speaking to the Tech Council of Maryland


LIST Magazine[edit]
Leonsis left Harris Corporation in March 1981 when, at the age 25, he moved to Florida and began his first business venture. His first venture was publishing LIST, a technology magazine that focused on the then personal computing industry.[20] He raised $1 million in seed capital with his partner Vincent Pica,[21] while working numerous toiling nights to keep the magazine publishing company afloat. The magazine sent ripples in the software world where it was recognized as an essential service for buyers and sellers of hardware and software. Numerous software vendors sought the magazine to promote their products and services which resulted Leonsis selling advertising to them based on a Yellow Pages business model. The first issue of the magazine was a success and sold $50,000 worth of copies when the magazine first got published in the fall of 1982 and was sold near cash registers, bookstores, and newsstands.[20] Just two years later, he sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million netting Leonsis $20 million making him a multimillionaire in the process.[20][22]
AOL[edit]
In 1987, Leonsis established the marketing communications company, Redgate Communications Corporation.[23] When the organization was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1994, Leonsis began working with AOL as a senior executive, remaining with the company for 13 years.[24] Under his leadership, AOL increased its membership from under 800,000 members to over 8 million, while their annual revenue increased from $100 million to $1.5 billion.[25] He held numerous positions at AOL during his years there, completing his tenure and retiring in 2006 as the audience group's president and vice-chairman.[26] As of 2014[update], he serves as vice chairman emeritus of AOL.[citation needed]
Monumental Sports & Entertainment[edit]
Leonsis is the founder, majority owner, chairman and CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the NHL's Washington Capitals, NBA's Washington Wizards, WNBA's Washington Mystics, and the AFL's Washington Valor & Baltimore Brigade. Monumental Sports additionally owns the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.[27] and manages the Kettler Capitals Iceplex and George Mason University's EagleBank Arena.[28] Formed in 2010 by a merger between Leonsis' Lincoln Holdings with Washington Sports & Entertainment, Monumental Sports & Entertainment is the only privately held company in a top-10 market to own and operate three professional sports teams and its arena.[29][30][31] In January 2013 Monumental Sports & Entertainment launched Monumental Network, a digital platform that serves as a hub for Washington's sports and entertainment news.[32] In 2016 a rebranded Monumental Sports Network was launched for digital, mobile and over-the-top platforms.[33] The new Monumental Sports Network offers an OTT service that provides live streaming of Mystics, Valor and AFL Baltimore games as well as additional live events and games. Monumental and CSN Mid-Atlantic formed an advanced media partnership that not only extended CSN’s exclusive media rights to the Capitals and Wizards but also saw Monumental become an equity partner in CSN. Additionally, NBC Sports Group invested in Monumental Sports Network, becoming an equity partner.[34]

Management

Leonsis has a "hands on" approach to management of his sports teams.[35] After purchasing the Wizards, Leonsis criticized the NBA's salary cap at a luncheon with business leaders. He was fined $100,000 by the league, for "unauthorized public comments regarding the league's collective bargaining negotiations."[36] Leonsis has sought to roll-back changes to the Wizards and Capitals franchises that coincided with the opening of the Verizon Center in 1997. In 2007, he changed the Capitals team logo and its colors back to their original red, white, and blue, and in May 2011, received positive responses from media, fans, players and alumni when the Wizards unveiled a similar red, white and blue color scheme, along with uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the team under their former name, the Bullets, when they won the NBA Championship in 1978.[37] Additionally, he had taken under consideration restoring the Bullets name to the franchise,[38] though critics said that this would "send the wrong message" about gun violence in Washington.[39]

Washington Capitals

Leonsis has owned the Washington Capitals since the spring of 1999, and in that timeframe the team has won seven Southeast Division titles, two Presidents’ Trophy and has recorded more than 200 consecutive sellouts at Verizon Center.[31]
In the early years of his ownership, the Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In summer 2001, the Capitals traded for Jaromír Jágr and signed him to what was at the time, the largest contract in NHL history. The trade was enthusiastically well received by fans and over 300 people showed up at Dulles International Airport to greet Jágr when he arrived.[40] After Jágr was traded in 2004, Leonsis was criticized by fans.[41] He was involved in a physical altercation with a fan, who led a mocking chant of Leonsis during the game and hoisted a sign chiding him. In the altercation, Leonsis grabbed and threw the fan to the ground, which also caused a young child to fall to the ground. For his involvement in the scuffle, Leonsis was fined $100,000. He also received a suspension of one week, during which he was prohibited from having any contact with the team.[42] After the incident, Leonsis personally called the fan to apologize for his actions and invited him and his family to watch a game in the owner's box.[43]




Leonsis watches Wizards player John Wall in 2010


In 2009, a season ticket holder informed Leonsis of a homeless man, Scott Lovell, who spent his nights sleeping outside Verizon Center. Leonsis found Lovell a part-time job as a restaurant kitchen worker and provided him with a paid and furnished apartment, a prosthetic leg and Capitals season tickets for life. In return, Lovell vowed to remain clean and sober.[44]
In 2010, journalist Damien Cox, author of the Ovechkin Project, a biography of Alexander Ovechkin, wrote that Leonsis was trying to circumvent the NHL's salary cap when signing Ovechkin's contract.[45] He also alleged that Leonsis was bribing bloggers for positive coverage of the Capitals.[46] Leonsis said that Cox was angry that he did not receive the access to Ovechkin that he wanted and defended his support for the league.[47]
During the 2009–2010 season, the Capitals earned the NHL's President's Trophy as the team that finished with the most points in the league during the regular season.[48]
The 2010–2011 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history, drawing 754,309 fans.[49] The Capitals, like other teams, have raised ticket prices in recent years.[50][51] In 2011, after raising ticket prices for the fourth consecutive year while shrinking the size of beers sold at the Verizon Center, he earned the nickname "Leon$i$".[52] In 2001, Leonsis claimed to have written a computer program that prevented Pittsburgh Penguins fans (the Capitals first-round opponent) from purchasing tickets online. When asked if the actions were unfair, Leonsis stated, "I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it."[53] Again in 2009, he received criticism for preventing visiting team fans from purchasing Capitals playoff tickets.[54]
In the face of community opposition, Leonsis has persisted with a plan to expand the billboards around the Verizon Center.[55] Critics said the signage would make the arena more garish and cheapen DC's Chinatown, Leonsis said it was necessary to raise an additional $20 to 30 million in annual revenue, and a sports expert explained that "an owner saddled with underperforming teams is under greater pressure to find income sources."[56][57][58] Leonsis persevered and in March 2013 construction of the new signs were announced.[57]
In 2013, Leonsis received a letter about Jack Dibler, a lifelong Capitals fan who had recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In response, Leonsis sent Dibler a package that included a signed Alexander Ovechkin jersey and a letter inviting Dibler and his family to a game.[59]

Washington Wizards

Leonsis became the majority owner of the Washington Wizards in June 2010, inheriting a team that had 26 wins and 56 losses during the previous season.[60] Leonsis has taken a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website.[61] On May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms and logo.

Personal background[edit]
Theodore John Leonsis was born on January 8, 1957 in Brooklyn, New York. Born to a family of working class Greek immigrant parents and grandparents who were mill workers,[8][9] who worked as a waiter and a secretary.[10] Citing his humble beginnings and working-class background, Leonsis states the highest income they ever earned was $31,000 combined as his dad worked for tips – often received in change – as he worked a counter for breakfast and lunch at a diner and recalling his fathers agony when he lost his job. When his high school guidance counselor evaluated his skillsets, the counselor concluded that young Ted was destined to work in a grocery store.[11] Leonsis also reflects on his working-class roots that being a grocery store manager was all his dad aspired him to be. During his youth, Leonsis mowed lawns for extra money.[12] One day when mowing, he stumbled upon mowing the lawn owned by a wealthy stockbroker and Georgetown alumus named Jim Shannon. Impressed by Leonsis's strong work ethic and cutting the grass with extra care to impress the older gentlemen, he helped Leonsis gain admission into Georgetown University.[11][12]
He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, before moving to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Lowell High School in 1973.[13] In 2005, he was honored as one of Lowell High School's Distinguished Alumni for reaching the highest level of accomplishment and possessing the highest standards of integrity and character. He was first in his family to go to university where he attended Georgetown University to pursue his undergraduate studies majoring in American studies graduating in 1977 at the top of his class.[8][14][15] One of his most memorable college experiences was when he threw himself into a college English project to prove that Ernest Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the Sea" years before the book was published.[11][16] Also during college, Leonsis, with encouragement from a mentor, Reverend Joseph Durkin, used computers and primitive punch cards to his thesis where it introduced him to the potential fortunes that were to be made in the emerging software and personal computer industries of the early 1980s.[16] After graduating from college, he then moved back to his parents' home in Lowell and began working for Wang Laboratories as a corporate communications manager and Harris Corp. as a marketing executive.[13][17][18][19]
Business career[edit]




Leonsis speaking to the Tech Council of Maryland


LIST Magazine[edit]
Leonsis left Harris Corporation in March 1981 when, at the age 25, he moved to Florida and began his first business venture. His first venture was publishing LIST, a technology magazine that focused on the then personal computing industry.[20] He raised $1 million in seed capital with his partner Vincent Pica,[21] while working numerous toiling nights to keep the magazine publishing company afloat. The magazine sent ripples in the software world where it was recognized as an essential service for buyers and sellers of hardware and software. Numerous software vendors sought the magazine to promote their products and services which resulted Leonsis selling advertising to them based on a Yellow Pages business model. The first issue of the magazine was a success and sold $50,000 worth of copies when the magazine first got published in the fall of 1982 and was sold near cash registers, bookstores, and newsstands.[20] Just two years later, he sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million netting Leonsis $20 million making him a multimillionaire in the process.[20][22]
AOL[edit]
In 1987, Leonsis established the marketing communications company, Redgate Communications Corporation.[23] When the organization was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1994, Leonsis began working with AOL as a senior executive, remaining with the company for 13 years.[24] Under his leadership, AOL increased its membership from under 800,000 members to over 8 million, while their annual revenue increased from $100 million to $1.5 billion.[25] He held numerous positions at AOL during his years there, completing his tenure and retiring in 2006 as the audience group's president and vice-chairman.[26] As of 2014[update], he serves as vice chairman emeritus of AOL.[citation needed]
Monumental Sports & Entertainment[edit]
Leonsis is the founder, majority owner, chairman and CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the NHL's Washington Capitals, NBA's Washington Wizards, WNBA's Washington Mystics, and the AFL's Washington Valor & Baltimore Brigade. Monumental Sports additionally owns the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.[27] and manages the Kettler Capitals Iceplex and George Mason University's EagleBank Arena.[28] Formed in 2010 by a merger between Leonsis' Lincoln Holdings with Washington Sports & Entertainment, Monumental Sports & Entertainment is the only privately held company in a top-10 market to own and operate three professional sports teams and its arena.[29][30][31] In January 2013 Monumental Sports & Entertainment launched Monumental Network, a digital platform that serves as a hub for Washington's sports and entertainment news.[32] In 2016 a rebranded Monumental Sports Network was launched for digital, mobile and over-the-top platforms.[33] The new Monumental Sports Network offers an OTT service that provides live streaming of Mystics, Valor and AFL Baltimore games as well as additional live events and games. Monumental and CSN Mid-Atlantic formed an advanced media partnership that not only extended CSN’s exclusive media rights to the Capitals and Wizards but also saw Monumental become an equity partner in CSN. Additionally, NBC Sports Group invested in Monumental Sports Network, becoming an equity partner.[34]

Management

Leonsis has a "hands on" approach to management of his sports teams.[35] After purchasing the Wizards, Leonsis criticized the NBA's salary cap at a luncheon with business leaders. He was fined $100,000 by the league, for "unauthorized public comments regarding the league's collective bargaining negotiations."[36] Leonsis has sought to roll-back changes to the Wizards and Capitals franchises that coincided with the opening of the Verizon Center in 1997. In 2007, he changed the Capitals team logo and its colors back to their original red, white, and blue, and in May 2011, received positive responses from media, fans, players and alumni when the Wizards unveiled a similar red, white and blue color scheme, along with uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the team under their former name, the Bullets, when they won the NBA Championship in 1978.[37] Additionally, he had taken under consideration restoring the Bullets name to the franchise,[38] though critics said that this would "send the wrong message" about gun violence in Washington.[39]

Washington Capitals

Leonsis has owned the Washington Capitals since the spring of 1999, and in that timeframe the team has won seven Southeast Division titles, two Presidents’ Trophy and has recorded more than 200 consecutive sellouts at Verizon Center.[31]
In the early years of his ownership, the Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In summer 2001, the Capitals traded for Jaromír Jágr and signed him to what was at the time, the largest contract in NHL history. The trade was enthusiastically well received by fans and over 300 people showed up at Dulles International Airport to greet Jágr when he arrived.[40] After Jágr was traded in 2004, Leonsis was criticized by fans.[41] He was involved in a physical altercation with a fan, who led a mocking chant of Leonsis during the game and hoisted a sign chiding him. In the altercation, Leonsis grabbed and threw the fan to the ground, which also caused a young child to fall to the ground. For his involvement in the scuffle, Leonsis was fined $100,000. He also received a suspension of one week, during which he was prohibited from having any contact with the team.[42] After the incident, Leonsis personally called the fan to apologize for his actions and invited him and his family to watch a game in the owner's box.[43]




Leonsis watches Wizards player John Wall in 2010


In 2009, a season ticket holder informed Leonsis of a homeless man, Scott Lovell, who spent his nights sleeping outside Verizon Center. Leonsis found Lovell a part-time job as a restaurant kitchen worker and provided him with a paid and furnished apartment, a prosthetic leg and Capitals season tickets for life. In return, Lovell vowed to remain clean and sober.[44]
In 2010, journalist Damien Cox, author of the Ovechkin Project, a biography of Alexander Ovechkin, wrote that Leonsis was trying to circumvent the NHL's salary cap when signing Ovechkin's contract.[45] He also alleged that Leonsis was bribing bloggers for positive coverage of the Capitals.[46] Leonsis said that Cox was angry that he did not receive the access to Ovechkin that he wanted and defended his support for the league.[47]
During the 2009–2010 season, the Capitals earned the NHL's President's Trophy as the team that finished with the most points in the league during the regular season.[48]
The 2010–2011 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history, drawing 754,309 fans.[49] The Capitals, like other teams, have raised ticket prices in recent years.[50][51] In 2011, after raising ticket prices for the fourth consecutive year while shrinking the size of beers sold at the Verizon Center, he earned the nickname "Leon$i$".[52] In 2001, Leonsis claimed to have written a computer program that prevented Pittsburgh Penguins fans (the Capitals first-round opponent) from purchasing tickets online. When asked if the actions were unfair, Leonsis stated, "I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it."[53] Again in 2009, he received criticism for preventing visiting team fans from purchasing Capitals playoff tickets.[54]
In the face of community opposition, Leonsis has persisted with a plan to expand the billboards around the Verizon Center.[55] Critics said the signage would make the arena more garish and cheapen DC's Chinatown, Leonsis said it was necessary to raise an additional $20 to 30 million in annual revenue, and a sports expert explained that "an owner saddled with underperforming teams is under greater pressure to find income sources."[56][57][58] Leonsis persevered and in March 2013 construction of the new signs were announced.[57]
In 2013, Leonsis received a letter about Jack Dibler, a lifelong Capitals fan who had recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In response, Leonsis sent Dibler a package that included a signed Alexander Ovechkin jersey and a letter inviting Dibler and his family to a game.[59]

Washington Wizards

Leonsis became the majority owner of the Washington Wizards in June 2010, inheriting a team that had 26 wins and 56 losses during the previous season.[60] Leonsis has taken a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website.[61] On May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms and logo. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years.[62] During Leonsis’ tenure as owner, the Wizards have compiled a promising young nucleus of players, including John Wall (No. 1 pick in the 2010 NBA Draft), Bradley Beal (No. 3 pick in the 2012 NBA Draft) and Otto Porter Jr. (No. 3 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft). They have also acquired veterans like Nenê and Marcin Gortat via trade.[63][64] Leonsis was chairman of the NBA's 2014 media committee that negotiated a nine-year expanded partnership with Turner Broadcasting and The Walt Disney Company.[65]
In February 2016, construction started on a new practice facility for the Wizards.[66] The development was paid for by DC taxpayers and District-funded Events DC while Leonsis' contribution to the $55 million cost was considered ceremonial.[66] The Wizards also announced that they would raise ticket prices for a third consecutive year.[66]

Washington Mystics

Leonsis purchased the rights to the Mystics around the same time he took over the Wizards.

Washington Valor and Baltimore Brigade

On March 10, 2016, Leonsis announced that he was purchasing an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League (AFL) to play at the Verizon Center beginning in 2017. On March 16, 2016, the announcement was made official by AFL commissioner Scott Butera.[67] On July 14, 2016, the team name was revealed as the Washington Valor.[68] On November 14, 2016, Monumental announced that it had acquired an AFL team that would begin play in 2017 in Baltimore.[69] The team name was later revealed as the Baltimore Brigade.

It was honored with the 2008 Peabody Award[72] and the 2009 News & Documentary Emmy Award for Best Historical Programming (Long Form).[73]
In 2008, Leonsis produced Kicking It, which is a documentary by Susan Koch about the 2006 Homeless World Cup. The film was narrated by actor Colin Farrell and featured residents of Afghanistan; Kenya; Dublin, Ireland; Charlotte, North Carolina; Madrid; and Saint Petersburg. The film premiered in January 2008 at the Sundance Film Festival.[citation needed]
A third documentary, A Fighting Chance, tells the story of Kyle Maynard, who became a nationally ranked wrestler, motivational speaker, and bestselling author, despite being born without arms or legs.[74]

In early 2011, Leonsis purchased a 13-acre estate in Potomac, Maryland. He acquired the property for $20 million after selling homes in McLean, Virginia and Vero Beach, Florida.[1] The 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) estate was once the home of Joseph P.

Personal background[edit]
Theodore John Leonsis was born on January 8, 1957 in Brooklyn, New York. Born to a family of working class Greek immigrant parents and grandparents who were mill workers,[8][9] who worked as a waiter and a secretary.[10] Citing his humble beginnings and working-class background, Leonsis states the highest income they ever earned was $31,000 combined as his dad worked for tips – often received in change – as he worked a counter for breakfast and lunch at a diner and recalling his fathers agony when he lost his job. When his high school guidance counselor evaluated his skillsets, the counselor concluded that young Ted was destined to work in a grocery store.[11] Leonsis also reflects on his working-class roots that being a grocery store manager was all his dad aspired him to be. During his youth, Leonsis mowed lawns for extra money.[12] One day when mowing, he stumbled upon mowing the lawn owned by a wealthy stockbroker and Georgetown alumus named Jim Shannon. Impressed by Leonsis's strong work ethic and cutting the grass with extra care to impress the older gentlemen, he helped Leonsis gain admission into Georgetown University.[11][12]
He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, before moving to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Lowell High School in 1973.[13] In 2005, he was honored as one of Lowell High School's Distinguished Alumni for reaching the highest level of accomplishment and possessing the highest standards of integrity and character. He was first in his family to go to university where he attended Georgetown University to pursue his undergraduate studies majoring in American studies graduating in 1977 at the top of his class.[8][14][15] One of his most memorable college experiences was when he threw himself into a college English project to prove that Ernest Hemingway wrote "The Old Man and the Sea" years before the book was published.[11][16] Also during college, Leonsis, with encouragement from a mentor, Reverend Joseph Durkin, used computers and primitive punch cards to his thesis where it introduced him to the potential fortunes that were to be made in the emerging software and personal computer industries of the early 1980s.[16] After graduating from college, he then moved back to his parents' home in Lowell and began working for Wang Laboratories as a corporate communications manager and Harris Corp. as a marketing executive.[13][17][18][19]
Business career[edit]




Leonsis speaking to the Tech Council of Maryland


LIST Magazine[edit]
Leonsis left Harris Corporation in March 1981 when, at the age 25, he moved to Florida and began his first business venture. His first venture was publishing LIST, a technology magazine that focused on the then personal computing industry.[20] He raised $1 million in seed capital with his partner Vincent Pica,[21] while working numerous toiling nights to keep the magazine publishing company afloat. The magazine sent ripples in the software world where it was recognized as an essential service for buyers and sellers of hardware and software. Numerous software vendors sought the magazine to promote their products and services which resulted Leonsis selling advertising to them based on a Yellow Pages business model. The first issue of the magazine was a success and sold $50,000 worth of copies when the magazine first got published in the fall of 1982 and was sold near cash registers, bookstores, and newsstands.[20] Just two years later, he sold the company to Thomson Reuters for $40 million netting Leonsis $20 million making him a multimillionaire in the process.[20][22]
AOL[edit]
In 1987, Leonsis established the marketing communications company, Redgate Communications Corporation.[23] When the organization was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1994, Leonsis began working with AOL as a senior executive, remaining with the company for 13 years.[24] Under his leadership, AOL increased its membership from under 800,000 members to over 8 million, while their annual revenue increased from $100 million to $1.5 billion.[25] He held numerous positions at AOL during his years there, completing his tenure and retiring in 2006 as the audience group's president and vice-chairman.[26] As of 2014[update], he serves as vice chairman emeritus of AOL.[citation needed]
Monumental Sports & Entertainment[edit]
Leonsis is the founder, majority owner, chairman and CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the NHL's Washington Capitals, NBA's Washington Wizards, WNBA's Washington Mystics, and the AFL's Washington Valor & Baltimore Brigade. Monumental Sports additionally owns the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.[27] and manages the Kettler Capitals Iceplex and George Mason University's EagleBank Arena.[28] Formed in 2010 by a merger between Leonsis' Lincoln Holdings with Washington Sports & Entertainment, Monumental Sports & Entertainment is the only privately held company in a top-10 market to own and operate three professional sports teams and its arena.[29][30][31] In January 2013 Monumental Sports & Entertainment launched Monumental Network, a digital platform that serves as a hub for Washington's sports and entertainment news.[32] In 2016 a rebranded Monumental Sports Network was launched for digital, mobile and over-the-top platforms.[33] The new Monumental Sports Network offers an OTT service that provides live streaming of Mystics, Valor and AFL Baltimore games as well as additional live events and games. Monumental and CSN Mid-Atlantic formed an advanced media partnership that not only extended CSN’s exclusive media rights to the Capitals and Wizards but also saw Monumental become an equity partner in CSN. Additionally, NBC Sports Group invested in Monumental Sports Network, becoming an equity partner.[34]

Management

Leonsis has a "hands on" approach to management of his sports teams.[35] After purchasing the Wizards, Leonsis criticized the NBA's salary cap at a luncheon with business leaders. He was fined $100,000 by the league, for "unauthorized public comments regarding the league's collective bargaining negotiations."[36] Leonsis has sought to roll-back changes to the Wizards and Capitals franchises that coincided with the opening of the Verizon Center in 1997. In 2007, he changed the Capitals team logo and its colors back to their original red, white, and blue, and in May 2011, received positive responses from media, fans, players and alumni when the Wizards unveiled a similar red, white and blue color scheme, along with uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the team under their former name, the Bullets, when they won the NBA Championship in 1978.[37] Additionally, he had taken under consideration restoring the Bullets name to the franchise,[38] though critics said that this would "send the wrong message" about gun violence in Washington.[39]

Washington Capitals

Leonsis has owned the Washington Capitals since the spring of 1999, and in that timeframe the team has won seven Southeast Division titles, two Presidents’ Trophy and has recorded more than 200 consecutive sellouts at Verizon Center.[31]
In the early years of his ownership, the Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In summer 2001, the Capitals traded for Jaromír Jágr and signed him to what was at the time, the largest contract in NHL history. The trade was enthusiastically well received by fans and over 300 people showed up at Dulles International Airport to greet Jágr when he arrived.[40] After Jágr was traded in 2004, Leonsis was criticized by fans.[41] He was involved in a physical altercation with a fan, who led a mocking chant of Leonsis during the game and hoisted a sign chiding him. In the altercation, Leonsis grabbed and threw the fan to the ground, which also caused a young child to fall to the ground. For his involvement in the scuffle, Leonsis was fined $100,000. He also received a suspension of one week, during which he was prohibited from having any contact with the team.[42] After the incident, Leonsis personally called the fan to apologize for his actions and invited him and his family to watch a game in the owner's box.[43]




Leonsis watches Wizards player John Wall in 2010


In 2009, a season ticket holder informed Leonsis of a homeless man, Scott Lovell, who spent his nights sleeping outside Verizon Center. Leonsis found Lovell a part-time job as a restaurant kitchen worker and provided him with a paid and furnished apartment, a prosthetic leg and Capitals season tickets for life. In return, Lovell vowed to remain clean and sober.[44]
In 2010, journalist Damien Cox, author of the Ovechkin Project, a biography of Alexander Ovechkin, wrote that Leonsis was trying to circumvent the NHL's salary cap when signing Ovechkin's contract.[45] He also alleged that Leonsis was bribing bloggers for positive coverage of the Capitals.[46] Leonsis said that Cox was angry that he did not receive the access to Ovechkin that he wanted and defended his support for the league.[47]
During the 2009–2010 season, the Capitals earned the NHL's President's Trophy as the team that finished with the most points in the league during the regular season.[48]
The 2010–2011 season marked the highest attendance in franchise history, drawing 754,309 fans.[49] The Capitals, like other teams, have raised ticket prices in recent years.[50][51] In 2011, after raising ticket prices for the fourth consecutive year while shrinking the size of beers sold at the Verizon Center, he earned the nickname "Leon$i$".[52] In 2001, Leonsis claimed to have written a computer program that prevented Pittsburgh Penguins fans (the Capitals first-round opponent) from purchasing tickets online. When asked if the actions were unfair, Leonsis stated, "I don't care. I'm going to keep doing it."[53] Again in 2009, he received criticism for preventing visiting team fans from purchasing Capitals playoff tickets.[54]
In the face of community opposition, Leonsis has persisted with a plan to expand the billboards around the Verizon Center.[55] Critics said the signage would make the arena more garish and cheapen DC's Chinatown, Leonsis said it was necessary to raise an additional $20 to 30 million in annual revenue, and a sports expert explained that "an owner saddled with underperforming teams is under greater pressure to find income sources."[56][57][58] Leonsis persevered and in March 2013 construction of the new signs were announced.[57]
In 2013, Leonsis received a letter about Jack Dibler, a lifelong Capitals fan who had recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In response, Leonsis sent Dibler a package that included a signed Alexander Ovechkin jersey and a letter inviting Dibler and his family to a game.[59]

Washington Wizards

Leonsis became the majority owner of the Washington Wizards in June 2010, inheriting a team that had 26 wins and 56 losses during the previous season.[60] Leonsis has taken a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website.[61] On May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms and logo. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years.[62] During Leonsis’ tenure as owner, the Wizards have compiled a promising young nucleus of players, including John Wall (No. 1 pick in the 2010 NBA Draft), Bradley Beal (No. 3 pick in the 2012 NBA Draft) and Otto Porter Jr. (No. 3 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft). They have also acquired veterans like Nenê and Marcin Gortat via trade.[63][64] Leonsis was chairman of the NBA's 2014 media committee that negotiated a nine-year expanded partnership with Turner Broadcasting and The Walt Disney Company.[65]
In February 2016, construction started on a new practice facility for the Wizards.[66] The development was paid for by DC taxpayers and District-funded Events DC while Leonsis' contribution to the $55 million cost was considered ceremonial.[66] The Wizards also announced that they would raise ticket prices for a third consecutive year.[66]

Washington Mystics

Leonsis purchased the rights to the Mystics around the same time he took over the Wizards.

Washington Valor and Baltimore Brigade

On March 10, 2016, Leonsis announced that he was purchasing an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League (AFL) to play at the Verizon Center beginning in 2017. On March 16, 2016, the announcement was made official by AFL commissioner Scott Butera.[67] On July 14, 2016, the team name was revealed as the Washington Valor.[68] On November 14, 2016, Monumental announced that it had acquired an AFL team that would begin play in 2017 in Baltimore.[69] The team name was later revealed as the Baltimore Brigade.

In early 2011, Leonsis purchased a 13-acre estate in Potomac, Maryland.
