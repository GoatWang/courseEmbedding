Michael Gursha
Entrepreneur-in-Residence
Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship

Michael Gursha is an entrepreneur, mentor, angel investor and executive. 
He joined the Newhouse School from Curemark LLC, a New York-based biotech company focused on the treatment of autism and other neurological disorders, where he served as vice president of strategic initiatives. Michael was one of the initial team members at Curemark and, over the years, held various positions with the company, including director of business development. 
Early in his career, Michael's interest in technology led him to Google, where, at age 18, he spent two summers working in new business development at the Mountain View, California headquarters. During his time there, he assisted the team responsible for improving the Google Search Index and supported the director of business development on early-stage partnerships for Google Health. He later spent several months at Time Inc. Home Entertainment, working mostly on new product development with major brands such as People, InStyle, Sports Illustrated and Time magazine.
While a student at Syracuse University, Michael co-founded the social media startup VouchBoard and was a founding team member of Dream Water, which won first place and $25,000 in the Panasci Business Plan Competition.
Michael is an advisory board member for the Accelerator program at South By Southwest and an advisory council member for New York On Tech. He graduated magna cum laude with dual degrees in television, radio and film from Newhouse and entrepreneurship and emerging enterprises from the Whitman School of Management.

Jordan Newhouse
English Copywriter












Ok, what's the big idea?Without understanding the idea behind your brand and why it exists among a sea of others, you may be in for stormy weather. You certainly can’t convey what makes your particular product, service or skill special without that insight.Whether it's high-tech aeronautical engineering, bespoke Italian tailoring or glow-in-the-dark toothpaste – it’s essential to communicate the feeling of what your brand ‘does’ effectively.This is what I do. I work with art directors, design teams and project managers to help brands speak clearly and passionately to people around the world. I’m a copywriter. Language is the tool I use to deliver your vision to others. Below are a few examples of work for larger clients (click on the icon to view):








Royal Institute of Technology



Copywriting for one of Sweden’s most prestigious academic institutions requires the ability to write formally, on technical subject matter, while maintaining an approachable simplicity. The work reflects the ethos and pedigree of the university, hopefully inspiring a new generation of international students and innovators.








Swedish Cosmetics



My contributions to this well-known Swedish cosmetics company involved building fragrance brands with a dedicated team of art directors and veteran French marketing managers. Conceptualizing, naming and bringing to life new scents proved a rewarding challenge.








World Wide Fund for Nature



Often my job consists of refining language in an already strong campaign or idea. I like editing. The WWF takes part in innumerable environmental projects – this one involved the preservation of the Baltic Sea.








Citibank



In 2010 I worked with British design legend Michael Wolff, trying to restore faith and momentum in the badly shaken financial sector. There were several projects for the Citi brand, all of which were aimed at helping them clarify and shape where they wanted to go in the future.Other clients include: Sandvik, Skanska, Swedavia, Story Films AB, Nordic Gaming Group, EHF, Citigroup, Michael Wolff & Co. and more.
