At KKR we are particularly proud of our global, integrated approach. We operate as one firm, leveraging all of our businesses and partnering across the firm on behalf of our fund investors and the companies in which we invest. KKR’s Private Equity platform invests in and partners with industry-leading franchises and companies poised for significant improvement or growth that attract high-quality management teams. Moreover, we are disciplined investors, focusing on long-term business fundamentals.
Working Together
We look to partner closely and cooperatively with management teams and entrepreneurs that have track records of success. We believe that the combination of our industry knowledge, investment experience, and operational expertise provides KKR with an edge in identifying and creating value in investment opportunities. Our strategy is not only to work as partners with the management of our portfolio companies, but also to assist in the operations of our businesses and leverage all of the resources of our global platform.
Ways We Invest
In addition to traditional management buyouts and build-ups, the business seeks to find opportunities to provide growth capital, as well as minority investments, and public toe hold investments where we can partner with public companies and leverage our industry expertise and operational capabilities.
Our Experience
Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 280 private equity investments in portfolio companies with approximately $542 billion of total entreprise value as of March 31, 2017.
On March 6, 2017, we announced the closing of our latest Americas Private Equity fund, KKR Americas XII Fund, a $13.9 billion fund focused on opportunistic investments in private equity-related transactions primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. More information can be found here.


On June 1, 2017, we announced the closing of our latest Asia Private Equity fund, KKR Asian Fund III, a $9.3 billion fund focused on investments in private equity transactions across the Asia Pacific region. More information can be found here.



KKR’s Private Equity team sees investment opportunities across the following industries by region:

                KKR & Co. LP provides investment and private equity asset management services. It manages investments across multiple asset classes includes private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds. The firm operates business through four business segments: Private Markets, Public Markets and Capital Markets and Principal Activities. The Private Markets segment is comprised of the global private equity business, which manages and sponsors a group of investment funds and vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. The Public Markets segment is comprised primarily of the company fixed income businesses which manage capital in liquid credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds, and less liquid credit products, such as mezzanine debt, special situation assets, rescue financings, distressed assets, debtor-in-possession financings and exit financings. The Capital Markets segment combines the assets acquired in the Combination Transaction with the company's global capital markets business. The Principal Activities segment manages the firm's own assets and deploys capital to support and grow the businesses. The company was founded by Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts on June 25, 2007 and is headquartered in New York, NY.
