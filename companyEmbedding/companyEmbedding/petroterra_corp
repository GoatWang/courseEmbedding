Utah: The Future of American Energy
Utah’s long history of oil and gas exploration dates back 1891, when natural gas was discovered in Farmington Bay during the drilling of a water well. Of course, it wasn’t until more recently – 1948 – that the first large commercial well was drilled.  Since then, Utah has been recognized as a major oil and gas powerhouse. By 1960, Utah was the 10th largest oil-producing state in the country.2 In 2013, USA Today listed Utah as the eighth most oil-rich state.3

Utah's Oil and Gas Production 2015
From production reports submitted and processed as of September 17, 2015.

 
Based on increasing number of drilling permits, oil and gas E&P activity in Utah shows steady growth.






Utah Region Highlights


As of 2011, Utah reported proven oil reserves of 504 million barrels.1
Utah is the eighth most oil-rich state.
Utah is home to four productive oil plays.  The Central Utah Thrust Belt is the most recently discovered of the four.
The Sevier and Beaver Oil Prospects are located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt.
Millions in upgrades to roads, refineries, and other Utah infrastructure are planned to assist with expected increases in oil and gas production.










 
Four Oil and Gas Producing Areas in Utah
Four major areas host Utah’s oil plays:  Utah/Wyoming Thrust Belt, Central Utah Thrust Belt, Uinta Basin, and Paradox Basin.5
Until recently, most of the activity in Utah centered around the Utah/Wyoming Thrust Belt, Uinta Basin, and Paradox Basin.  However, since the exciting new Utah Central Thrust Belt area was tapped by Wolverine Oil in 2004, the fourth major Utah play has garnered more attention.

Thrust Belt In Utah
The thrust belt in Utah is part of a larger belt structure that runs from Northern Alaska to Central America, called the Cordilleran Orogenic Belt.  In southern Canada, the structure has been a well-known oil and gas producer for several decades. 
There are two productive areas of the thrust belt in Utah.  The first was tapped in northeastern Utah with the discovery of Pineview along the Utah/Wyoming Thrust Belt in 1975.25 Three decades later, the discovery of Covenant Field opened up a second area: the Central Utah Thrust Belt.


There are four major oil and gas plays in Utah.  The newest is the central Utah Thrust Belt.


Timeline: The Thrust Belt in Utah


1975

"The discovery of oil in the Jurassic Nugget Sandstone at Pineview is the first significant discovery in the Cordilleran hinge belt."
– Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, 1975 Symposium6



1982

"The portion of the overthrust belt located in northeastern Utah, western Wyoming and southeastern Idaho is considered by the oil and gas industry to be the hottest new oil and gas province in the continental United States."
 – The Geological Survey of Wyoming7



2005

"Stunning Utah oil, gas discovery focuses spotlight on hingeline:  A recent new field discovery and first offset operated by Wolverine Gas & Oil Co…appears to have exceeded 200,000 bbl of oil since May 2004."
 – Oil and Gas Journal8

2010

"The Middle Jurassic Twin Creek Limestone in the Utah/Wyoming thrust belt has produced over 15 million BO and 93 BCFG."
 – Utah.gov9




The Sevier and Beaver Oil Prospects are located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt, 18 miles from the Covenant Field discovery.
 
Transportation and Utah’s Oil and Gas Production
In order to ensure that Utah oil and gas production reaches its potential, Utah policymakers and business leaders are taking steps to ensure that oil and gas exploration, drilling, and processing companies have access to transportation. 
There are currently three major oil and gas transportation options in the state:
Road 
One of Utah’s main transportation arteries is US-40, a 2,285-mile10 highway that runs from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Park City, Utah.11 The majority of Utah’s oil and gas processing facilities are located along US-40, so as oil and gas production steps up in all areas of the state, it will be important to ensure that this highway can handle an increase in traffic.
In April of 2012, the Utah Transportation Commission announced plans for a $5 million highway improvement project intended to prevent traffic and congestion due to increased oil and gas exploration/production.12
In addition, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) is planning another $10 million in upgrades to US-40, which will take place over the next several years.  Upgrades will include the addition of passing lanes, as well as general improvements that will enable the road to handle increased traffic and heavier vehicles13 associated with oil and gas transportation. 
Refineries
Utah is home to five refineries.  Their capacity is 176,000 barrels a day.  This means the state is a net importer to its refineries,14 and local refineries could therefore handle more production from local sources (versus the Canadian and out-of-state crude which accounts for a high percentage of the crude they are currently handling).
All of the state’s major oil and gas players – including HollyFrontier, Tesoro, and Chevron – have all announced plans to step up their processing capabilities in the state.16  In addition, Rock River Resources announced plans for the $230 million Green River Refinery project.15  Expansions or improvements to the state’s refineries will enable them to process three times the paraffinic-based crude as they could six years ago.17 This expanded capacity bodes well for producers in Utah, who will likely have little need to ship their oil to other states for processing.



Pipeline 
Utah is home to more than 22,000 miles of oil and natural gas pipeline18 — and that number is expected to increase to keep up with demands from increased production in the state. 



Current and future Utah pipeline expansions include: 

Expansion of the Mid-America Pipeline (MAPL) system.  The MAPL expansion, expected to be completed and operational in the second quarter of 2014,19 is a 95-mile natural gas pipeline in western Colorado/eastern Utah.  The expansion would increase the MAPL system’s capacity by 15,000 BBLs per day.21
The Western Expansion Project III.  Approved by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in July of 2013, the Western Expansion Project III is a 234-mile natural gas pipeline that will run from New Mexico to South Texas.22  Although it won’t be constructed in Utah, the new pipeline will be used to transport NGLS from the state’s processing plants.23

Rail
As domestic oil and natural gas production steadily increases in the Rocky Mountain region, oil and gas companies have turned to rail as a fast, reliable, and cost-effective way to transport crude oil and natural gas to other parts of the country.
The amount of crude oil transported by rail has increased steadily in the past several years:   In 2009, about 10,000 train cars transported crude oil. By the end of 2012, that number had jumped up to just over 230,000 carloads.24

PetroTerra Corp.: A Paid Promotion That Will Crash And Burn - PetroTerra Corp. (OTCMKTS:PTRA-OLD1) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PetroTerra Corp.: A Paid Promotion That Will Crash And BurnOct.14.15 | About: PetroTerra Corp. (PTRA) Hunter Straus Long-term horizon, Growth, long/short equitySummaryPTRA is being promoted by the Wall Street Report.The company's balance sheet shows only $2,322 in cash.Insiders own over 50% of the common stock.The company's latest 10-K lists only one employee.I have attempted to contact management regarding the ongoing promotional activity.Background
PetroTerra Corporation (OTCQB:PTRA) has recently been the subject of a series of paid promotional advertisements from Wall Street Report . Most recently, on October 13 and October 11th, promotional emails went out which disclosed that Wall Street Report was being compensated $150,000 for the promotion.
Like nearly all companies that have experienced paid promotions, PTRA has abysmal financials, an unrealistic business plan, and few employees. I believe that PTRA common stock is near worthless, and in the weeks following the promotion, it will be trading far below its closing price of $1.12 on October 13, 2015.
Business and Website
On page F-4 of the company's most recent 10-Q it reads,
PetroTerra Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008. The Company is an independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property (or property leases enabling us to explore and exploit such property) that we believe may contain extractable oil and/or gas. The Company plans to identify, evaluate and acquire oil and gas exploration and development opportunities primarily within the United States. The Company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.
So it's an oil and gas exploration company -- sound straight forward enough. Additionally, the company has a nice, well-manicured website which has a lot of pretty pictures and even a nifty interactive brochure that gives the impression that this is a small, but ambitious little oil and gas exploration company.
However, the company's website hasn't been updated since the beginning of July, yet the stock price has exploded in the absence of any publicized company developments. Surely, if something major happened, the company's PR would want to keep its website updated to inform its shareholders, but there isn't anything new here.

This isn't the only curious thing about -- if we take a deeper look at the company's SEC filings, it's clear that there is a major inconsistency between what appears on the company's website and what is possible in its financial situation.
Financials and Insider Ownership
PTRA's financials are abysmal and indicate that the company is in no position to accomplish any meaningful business goals, and make it impossible to justify its current market cap of $28 million.
The company's balance sheet shows just $2,322 in cash and $737,500 in "oil and gas exploration." Additionally, the balance sheet also shows a Bank Overdraft of $103,970, indicating that the company owes its bank for withdrawing too much cash -- not a good sign.

The Statement of Operations and Statement of Cash Flows are equally depressing, and show a net loss of $93,803 and $117,678 cash used in the company's operations. The company's Statement of Cash Flows also shows that the company received $120,000 from the sale of common stock.


In light of these financial figures, it comes as no surprise that the company's accounting firm as inserted a "Going Concern" statement into page 8 of the most recent 10-Q which reads,

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $1,461,063 as of June 30, 2015 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities, which have arisen from normal business operations as they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand loans from our director and/or private placements of common stock.
If one looks at the Executive Compensation section on page 32 of the most recent 10-K, it shows that the CEO received a salary of $120,000 in 2015. Perhaps this explains why the company plans to continue to fund its operations through the sale of stock, and may explain the company's bank overdraft.
Additionally, the company's latest 10-K filed on June 30, 2015 states that the company only has one full-time employee, and none of the filings since then indicate that the company has gone on a hiring spree. Beyond that, over 50% of the company's outstanding shares are held by the CEO.

Promotion
As mentioned before, PTRA has been promoted through a series of paid promotional emails from Wall Street Report, which also set up a colorful landing page.


A third party identified as "Mass Peak Ltd." disclosed paying $150,000 for the promotional emails. While there is no mention of Mass Peak Ltd in PTRA's filings, it's clear that somebody is trying to create a market, likely in order to unload his or her shares.

Following these promotions, PTRA stock rose from $0.59 at the end of October 9th to close at $1.12 on October 13. Volume increased accordingly, as the average 3-month trading volume of the company's stock is just over 3,800, and just over 791,300 shares were exchanged on October 13.

Most recently, The Wall Street Report promoted Black Stallion Oil & Gas (OTCQB:BLKG), another poorly capitalized entity that has since plummeted from when the promotion came out.
Conclusion
PTRA is yet another example of a paid promotion that touts massive potential for unsuspecting investors, but the product being advertised has no substance. The company's filings have all of the red flags that I could imagine: abysmal financials, hardly any employees, and massive insider ownership.
While there is no certain link between PTRA's management and the promotional activity, it's clear that a major shareholder is looking to unload his or her shares on to unsuspecting retail investors. The stock is worth nearly nothing, and over the course of the next several months, I fully expect that PTRA stock will be trading far below its current price of $1.12.

Company Overview












































MISSION STATEMENT


To deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for oil and gas resources vital to the world's energy needs.






PetroTerra Corp (OTCQB: PTRA) is a publicly traded oil and gas exploration and development company based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The company is engaged in identifying, evaluating, and developing early-stage onshore oil and gas opportunities in North America. Our strategy is to focus on assets that are located in high-potential, proven basins that can reduce the geological risks involved in exploration projects.
Our current focus is the Sevier and Beaver Oil Prospects in Utah’s Central Thrust Belt. The Sevier and Beaver Oil Prospects could offer attractive oil discovery within the Navajo Sandstone as the initial target in this high potential proven basin.
Overseeing the development of an oil field from prospects to profits requires a knowledgeable, experienced, and strategic leadership team capable of delivering results. PetroTerra has assembled the human talent necessary to execute this goal.

	Notes
	To The Financial Statements






	June
	30, 2015






	(Unaudited)





	 





	1.
	ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS





	 




	PetroTerra
	Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008. The Company is an
	independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property (or property leases enabling us to explore
	and exploit such property) that we believe may contain extractable oil and/or gas. The Company plans to identify, evaluate and
	acquire oil and gas exploration and development opportunities primarily within the United States. The Company has not generated
	any revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.




	 





	2.
	GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
	and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since
	inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $1,461,063 as of June 30, 2015 and further losses are anticipated in the development
	of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue
	as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary
	financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities, which have arisen from normal business operations as they come due.
	Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand loans from our director and/or
	private placements of common stock.




	 





	3.
	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
	States of America and are presented in US dollars.




	 




	These
	statements reflect all adjustments, including of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary
	for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these unaudited interim financial statements
	be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2015 and notes thereto included
	in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K. The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of its
	annual and interim reports.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity date of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash
	equivalents.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates and Assumptions





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
	management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In management’s opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair
	statement of the results for the interim periods have been made and all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

	3.
	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	 





	Foreign
	Currency Translation





	 




	The
	Company’s functional currency and its reporting currency is the United States dollar.




	 





	Stock
	Split





	 




	On
	July 1, 2015, the Company


	filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a
	reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 2.5 (the “Reverse Stock
	Split”).




	 




	As
	a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s authorized shares of common stock were decreased from 100,000,000 to
	40,000,000 shares and its authorized shares of preferred stock were decreased from 10,000,000 to 4,000,000 shares. Upon the effectiveness
	of the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on July 1, 2015, the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock
	was decreased from approximately 66,125,000 to 26,450,000 shares, all with a par value of $0.001. The Company has no outstanding
	shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, all share and per share information has been restated to retroactively show the effect
	of the Reverse Stock Split.




	 





	Stock-based
	Compensation





	 




	In
	September 2009, the FASB issued ASC-718, “Stock Compensation”. ASC-718 requires all share-based payments to employees,
	including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of
	the award. Under ASC-718, the Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments,
	the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	Income
	taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
	future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
	and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
	using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.




	 





	Basic
	and Diluted Loss Per Share





	 




	The
	Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both
	basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
	net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period.
	Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss
	per share excludes all potential shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive
	instruments and accordingly basic loss and diluted loss per share are equal.




	 





	Fiscal
	Periods





	 




	The
	Company’s fiscal year end is March 31.

	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	The
	Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ACS - 605, “Revenue recognition”, ASC-605 requires that four basic
	criteria be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred;
	(3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and
	(4) are based on management’s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the
	collectability of those amounts. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other
	adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the
	product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that
	the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.




	 





	Oil
	and Gas





	 




	The
	Company complies with ASC 932, “Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas”. The Company has capitalized exploratory well
	costs, and has determined that there are no suspended well costs that should be impaired. The Company reviews its long-lived assets
	for impairments when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.




	 





	Website





	 




	The
	Company capitalizes the costs associated with the development of the Company’s website pursuant to ASC - 350, “Goodwill
	and Other”. Other costs related to the maintenance of the website are expensed as incurred. Amortization is provided over
	the estimated useful lives of three years using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes. The Company commenced
	amortization upon completion of the Company’s fully operational website. Amortization expense for the three months ended
	June 30, 2015 and 2014 totaled $2,192 and $2,192, respectively.




	 





	Property
	and Equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and
	equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization
	of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes at rates based on the following
	estimated useful lives:

	Advertising





	 




	The
	Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expenses incurred. The Company incurred $0 in advertising costs
	during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	In
	May 2014, the FASB amended the ASC and created Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to clarify the principles for
	recognizing revenue. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017and must be adopted using either
	a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. We have
	not yet determined the effects of this new guidance on our financial statements.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued a new U.S. GAAP accounting standard that provides guidance about management’s responsibility
	to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related
	footnote disclosures. The new accounting standard requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going
	concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. The new accounting
	standard is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
	Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated
	financial statements.




	 





	4.
	ACQUISITION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES





	 




	On
	November 18, 2013, the Company entered into an assignment of lease (the “Agreement”) whereby Ardmore Investments Inc.
	(“Ardmore”) assigned to the Company its rights under a certain purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”),
	dated August 8, 2013, between Ardmore and Pioneer Oil and Gas (“Pioneer”) involving the sale of 5,905.54 acres of
	oil and gas leases located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah and currently owned by Pioneer
	(the “Leases”). Per the terms of the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore an aggregate of 200,000 shares (100,000 share
	installments) of our common stock on November 18, 2013 and April 12, 2014 in order to complete the assignment. Furthermore, on
	December 12, 2013, February 12, 2014 and April 12, 2014, the Company made three installment payments of $100,000 each to Pioneer.
	Upon completion of the final installment the leases were conveyed to the Company.




	 




	Due
	to the lack of an active market of the Company’s common stock, the fair value of the common stock issued to Ardmore was
	determined based on the price at which the Company’s shares were most recently being sold in a private placement transaction.





	 






	5.
	COMMON STOCK






	 





	The
	Company’s authorized capital consists of 40,000,000 shares of common stock and 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock, both
	with a par value of $0.001 per share.




	 




	On
	July 1, 2015, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio
	of 1 for 2.5. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s authorized shares of common stock were decreased from
	100,000,000 to 40,000,000 shares and its authorized shares of preferred stock were decreased from 10,000,000 to 4,000,000 shares.
	Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, which occurred on July 1, 2015, the Company’s issued and outstanding
	shares of common stock was decreased from 66,124,593 to 26,449,868 shares, all with a par value of $0.001. The Company has no
	outstanding shares of preferred stock. Accordingly, all share and per share information has been restated in this Report to retroactively
	show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split.



	 



	On
	April 27, 2015, the Company sold a total of 21,918 shares of common stock to an investor for gross proceeds of $40,000.




	 




	On
	June 1, 2015, the Company sold a total of 58,823 shares of common stock to an investor for gross proceeds of $50,000.




	 




	On
	June 12, 2015, the Company sold a total of 52,174 shares of common stock to an investor for gross proceeds of $30,000.




	 




	As
	of June 30, 2015, the Company had 26,449,868 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

	future years’ taxable income through 2034. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been
	recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur. Accordingly, the Company has
	recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.

	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS





	 




	The
	Company has received advances from certain of its officers and other related parties to meet short term working capital needs.
	These advances may not have formal repayment terms or arrangements. As of June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015, the total amount loaned
	to the Company by a director was $10,118. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.




	 




	The
	Company has an employment agreement with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer whereby the Company provides for compensation
	of $10,000 per month. A total salary of $30,000 expensed during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. The total balance
	due to the Chief Executive Officer for accrued salaries at June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015, was $15,000 and $25,000, respectively.

	GENERAL






	 





	We
	are a development stage company that plans to identify, evaluate and acquire oil and gas exploration and development opportunities
	primarily in the United States.




	 




	We
	were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008 as “Loran Connection Corp.” We were formed
	to provide a variety of services in the area of individual and group tourism and business support in Ukraine. We subsequently
	filed a resale registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 28, 2009 which was declared effective
	on October 28, 2009.




	 




	On
	January 25, 2012, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation to, among other things, change our name to “PetroTerra
	Corp.” We changed our name to reflect a proposed change in our business operations.




	 




	On
	October 2, 2013, in connection with a change of control in the management of the Company, the Company began its current business
	operations in the oil and gas sector.




	 




	On
	April 12, 2014, we completed our acquisition of certain property Leases held by Ardmore Investments Inc. for property owned by
	Pioneer Oil and Gas covering 5,905.54 acres of land located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County,
	Utah (the “Utah Properties”).




	 




	On
	July 1, 2015, we filed a certificate of change to effect a 1 for 2.5 reverse stock split of our authorized and our outstanding
	shares of common stock and preferred stock.

	CURRENT
	BUSINESS OPERATIONS





	 




	The
	Company is an independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property (or property leases enabling
	us to explore and exploit such property) that we believe may contain extractable oil and/or gas. We will seek to acquire property
	in the United States and will initially focus on properties in the Central Utah Thrust Belt, including the Utah Properties.




	 




	In
	order to determine whether to acquire a property, our management team will consider, among other things, whether oil and/or gas
	had previously been discovered at or near the property, whether the property is located atop a proven oil and natural gas basin
	and whether oil and/or gas has been exploited from the property. We will also review any materials that are made available to
	us by the owner of the property, including well logs, production records, and other seismic, geological and geophysical information.
	Additionally, we will compare analogues of successes and failures from seismic and drilling data in the region. Once we have completed
	our initial review, we will determine whether to acquire the property. Once we acquire a property (or the right to explore and
	exploit a property) we will conduct a full evaluation of the property, including, without limitation, obtaining an MHA Petroleum
	Consultants, LLC technical report (an “MHA Technical Report”). We expect that the cost of such an evaluation will
	be approximately $30,000. Using the data from the evaluation, and with the assistance of third party geophysicists, petroleum
	engineers, geologists and other third party technical consultants that we may hire, we will determine whether further exploration
	of the property should be undertaken. If management elects to continue the exploration of the property, we will conduct additional
	due diligence, including, but not limited to, potentially obtaining existing 2-D seismic lines on and around our properties and
	commencing an integrated geologic-geophysical evaluation and mapping effort. Following our due diligence analysis, management
	will determine if the Company should attempt to conduct its own 2-D or 3-D seismic coverage to evaluate the properties further.
	Thereafter, management will determine if the Company should attempt to extract oil and/or gas from the property. If management
	elects to do so, we will engage a separate third party to extract (whether by conventional means, horizontal drilling and/or fracturing)
	the oil and/or gas. We expect that recent improvements in drilling and fracturing methods will augment our ability to discover
	and extract oil and gas.




	 




	By
	utilizing this business model, we believe that we can reduce the risks involved in each exploration project. Specifically, we
	believe that by compartmentalizing each step of the extraction process we will be able to limit the costs associated with each
	project and maintain the flexibility to abandon any projects that management believes will not yield sufficient amounts of oil
	and/or gas.




	 




	In
	January 2014 we hired a third party independent contractor to provide insight and to assist in the development of a plan regarding
	the exploration of any properties that we acquire. In March 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to provide geologic
	consulting services to the Company. In March 2014 we also obtained an MHA Technical Report on the Utah Properties. In September
	2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to review and process both the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets
	that existed on our leased Utah Properties. In November 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to perform a comprehensive
	gravity survey on our Utah Properties which was completed in December 2014 and the results of such survey were interpreted in
	February 2015. We have since engaged a third party contractor to create a geologic model of the Utah Properties. Each of the foregoing
	actions have been implemented as part of our continuing effort to conduct a full evaluation of the Utah Properties. For more information,
	see “Recent Developments” below.




	 





	Recent
	Developments





	 




	On
	November 18, 2013, the Company entered into the Agreement whereby Ardmore assigned to us its rights under a certain Purchase Agreement,
	dated August 8, 2013, between Ardmore and Pioneer involving the sale of 5,905.54 acres of three separate BLM Management oil and
	gas Leases located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah and currently owned by Pioneer. Per
	the terms of the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore 100,000 shares of our common stock on November 18, 2013, and, in order to complete
	the assignment contemplated by the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore an additional 100,000 shares of our common stock upon the transfer
	to us of ownership in the Leases, which occurred on April 12, 2014. Furthermore, the Company made three installment payments of
	$100,000 each to Pioneer pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Leases were conveyed to the Company on April 10,
	2014.

	On
	September 16, 2014, the Company appointed Kurt Reinecke as its Chief Operating Officer pursuant to an independent contractor agreement
	(the “Reinecke Agreement”) with Arrow Peak Minerals and Royalty LLC (“Arrow”). Under the Reinecke Agreement,
	Mr. Reinecke will perform the following services for the Company in his role as Chief Operating Officer: (i) oversee and coordinate
	the Company’s exploration plan; (ii) coordinate any other land related task as may be identified from time to time by John
	Barton, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer; and (iii) perform any other services that a chief operating officer may perform.
	The Reinecke Agreement is for a term of one year and will pay Arrow an aggregate of $90,000 over the term. Arrow is also entitled
	to receive an aggregate of 80,000 shares of common stock to be earned as follows: (i) 20,000 shares upon execution of the Reinecke
	Agreement; (ii) 20,000 shares upon the six month anniversary of the commencement of the Reinecke Agreement; and (iii) 40,000 shares
	upon the one year anniversary of the commencement of the Reinecke Agreement.




	 




	On
	September 28, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson Solutions, LLC (“Thompson”) to review and process both the public
	domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our leased Utah Properties. The purpose of this review was to identify
	major structures and geologic trends of interest on the Utah Properties. Based on the results of this analysis, on November 21,
	2014, the Company engaged Magee Geophysical Services LLC (“Magee”) to perform a comprehensive gravity survey on our
	Utah Properties. The gravity survey was conducted from November 22, 2014 through December 9, 2014 and cost the Company approximately
	$55,000. Pursuant to the survey, a total of 737 new gravity stations were identified on a nominal quarter mile grid and the data
	acquired was merged with re-processed public domain data including about 630 stations located in and around the main grid. Upon
	completion of Magee’s gravity survey, on December 8, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson to further process the data obtained
	by Magee and to provide custom processing and mapping of such data. On February 6, 2015, Thompson completed their interpretation
	of the gravity survey. The Company will pay to Thompson $15,500 for its services.




	 




	On
	February 2, 2015 the Company engaged PRISEM Geoscience Consulting LLC (“PRISEM”) to provide recommendations on a work
	plan for creating a geologic model of the Utah Properties. This structural analysis will include, but not be limited to, collecting
	well data from relevant wells in the area and construction of possibly 1 to 2 balanced cross sections through and/or near the
	prospective acreage. PRISEM will also make a seismic database search and provide recommendations for licensing of existing 2-D
	datasets. If seismic data is purchased PRISEM will recommend processors to reprocess the data using modern techniques relevant
	to complex structural environment as the Utah Properties.




	 




	The
	Company initiated these technical steps in line with our business plan of evaluating our properties step by step before proceeding
	to the next phase of extraction. The Company plans to co-ordinate its technical efforts towards selecting an initial potential
	drillsite that management believes may be capable of producing oil or natural gas in commercial quantities on the Utah Properties.




	 





	RESULTS
	OF OPERATIONS





	 




	Our
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
	unable to continue our operation.




	 




	We
	expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital
	through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.





	 






	Three
	Month Period Ended June 30, 2015 Compared to the Three Month Period Ended June 30, 2014.





	 




	Our
	net loss for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 was $93,803 compared to a net loss of $88,795 during the three-month period
	ended June 30, 2014. We did not generate any revenue during the three month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.




	 








	5










	 







	 




	This
	change in net loss was primarily the result of the following:




	 





	Lease
	property and exploration costs





	 




	During
	the three months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred lease property and exploration costs of $13,417, a decrease of $3,413 compared
	to the prior year period amount of $16,830 resulting primarily from a decrease in consulting costs.




	 





	General
	and administrative costs





	 




	During
	the three month period ended June 30, 2015, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $37,933 compared to $39,179 incurred
	during the three-month period ended June 30, 2014. The general and administrative expense incurred during the three months ended
	June 30, 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to compensation to our Chief Executive Officer of $30,000, with a nominal difference
	between corporate overhead and travel costs between periods.




	 





	Professional
	Fees





	 




	During
	the three months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred professional fees of $42,453 relating to our equity financings, operations and
	public company compliance. The legal and accounting fees associated with these activities amounted to $20,374 and $9,046, respectively,
	and the corporate and investor relations fees associated with these activities amounted to $13,033. During the three months ended
	June 30, 2014, we incurred professional fees of $32,786 relating to our equity financings, the acquisition of the Leases from
	Ardmore and public company compliance. The legal and accounting fees associated with these activities amounted to $25,423 and
	$3,710, respectively, and the corporate and investor relations fees associated with these activities amounted to $3,653.




	 





	Weighted
	average number of shares





	 




	The
	weighted average number of shares outstanding was 26,361,403 and 25,643,116 for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and
	2014, respectively. The weighted average number of shares is an average calculation incorporating changes to the shares outstanding
	within the period reported and has been restated to retroactively show the effect of the Reverse Stock Split on July 1, 2015.




	 




	LIQUIDITY
	AND CAPITAL RESOURCES




	 




	As
	of June, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,322. As of March 31, 2015, we had no cash and cash equivalents.




	 




	We
	have experienced losses of $93,803 and $88,795 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and have an accumulated
	deficit of $1,461,063 at June 30, 2015. In addition, we have not completed our efforts to establish a stable recurring source
	of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future. There
	is no assurances that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for our near term requirements or the long-term
	development and exploration of our Leases. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going
	concern”.




	 




	Since
	inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock, receiving aggregate net proceeds
	totaling $1,087,500 from the period beginning October 1, 2013 through June 30, 2015, including the current fiscal year securities
	purchase agreements described in more details below.

	Securities
	Purchase Agreements





	 




	The
	Company entered into several securities purchase agreements with a single investor pursuant to Regulation S promulgated under
	the Securities Act whereby the Company sold shares of its common stock to the investor. A list of the securities purchase agreements
	that were entered into during this quarter is below:




	 




	On
	April 27, 2015, the Company sold a total of 21,918 shares of common stock to an investor for gross proceeds of $40,000.




	 




	On
	June 1, 2015, the Company sold a total of 58,823 shares of common stock to an investor for gross proceeds of $50,000.




	 




	On
	June 12, 2015, the Company sold a total of 52,174 shares of common stock to an investor for gross proceeds of $30,000.





	 






	Three
	Months Ended June 30, 2015 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2014





	 





	Cash
	Flows from Operating Activities





	 




	We
	have generated negative cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, net cash flows used in
	operating activities was $117,678 consisting of a net loss of $93,803, offset by depreciation and amortization of $2,423, a decrease
	of $17,738 in accounts payables and accrued liabilities, a decrease of $10,000 for accrued officer compensation, and an increase
	in prepaid expenses of $1,875. Furthermore, as of March 31, 2015 we had a cash overdraft repayment of $435.




	 




	For
	the three months ended June 30, 2014, net cash flows used in operating activities was $80,225 consisting of a net loss of $88,795,
	offset by depreciation and amortization of $2,325, an increase in accounts payable of $11,215 and a decrease of $5,000 for accrued
	officer compensation. These differences were primarily the result of the operations of the Company increasing upon the acquisition
	of the leases and business formation as an Oil and Gas company.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Investing Activities





	 




	We
	used cash from investing activities in the three months ended June 30, 2014 for the lease installment of $100,000. There were
	no investing activities in the three months ended June 30, 2015.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Financing Activities





	 




	We
	have financed our operations primarily from either cash advances or the issuance of equity instruments. We generated cash from
	financing activities of $120,000 and $172,500 in the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from the issuance
	of common stock.




	 




	PLAN
	OF OPERATION AND FUNDING




	 




	We
	expect that our working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further
	issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.




	 










	7










	 







	 




	Our
	existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are not adequate to fund our operations
	over the next twelve months and the Company is dependent upon additional equity raises. We have no lines of credit or other bank
	financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of our private placement of equity.
	In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures
	relating to: (i) development and exploration expenses through independent consultants; and (ii) financing related costs. We believe
	that we will need $800,000 in additional capital to meet long-term operating requirements for the next twelve months. Additional
	issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders. Further, such securities
	might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable
	terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage
	of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities that could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
	We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do
	not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form
	of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our director,
	although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our director concerning
	these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.






	 




	OFF-BALANCE
	SHEET ARRANGEMENTS




	 




	As
	of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
	have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
	liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.




	 




	GOING
	CONCERN




	 




	The
	independent auditors’ report accompanying our March 31, 2015 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
	to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result
	from this uncertainty.

	CERTIFICATION




	 




	I,
	John Barton, Chief Executive Officer of PETROTERRA CORP., certify that:




	 






	1.




	I
	have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q PETROTERRA CORP.;






	 




	 




	 






	2.




	Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
	to the period covered by quarterly report;






	 




	 




	 






	3.




	Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
	presented in this report;






	 




	 




	 






	4.




	I
	am the only certifying officer responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
	in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
	Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:






	 




	 




	 








	a)




	designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure control and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
	us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;






	 




	 




	 








	b)




	designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
	our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;






	 




	 




	 








	c)




	evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
	on such evaluation; d) disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting
	that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the
	case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting; and






	 




	 




	 






	5.




	I
	have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s
	auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):






	 




	 




	 








	a)




	all
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process summarize and report financial
	information; and b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
	role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
