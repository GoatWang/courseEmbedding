	eXp
	World Holdings, Inc. Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Financial Results






	 






	2016 Agent Growth
	of 178%; Drives Revenue Growth of 137% to Record $54.2 Million





	 




	BELLINGHAM, WA --(Marketwired
	- April 03, 2017) - eXp World Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: EXPI), the holding company for eXp Realty LLC, The Agent-Owned Cloud Brokerage®,
	has provided a corporate update and its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016.




	 





	2016
	Company Highlights





	 





	 


	•

	 



	Revenues

	in 2016 increased 137% to $54.2
	million compared to $22.9 million in 2015.





	 


	•

	 



	Net loss in 2016
	increased to $(26.0) million, or $(0.51) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $(4.6) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share
	in 2015. The net loss in 2016 was primarily due to non-cash charges as a result of a $20.5 million valuation increase of the intrinsic
	value of certain options due to an increase in share price during the period, and a $4.3 million increase in stock compensation
	expense. This compares to a $3.4 million valuation increase of the intrinsic value of certain options and a $1.2 million increase
	in stock compensation expense in 2015.




	 


	•

	 



	Adjusted EBITDA
	(a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 397% to $1.6 million in 2016, compared to $0.3 million in 2015.




	 


	•

	 



	Agents
	and brokers on the eXp Realty platform increased 178% to 2,401 in 2016, compared to 864 at the end of 2015. On March 15, 2017,
	the number of agents and brokers surpassed 3,000.





	 





	Management Commentary





	 




	"2016
	established us as one of the largest and fastest growing brokerages in North America as we nearly tripled in size over the
	past year," said Glenn Sanford, Founder, CEO and Chairman of eXp World Holdings, Inc. "Our strong revenue and
	adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016 showcases the leverage in our model, which we expect to continue to be evident as we execute
	on our overall strategy.




	 




	"Driving
	this is our cloud-based brokerage model, which creates a strong value proposition for agents and has allowed us to attract some
	of the top producers, as well as some of the highest ranking teams, throughout the U.S. and Canada. We have become a leading brokerage
	of choice for agents due to eXp Realty's unique value proposition.




	 




	"Throughout
	2016 and into 2017, we have continued to focus on investing in the infrastructure and tools necessary to support our growth and
	ensure scalability of eXp's Realty's business model. The investments we are making today will allow us to support a much larger,
	more mature organization well into the future. We expect our robust growth to continue to increase both in terms of agent count
	and revenues, along with our value proposition to our agent-owners and shareholders."




	 





	Fourth Quarter
	2016 Financial Results





	 




	Revenues increased
	181% to a record $18.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Sequentially,
	revenues increased 14% when compared to revenue of $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2016. This growth is a direct result
	of the increased agent count and corresponding higher revenues realized by the Company's real estate brokerage division, eXp Realty.




	 




	In the fourth quarter
	of 2016, eXp Realty added 585 agents and brokers to its platform, an increase of 309% when compared to 143 agents and brokers
	added in the fourth quarter of 2015. This represents a sequential increase of 32% when compared to 418 agents added in the third
	quarter of 2016. eXp Realty ended 2016 with 2,401 real estate professionals on its platform across 42 states, the District of
	Columbia and Alberta, Canada. On March 15, 2017, eXp Realty surpassed the 3,000 agent milestone on its platform.




	 




	During the fourth
	quarter of 2016, operating loss was $4.7 million, compared to a $1.0 million operating loss in the same quarter of 2015. The increase
	in operating loss was primarily due to a significant increase in non-cash stock compensation expense of $3.7 million, and an increase
	in non-cash stock option expense of $0.04 million, due to an increase in share price during the period.

	Adjusted EBITDA
	(a non-GAAP financial measure) in the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $94,000, compared to $40,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.




	 




	Net loss for the
	three months ended December 31, 2016 was $4.6 million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $7.1 million, or
	$(0.14) per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increased net loss was primarily attributed to the significant
	increase in aforementioned non-cash stock option and stock compensation expenses.




	 





	Full Year 2016
	Financial Results





	 




	eXp World
	Holdings reported revenue of $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 137% compared to the prior year.
	This increase was mainly attributable to the 178% growth of the agent base during 2016, as eXp Realty grew from 864 to 2,401 agents.




	 




	In 2016,
	eXp Realty added 1,537 agents and brokers to its platform, an increase of 287% when compared to the 397 agents and brokers added
	in 2015. eXp Realty had 2,401 brokers and agents on its platform on December 31, 2016.




	 




	Operating loss for
	the full year 2016 was $26.0 million, an increase from $4.5 million in the same period in 2015. The increase in operating loss
	was primarily due to a significant increase in non-cash stock option expense of $20.5 million due to an increase in share price
	during the period, as well as a significant increase in non-cash stock compensation expense of $4.3 million as a result of agents
	joining the eXp Realty platform.




	 




	Adjusted EBITDA
	in 2016 increased 397% to $1.6 million, compared to $0.3 million in 2015.




	 




	Net loss
	in 2016 was $(26.0) million, or $(0.51) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $(4.6) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share
	in 2015. The increased net loss was primarily attributed to the aforementioned significant increase in non-cash stock option and
	stock compensation expenses.




	 




	Cash and cash equivalents
	as of December 31, 2016 were $1.7 million compared with $0.6 million as of December 31, 2015. Net operating cash flow for the
	year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.0 million, an increase of 195% from the last year.

	Use of Non-GAAP Financial
	Measures





	 




	To provide investors
	with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP
	financial measure. We view Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure and, as such, we believe that the GAAP financial
	measure most directly comparable to it is net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding interest, income
	taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock based compensation. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides us an important measure
	of operating performance, primarily from a cash flow standpoint, and enhances comparability while providing investors with useful
	insight into the underlying trends of the business. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and this
	measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, as the
	excluded items may have significant effects on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, our measure of Adjusted
	EBITDA may differ from other companies' measure of Adjusted EBITDA. When evaluating our performance, Adjusted EBITDA should be
	considered with other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income and other GAAP results.
	In the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors and others more meaningfully
	evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations.




	 





	Safe Harbor Statement





	 




	The statements contained
	herein may include statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements that are based on management's current
	views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events
	to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the
	date hereof, and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update them. These statements include, but are not limited
	to, statements about the Company's expansion, revenue growth, operating results, financial performance and net income changes.
	Such statements are not guarantees of future performance. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially
	and adversely from those expressed in forward-looking statements include changes in business or other market conditions; the difficulty
	of keeping expense growth at modest levels while increasing revenues; and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's
	Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EXPI Driving Market Growth with Product, Process and People   Every company’s success is determined by product, process and people. With unique product offerings in the real estate industry, eXp World Holdings (OTCQB: EXPI) has demonstrated both the need and the desire for its services. Revenue growth of 112% in the last year, and 178% agent expansion during the same period, is a testament to successful product acceptance and use. Process, the efficient execution and delivery of the company’s products and services, is also proven by the numbers. The third and, perhaps, most significant aspect of a successful company is people, most importantly, management.   Management sets the course and culture of a company and is responsible for both product and process. The management team at eXp World Holdings has the background, vision, and expertise to execute the company’s plan efficiently and effectively.   CEO and Chairman of the Board Glenn Sanford accumulated executive level experience with a number of technology-related companies prior to founding eXp World Holdings. About 20 years ago, he founded and led a successful online e-commerce and logistics company, where attention to product and process are paramount. Sanford became active in online real estate in 2002, and, from 2004 to 2007, he led a large team of realtors while specializing in online client acquisition, client conversion and technology. When the real estate boom went bust, Sanford responded by forming eXp Realty in 2009 as the first truly cloud-based national real estate brokerage. His vision, experience, and tenacity still guide the company’s success today.   Sanford has surrounded himself with creative, high caliber executive leadership. Russ Cofano, president and general counsel, has an extensive background in real estate and real estate law, and he has worked at executive levels in nearly every segment of the real estate industry. Cofano is a published and recognized author, public speaker, and a sought-after consultant in real estate matters.   The additions of Jason Gesing, CEO of the Real Estate Division and Board Member, and Vikki Bartholomae, president of the Real Estate Division, dramatically impacted the upsurge in growth of eXp World Holdings. Both senior veterans of the real estate industry, Gesing and Bartholomae bring experienced success to the management team.   Sanford chose an experienced and dedicated CFO in Alan Goldman. Goldman consulted for eXp for three years prior to joining the eXp team. He has extensive experience in public company accounting standards and financial reporting, along with multiple other financial and back office skills.   The board of directors is seasoned, experienced, and well respected, both in the real estate community and beyond. Drawing from varied industries and backgrounds helps keep eXp focused and provides infrastructure for fast paced growth.   With product, process, and exceptional people in place, it’s no wonder that eXp World Holdings has enjoyed such phenomenal growth in recent months.

eXp World Holdings, Inc. (EXPI) Driving Market Growth with Product, Process and People

February 28, 2017 Christopher 



Every company’s success is determined by product, process and people. With unique product offerings in the real estate industry, eXp World Holdings (OTCQB: EXPI) has demonstrated both the need and the desire for its services.  Revenue growth of 112% in the last year, and 178% agent expansion during the same period, is a testament to successful product acceptance and use. Process, the efficient execution and delivery of the company’s products and services, is also proven by the numbers. The third and, perhaps, most significant aspect of a successful company is people, most importantly, management.
Management sets the course and culture of a company and is responsible for both product and process. The management team at eXp World Holdings has the background, vision, and expertise to execute the company’s plan efficiently and effectively.
CEO and Chairman of the Board Glenn Sanford accumulated executive level experience with a number of technology-related companies prior to founding eXp World Holdings. About 20 years ago, he founded and led a successful online e-commerce and logistics company, where attention to product and process are paramount. Sanford became active in online real estate in 2002, and, from 2004 to 2007, he led a large team of realtors while specializing in online client acquisition, client conversion and technology. When the real estate boom went bust, Sanford responded by forming eXp Realty in 2009 as the first truly cloud-based national real estate brokerage. His vision, experience, and tenacity still guide the company’s success today.
Sanford has surrounded himself with creative, high caliber executive leadership. Russ Cofano, president and general counsel, has an extensive background in real estate and real estate law, and he has worked at executive levels in nearly every segment of the real estate industry. Cofano is a published and recognized author, public speaker, and a sought-after consultant in real estate matters.
The additions of Jason Gesing, CEO of the Real Estate Division and Board Member, and Vikki Bartholomae, president of the Real Estate Division, dramatically impacted the upsurge in growth of eXp World Holdings. Both senior veterans of the real estate industry, Gesing and Bartholomae bring experienced success to the management team.
Sanford chose an experienced and dedicated CFO in Alan Goldman. Goldman consulted for eXp for three years prior to joining the eXp team. He has extensive experience in public company accounting standards and financial reporting, along with multiple other financial and back office skills.
The board of directors is seasoned, experienced, and well respected, both in the real estate community and beyond. Drawing from varied industries and backgrounds helps keep eXp focused and provides infrastructure for fast paced growth.
With product, process, and exceptional people in place, it’s no wonder that eXp World Holdings has enjoyed such phenomenal growth in recent months.

ProBility Media Corp.’s (PBYA) E-Learning Brand Is Transforming Businesses

July 27, 2017 Christopher 




July acquisition of W Marketing further expanded the ProBility educational brand into the U.S. electrical industry, a $130 billion market
Products include virtual reality products for 3D animation and modeling training, thanks to a 51 percent ownership stake in ProBility Immersive Technologies
ProBility Safety Academy now offers courses in private security, public safety, criminal justice and police science

An EdTech company serving numerous career-intensive fields, ProBility Media Corp. (OTCQB: PBYA) is offering businesses full-service training and career advancement resources. Small- and medium-sized businesses in these areas have traditionally had to rely on disparate e-learning resources. Now, ProBility is offering high quality materials that are consistent with those accessible by enterprise-level organizations. The company has recently expanded into many fields, serving businesses of all sizes in multiple industries with materials for training and career advancement.
ProBility closed an acquisition of W Marketing, Inc. in July 2017, expanding its reach into the electrical industry, valued at roughly $130 billion in the U.S. The resources available now include educational courses and exam preparation materials that are compliant with all relevant standards. They can potentially be used by the tens of thousands of electrical contractors in the country and by hundreds of thousands of electrical workers who install, maintain, and repair lighting, power, and communications systems.
The company’s educational products extend all the way into the virtual reality realm. In a strategic joint venture with Industrial3D Corp., ProBility Immersive Technologies was formed to create content focused on the virtual reality and interactive media content trades. Initially, the company added a library with over 200 industry-specific intellectual property animations. It also offers subscription services to energy and industrial sector employers.
Another recent addition to the company’s brand is ProBility Safety Academy. It is a complete online security and safety training institution spanning many fields, from private security to public safety, police science and criminal justice. Books, course content, and practice tests are open to students and professionals in any part of the safety and security industry. A joint venture with Ranger Guard and Investigations, the academy is accredited in the state of Texas.
ProBility isn’t just focusing on expanding its e-learning reach into various industries. Its recent letter of intent to purchase Cranbury International, which exports educational/reference materials to South and Central America and Caribbean nations, is evidence that the company is looking to expand internationally. A future acquisition, expected to close within 30 days (http://dtn.fm/F4cWk), could give ProBility access to private sector and government markets in Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, and other regions. Cranbury represents about 40 major publishers.
The company serves skilled trades through numerous divisions, including Brown Technical Publications Inc.; Brown Technical Media Corp.; Brown Book Shop, Inc.; One Exam Prep, LLC; and National Electrical Wholesale Providers. ProBility Safety Academy is one of these divisions as well. The available e-learning products for career training and advancement and compliance span over 60 trades, and the company continues to work toward expanding its scope.

ChineseInvestors.com (CIIX) Takes Aim at North American, Chinese Cannabidiol Markets

July 27, 2017 Christopher 




CIIX’s multi-prong approach offers opportunity for investors
Company to launch hemp-infused skin care product line in China
Brick-and-mortar store planned for California, CBD biotech incorporated in Canada
Online CBD store serves global Chinese-speaking population; Yelp style app helps Chinese-speakers find U.S. medical marijuana dispensaries

ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) is offering a unique opportunity for investors as the company pursues a multi-pronged approach to conquering the rapidly expanding global markets in cannabidiol products and the medical marijuana space in Canada. The company aims to be the world’s leading publicly traded Chinese nutritional company.
Globally, ChineseInvestors.com targets the global Chinese-speaking population with an online CBD store offering hemp-based products. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that research is showing has numerous health benefits including the treatment of epilepsy. Many other CBD health benefits are being discovered, and the market is rapidly expanding.
The company announced earlier this week (http://dtn.fm/Br7Xj) that its subsidiary, CBD Biotechnology Co. Ltd., has officially filed a record of its first line of non-industrial hemp-infused skin care products with the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). The product line is expected to launch in late August or early September and will position CBD Biotechnology as a first-mover in China’s CBD-based skin care market.
Another part of the company’s strategic plan to penetrate the Chinese-speaking market is the launch of a ‘Yelp’ style mobile app to help users locate dispensaries and discuss cannabis products in the U.S., along with a CBD retail store in the predominantly Chinese community of San Gabriel, California, where the company’s headquarters are located.
Other exciting developments from ChineseInvestors.com include the announcement of a bitcoin payment solution for its wholly-owned subsidiary, ChineseHempOil.com, Inc., and the company’s effort to become the first company in China to employ CBD oil as a treatment to relieve suffering for epilepsy and Alzheimer’s patients. The company plans to continue studying CBD oil’s efficacy as a treatment for these diseases and invest in CBD drug R&D enterprises, with an end goal of developing a variety of CBD drugs to treat epilepsy and Alzheimer’s.
Marijuana use is illegal in China, but cannabis-based oils, including hemp-based CBD, are legal, giving CIIX access to a market of almost two billion potential customers.

Algae Dynamics Corp.’s (ADYNF) Therapeutic Fortified Formulas Likely to Boost Endocannabinoid System

July 26, 2017 Christopher 




Commercializing proprietary BioSilo® algae cultivation system
Developing therapies that combine omega-3s and cannabinoids
Poised to enter billion dollar markets

If you think you haven’t had cannabinoids because you’ve never used cannabis, you are completely mistaken. You may not have ‘touched’ plant-derived cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids), but it would have been biologically impossible to escape the ones produced by your body (endocannabinoids). Endocannabinoids play an essential mediating role in a number of human physiologic systems. They promote a Goldilocks internal environment, a mean between excess and deficiency in a variety of functions and areas, and recent scholarship has shown that their production is enhanced and fostered by fatty acids, the kind used by Algae Dynamics Corp. (OTCQB: ADYNF). As a result, ADYNF has begun to develop fortified formulas of omega-3s and cannabis oil that may boost the functioning of the human endocannabinoid system.
Discovery of what is now known as the endocannabinoid system has a peculiar history. It is perhaps the only known human physiologic system that is named after a plant, and that’s all because of chronology. A number of substances isolated from the cannabis plant were later found to be produced by the human body. First identification and isolation of the two major cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), is attributed to Raphael Mechoulam and his colleague Y. Gaoni in Israel in 1964. Mechoulam, whose discovery and further research into cannabis has earned him the moniker, ‘Father of Cannabis’, was also part of a team that, in 1992, discovered the endocannabinoid system.
This physiologic system plays a vital role in maintaining human health. Endocannabinoids and their receptors permeate the human body. They can be found in the brain, in various organs, in connective tissue, in glands and in immune cells. Their main function appears to be stabilizing our internal environment, freeing it from the dangerous volatility of the external world. Currently, the two best understood endocannabinoids are anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), studies of which have uncovered a number of medical benefits they may have. Anandamide, for example, inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells and appears to retard the memory decline associated with Alzheimer’s disease. These encouraging findings suggest that phytocannabinoids offer a ‘natural’ way to treat a variety of ailments, including multiple sclerosis (MS), arthritis, hypertension, memory loss, pediatric epilepsy and neuropathic pain.
Research into cannabis and development of therapeutic products goes on. In Canada, as legalization looms, industry professionals are divided on whether there should be a legal distinction between medical and recreational cannabis. A recent article on CBC News Health reports comments by two researchers, who believe that medicinal and recreational cannabis should be separate (http://dtn.fm/aX2Di). They argue that a dual-stream approach would decrease the stigma associated with cannabis use for medicinal purposes, since, for example, it would be sold at a pharmacy rather than a general retailer. Dual-stream would also protect ‘the supply of strains of medical cannabis that have desirable effects for patients, such as lower THC strains sometimes used to treat children who suffer from seizures’ and also increase clinical research into the therapeutic benefits of cannabis.
The products under development by Algae Dynamics promise to pack a powerful therapeutic punch, combining the virtues of omega-3s and cannabinoids. Algae Dynamics’ algae oil is high in omega-3s DHA/DPA, which is in demand by the growing multi-billion dollar food and beverage and health care sectors. The North American omega-3 market was estimated to be $4.0 billion in 2013 and is expected to reach $5.9 billion by 2019, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2014 to 2019. Supplements are the largest application segment driving North America’s omega-3 market, and the cannabinoid market is just as vibrant. It is expected to cross $2 billion in consumer sales by 2020. It seems no matter which market Algae Dynamics chooses for its products, success is almost guaranteed.

Net Element, Inc. (NASDAQ: NETE) stands to benefit from a near cashless society as its North American Unified Payments group processes digital payments and drives sales for the company. A 2017 IPSOS survey for ING found that 54% of 12,585 respondents surveyed do not use cash in a restaurant. Instead, they pay by non-cash methods.
Net Element is a high technology financial group which digitally processes transactions in what is becoming a cashless society. It processes payments from both mobile devices and point-of-sale terminals. Leading the company is the North American Transaction Group. A Zack’s Research Report (http://dtn.fm/9Uwp1) projects that the company’s revenues will reach $63 million in 2017 and $74.6 million in 2018, respectively. Net Element’s North American Transaction Group generated 78% of total Net Element sales in 2016 and jumped 40% in 1Q2017.
The fifth annual ING International Survey of Mobile Banking, published in April 2017 on ING’s website eZonomics (http://dtn.fm/Ag8W1), found that 78% of those surveyed say they expect to keep using less and less cash in the future, and, good news for Net Element, only 34% of U.S. consumers say they generally carry cash. Another 38% of Americans surveyed by IPSOS would prefer to go completely cashless. A key factor in this trend is convenience, the survey said.
While 75% of U.S. consumers said they will never go completely cashless, the amount of purchases has a direct impact on whether global diners use cash or not. For instance, only 25% pay non-cash for a lunch/coffee/snack — yet, 54% go non-cash in a pricier restaurant setting.
“This year’s results tally with our mobile banking surveys in 2016, 2015 and 2014 which also found people are reducing reliance on physical cash. Increasingly they’re transacting via non-cash methods, including mobile payment apps. In fact a fraction of the population appears to have largely dispensed with cash,” the survey said. It added that many have indicated they are comfortable with new ways of paying.
The Zack’s Micro-Cap report said, “Net Element is a growth company in the payment industry that should benefit from the adoption of mobile and online payments in the US, Russia and the Middle East and ultimately globally.”

American Energy Partners, Inc. (XFUL) – Who Says Oil and Water Don’t Mix?

July 26, 2017 Christopher 




Fracking now accounts for half of oil production, and 90 percent of new wells are fracked
Water remains a limited resource, yet is vital to fracking process
American Energy Partners’ vertically-integrated subsidiaries deliver solutions

No matter what the future may hold, for now, the world runs on oil. Oil is the life blood of the world’s economic development, and obtaining oil has been an ongoing quest since long before the invention of the internal combustion engine. The first successful oil well in the U.S. was drilled near Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859. From there, drilling moved rapidly across the entire country, and an oil boom ensued. U.S. crude oil production peaked in 1970 at 9.64 million barrels daily, but production waned after that until the advent of advanced horizontal drilling techniques and hydraulic fracking.
Hydraulic fracking is a sophisticated drilling technology that has exponentially expanded petroleum and natural gas production in the United States. Fracking now accounts for over half of U.S. oil production and two-thirds of natural gas production in the country, making the U.S. the largest natural gas producer in the world. However, large use of water in the fracking process creates controversy. Water is vital to the hydraulic fracking process, and competition for water is fierce.
In an interesting historical twist, Converde Energy USA, Inc. (OTC: XFUL), d/b/a American Energy Partners, Inc., and its subsidiaries are providing solutions in the same area where some the country’s first oil wells were drilled. The company’s sweet spot is where energy production and water meet technology. XFUL’s subsidiaries target energy operations to design, build and operate regional water treatment facilities that serve both the industrial and energy sectors. Together, American Energy Partners and its subsidiaries comprise an integrated vertical that sources, scrubs, and supplies water to mining, oil and gas, power, and other industrial concerns.
The company’s Hydration Corporation of PA (HCPA) subsidiary possesses the technical know-how to source, implement and distribute reclaimed water at a profit. HCPA’s patent-pending process delivers among the highest energy yields possible from a wide range of water-bearing assets and does so with one of the lowest capital expenditures of any other known water process.
XFUL’s American Energy Solutions subsidiary provides off-the-shelf and custom-designed treatment technologies across its customer base and augments HCPA’s low-cost treatment and distribution solutions, while the company’s Gilbert Oil & Gas Company subsidiary is its oil and gas business arm that leverages relationships and experience to source drilling, operating, and partnership opportunities in the oil and gas space. Gilbert Oil & Gas is positioned to not only become a strong customer of the other subsidiaries but also to attract other customers and open new markets.
With almost 90% of all new U.S. onshore oil and gas hydraulically fractured, demand for XFUL’s integrated oil and water services could surge. Who says oil and water don’t mix?

Lexaria Bioscience’s (CSE: LXX) (OTCQB: LXRP) Patented Cannabinoid Delivery System Approved

July 25, 2017 Christopher 




Patented lipophilic delivery system increases bio-absorption
Patents cover broad range of lipophilic bio-actives, including cannabinoids, vitamins, other pharma
19 patents filed across 44 countries
First international patent issued and approved in Australia

Any argument over the efficacy of medicinal marijuana is settled science. Recent prestigious clinical studies have provided conclusive evidence that medical cannabinoids are effective medicine for a variety of diseases and ailments (http://dtn.fm/C9Sao).  However, the human gastrointestinal tract just doesn’t absorb cannabinoids effectively, and much of what is ingested is simply excreted by the body. Subsequently, onset times and effectiveness vary wildly.
Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (CSE: LXX) (OTCQB: LXRP) has patented and licenses a novel delivery system which infuses organically sourced hemp oil into the molecules of other substances. The system utilizes lipids, which form the basis of the human endocannabinoid system, increasing both absorption and bioavailability of payload molecules. Lexaria’s lipophilic enhancement technology increases the bio-absorption of cannabinoid edibles by five to 10 times, to roughly equal that of inhalation. The onset times for effectiveness are also reduced by about 75 percent due to rapid bio-absorption by bypassing first-pass liver metabolism. Not only does Lexaria’s methodology dramatically increase effectiveness; it also masks the taste of cannabinoids and eliminates the need for sugar additives.
Lexaria currently has 19 patent applications filed in the U.S. and internationally covering 44 countries.  The patents encompass a broad range of lipophilic bio-actives including NSAIDs and Nicotine, as well as food/carrier that can be formulated and delivered using Lexaria’s technology. With U.S. patents already issued, the company announced just last week that its first international patent was accepted and issued in Australia (http://dtn.fm/zjN9O). This development opens the door for Lexaria to bring the Australian cannabinoid edibles market under its umbrella.
Chris Bunka, CEO of Lexaria, stated in the news release. “We are very pleased to have received this patent which effectively covers all cannabis oil extract formulated edibles utilizing our technology in Australia…(the) patent award allows us to confidently enter the recently legalized Australian cannabis marketplace where we will seek additional licensing and product distribution partnering opportunities.”
Lexaria employs a low-cost, high-margin license and royalty model of revenue generation. By out-licensing to third party partners, the company keeps five to 10 percent of each partner’s gross sales. With multiple royalty agreements already in the works, the company will continue to expand its licensing network as it receives patent approvals. Interestingly, Lexaria’s novel technology has implications across a wide swath of consumer and pharmaceutical delivery protocols. The global impact of Lexaria’s patents and business model will easily reverberate to the bottom line and has only just begun.

SinglePoint (SING) Sees Advantages in Bitcoin, Formation of SingleSeed.com, and Joint Venture with First Bitcoin Capital Corp.

July 25, 2017 Christopher 




Company sees four to five more acquisitions in pipeline after its investment in California firms DIGS and Convectium
Hired a blockchain expert as part of project addressing payment processes for the cannabis industry
Hired Turner, Stone & Company LLC to complete 2016 financial audit

Wil Ralston, president of SinglePoint, Inc., (OTC: SING), and Greg Lambrecht, CEO, say their company is primed to make four to five more acquisitions as it sees further opportunity in the cannabis market and medical marijuana. It is supporting dispensaries with the cryptocurrency bitcoin and is helping legal sellers solidify an online presence with subsidiary SingleSeed.com. SinglePoint has hired a digital technology blockchain expert and will launch a project to determine a solution for payment processes within the cannabis industry.
The company’s recent online audio press release (http://dtn.fm/4lNeO) illustrates how this Seattle-based full service mobile technology provider is transitioning into a diversified holding company. It is committed to growing in the cannabis industry. It has formed a joint venture with First Bitcoin Capital Corp. (http://dtn.fm/xNi0e) to offer a payments solution using blockchain technology. The goal is to develop a proprietary solution for high-risk vertical businesses within the cannabis industry. Vancouver, Canada-based First Bitcoin Capital (OTC: BITCF) is a vertically-integrated, publicly traded bitcoin entity.
In May 2017, SinglePoint acquired 90% of discount indoor garden supply firm DIGS. That purchase put SinglePoint further into the online marketplace. That company has two brick-and-mortar store locations in California and is eyeing a third. It also has an online store, www.DIGSHydro.com. SinglePoint has also acquired a portion of Convectium (http://dtn.fm/9Bk7M). This California company creates infrastructure for firms in the cannabis market. It has developed a unique oil filling system, and its products will be sold through SinglePoint’s SingleSeed.com subsidiary.
CEO Lambrecht said SinglePoint is focused on organic growth and acquisition. He is optimistic about legislation coming from the new administration and, eventually, banks opening up to the cannabis industry. “Singlepoint is basically a mobile payments technology company, but we’re able to really jump into any vertical because almost every business has a payment option,” Lambrecht said in the release.
Lambrecht, also president, CEO and founder of SingleSeed, added that SingleSeed.com can enable cannabis retailers to process sales using bitcoin and help dispensaries use online marketing strategies such as texting and mobile phone sales. He explains how the company’s cashless ATMs on site can offer dispensaries the ease of accepting a cashless transaction with bitcoin for a cannabis or medical marijuana purchase. Revenue streams for SinglePoint are created through a transaction commission.
SinglePoint is positioned to benefit from the growth of the cannabis industry. Additionally, Lambrecht disclosed that Turner, Stone & Company, LLP, has been hired to complete an audit of SinglePoint’s financials for 2016.

Moxian, Inc. (NASDAQ: MOXC) Taking Aim at a Spectacular Trend that’s Transforming the World’s Second-Largest Economy

July 25, 2017 Christopher 



China’s economy is the world’s second-largest
Former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia says China is on the cusp of an incredible growth spurt
Moxian contributes to and reaps rewards from China’s growth

China, the world’s second-largest economy, is on the cusp of an incredible growth spurt, says Stephen Roach, the former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia (http://dtn.fm/Y5iCU). In a recent CNBC interview, Roach stated, “The Chinese economy seems to be making remarkable progress in transforming itself into more of a consumer-based model… The wave of innovation in their private-based economy, anything from e-commerce to medical sciences, is really quite spectacular… [China’s] e-commerce share of total consumption is more than double ours [U.S.], and that gap is rising.”
Helping trigger this spectacular transformation and bridging e-commerce to brick and mortar retail is Moxian, Inc. (NASDAQ: MOXC). Moxian’s creative and socially interactive online platforms and mobile applications are moving the burgeoning Chinese consumer from online views to retail purchases at Moxian’s brick and mortar client locations. Moxian’s seductive social network integrates social media and business into a single platform that offers products, features and services that appeal to consumers, keeps them engaged and refers new customers.
The company’s ingenious and captivating online platforms and mobile applications, the Moxian+ User app and the Moxian+ Business app, allow businesses to interface with both new and existing customers. These online interactions provide each business the data to analyze consumer likes, dislikes and trends. Moxian’s platforms offer businesses the ability to create, manage and promote individualized customer loyalty programs, targeted advertising campaigns and special promotions. These interactions between users and Moxian’s merchant clients drive retail traffic into the brick and mortar locations and gives merchant clients the ability to study consumer behavior and custom tailor offerings to consumers.
Impressive by almost any standard, China’s GDP growth has hovered around seven percent the last several years. However, if, as the former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia predicts, a consumer driven “spectacular transformation” is under way in the Chinese economy, then China could easily see ten, 12, even 14 percent GDP growth as it did early this century. With the remarkable niche it has carved out, Moxian will no doubt contribute to and reap the rewards from this spectacular transformation.

Global Payout, Inc. (GOHE) is Making Worldwide Financial Transactions Seamless

July 24, 2017 Christopher 



Connecting a global financial market to a private banking network
A cloud-based financial platform for trading & settlement of depositary accounts
Using blockchain technology to deliver secure financial transactions

Banking has come a long way from the time when moneychangers set up their tables in the marketplace. The technology then was minimal: paper records of bills of exchange and letters of credit. Today, technology dominates banking. More than a quarter (about 9,000) of Goldman Sachs’ 33,000 full-time employees are engineers and programmers, by one account (http://dtn.fm/dX51Z). Its CEO is on record as saying that Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) is a technology firm, a pointed indication of the extent to which information technologies have permeated modern banking. To serve this growing fintech market, California-based Global Payout, Inc. (OTC: GOHE) is rapidly developing a variety of innovative products. The company is offering state-of-the-art software solutions to fintech companies involved in processing money remittances, wire transfers, bill payments, business-to-business (B2B) payments, currency exchange, eWallet payments and other types of financial transactions.
Since its inception in 2009, Global Payout, Inc. has been a leading provider of comprehensive and customized prepaid payment solutions for domestic and international organizations distributing money worldwide. The company was founded by Jim Hancock, who has guided its evolution from a program management and consulting services company offering prepaid debit cards and electronic wallet products to the global, full-service payment platform it is today. Hancock is Global Payout’s current CEO and chairman. His 30 years of experience range over a variety of industries and include senior positions in investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, payment processing and telecommunications. For the last 14 years, he has successfully managed close to 40 custom-designed prepaid debit card programs. Hancock intends to leverage his vast array of contacts and in-depth knowledge of the payment industry in executing Global Payout’s new initiatives.
These began in 2014, when the company introduced its first online payment platform, called the Consolidated Payment Gateway (CPG). CPG allows its enterprise clients the capability to transfer money to international bank accounts, mobile accounts, and prepaid card accounts. The development of the CPG became the foundation for the introduction of the company’s present, state-of-the-art fintech payment system in 2016, which both expands the range of financial services available to clients and offers them reduced transaction costs.
In January 2017, Global Payout announced a licensing agreement with First American Electronic Payment Solutions, Inc., producer of an innovative software system for companies wishing to process money remittances, wire transfers, bill payments, B2B transactions, eWallet payments and transfers, currency exchanges and other types of financial transactions. This collaboration provides the backbone infrastructure that supports the company’s recently introduced Global Reserve Platform (GRP), a customizable, “banking-in-a-box” web-based platform. GRP offers the capability to execute the front-to-back office processing requirements of domestic/foreign exchange and international payment service providers and is expected to improve work flow, operational efficiencies, and global financial management for enterprises operating across the globe.
Global Payout is connecting this worldwide cloud-based financial services platform to traditional banking. The company holds majority control of ISBC Holdings, Ltd., the sole domestic and international management company for the International Sovereign Banking Corporation (ISBC). ISBC is a privately-owned sovereign nation bank to be held on the sovereign tribal land of the Wakpamni Lake Community, Oglala Sioux Tribe located at the Pine Ridge Tribal Reservation in South Dakota.
With such a spectrum of services, Global Payout can offer traditional banking and products to businesses that cannot access those services. For example, last year, the company announced that Marijuana Company of America (OTC: MCOA) had selected Global Payout as its financial solutions provider (http://dtn.fm/bM1ZE). Global Payout’s CPG and MoneyTrac prepaid solutions will enable MCOA to process membership fees and pay vendors, employees, and affiliates. MCOA members will be able to make purchases using an MCOA-branded prepaid card, reducing cash transactions and enabling online and mobile purchases. This significantly reduces the risk associated with operating a cash-only cannabis business and the legal perils associated with the substance.

MoneyOnMobile (MOMT) Digital Mobile Payment Network Services World’s Largest Under-Banked Population

July 24, 2017 Christopher 



India has world’s second-largest population at 1.35 billion
India is largest under-banked population in the world
MoneyOnMobile services under-banked with digital mobile payment network
39 percent monthly compounded revenue growth in Q1

With an average growth rate of around seven percent over the last two decades, India’s economy is the sixth-largest in the world measured by GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power. In spite of its economic prowess, the Indian consumer market is the largest under-banked population in the world. Banking services are scarce and woefully inadequate, forcing cash transactions and chocking consumer purchasing power. A prime example of scarce banking services is India’s paltry 200,000 ATMs servicing its 1.35 billion citizens. India would need two million more ATMs in order to have the same ratio of ATMs to people as in the U.S.
Since 2010, MoneyOnMobile, Inc. (OTCQX: MOMT) has been delivering needed services to India’s vast un-banked and under-banked population. MoneyOnMobile is a digital mobile phone payment network that allows consumers to deposit cash with one of its 335,000 retailers in 700+ cities. MoneyOnMobile is authorized by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up this semi-closed payment network, which enables registered users to buy goods, products and services from registered merchants.
The consumers’ cash deposits become digital currency in MoneyOnMobile’s computerized records. Consumers then have the ability to perform over 55 different transactions, including various bill payments, cash withdrawal, domestic remittances and money transfer using only their mobile phone and SMS text messaging. The system is faster, safer, more reliable, cheaper and much easier to use than transacting in all cash.
MoneyOnMobile is being embraced by the Indian un-banked and under-banked consumer, and the company’s reach into the remotest parts of India makes it the go-to prepaid instrument on the market today. The company has already served over 198 million cumulative unique mobile phone number users and has processed $1.8 billion worth of transactions. Convinced it’s just getting traction, MoneyOnMobile had 39 percent monthly compounded revenue growth in the three months from January to May 2017.
MoneyOnMobile’s cellular prepaid digital payment system is directly centered in one of highest spheres of growth in the financial services arena. The company’s no-cost to end-user services meet a vast unmet need in one of the world’s most populated countries, providing users newfound flexibility and self-dependence. It shouldn’t be long before MoneyOnMobile’s growth numbers eclipse the first three months of this year.
