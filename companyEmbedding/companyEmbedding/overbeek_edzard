January 11, 2016
Santa Clara, Calif. - 
Infoblox Inc. (NYSE:BLOX), the network control company, today announced the appointment of technology executive Edzard Overbeek to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. Overbeek, most recently senior vice president of the global services business at Cisco, adds deep expertise to the board in strategic growth areas targeted by Infoblox: security, cloud, and analytics.
“I worked with Edzard at Cisco, so I know from first-hand experience that he brings a unique mix of sales and technology experience to our board,” said Jesper Andersen, president and chief executive officer of Infoblox. “Edzard led Cisco sales teams across EMEAR (Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Russia), Asia Pacific, and Japan, giving him connections that can help Infoblox expand its global sales operations. As leader of the wide-ranging Cisco Services portfolio, he deeply understands the opportunities created by the current transformation of enterprise networking.”
“Infoblox has the talent, foundational technology, and global reach to help organizations build networks that are secure, stable, and ready to meet rapidly evolving business needs,” said Overbeek. “I’m honored to join the board of directors and look forward to helping drive the company’s continuing growth.”
 Overbeek, 48, led Cisco Services from August 2012 to July 2015, where he was responsible for a business group with 15,000 employees and annual sales of $12 billion. He joined Cisco in 2000 as managing director for Cisco Netherlands and then rose through a series of leadership positions including vice president for EMEA channels, vice president for strategic planning in Europe, president of Cisco Japan, and president of the Asia Pacific region.
Prior to Cisco, Overbeek held leadership positions at other technology companies including Fujitsu, Siemens, and Copaco. Before his business career, Overbeek served as an officer in the Royal Dutch Army.

Cisco Systems, Inc.


                  At Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) customers come first and an integral part of our DNA is creating long-lasting customer partnerships and working with them to identify their needs and provide solutions that support their success.

The concept of solutions being driven to address specific customer challenges has been with Cisco since its inception. Husband and wife Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner, both working for Stanford University, wanted to email each other from their respective offices located in different buildings but were unable to due to technological shortcomings. A technology had to be invented to deal with disparate local area protocols; and as a result of solving their challenge - the multi-protocol router was born.

Since then Cisco has shaped the future of the Internet by creating unprecedented value and opportunity for our customers, employees, investors and ecosystem partners and has become the worldwide leader in networking - transforming how people connect, communicate and collaborate.
