                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

	Registration No. 333-165171







	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	We have acted as special counsel to Nissan Auto Receivables Corporation II, a Delaware corporation (the 

	Depositor

	), in connection with the offering of the Class A-1 Notes, the
	Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes (collectively, the 

	Notes

	) described in the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 4, 2011 and the base prospectus dated November 4,
	2011 (collectively, the 

	Preliminary Prospectus

	), which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	Commission

	) pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	

	Act

	). As described in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Notes will be issued by Nissan Auto Receivables 2011-B Owner Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the 

	Issuing Entity

	), formed by the Depositor pursuant to a
	trust agreement between the Depositor and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as owner trustee. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the 

	Indenture

	) between the Issuing Entity and Citibank, N.A., as indenture
	trustee.




	We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the organizational
	documents of the Depositor, Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (

	NMAC

	) and the Issuing Entity, the Preliminary Prospectus, the current draft of the Indenture, the form of Notes included as an exhibit to the Indenture, and such
	other records, documents and certificates of the Depositor, NMAC, the Issuing Entity and public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary for the purpose of this opinion. In addition, we have assumed that the Indenture will be duly
	executed and delivered by the parties thereto; that the Notes will be duly executed and delivered substantially in the forms contemplated by the Indenture; and that the Notes will be sold as described in the above captioned registration statement.

	Page 2




	Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:




	The Notes are in due and proper form and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Issuing Entity and the Indenture Trustee, and the due authorization of the Notes by
	all necessary action on the part of the Issuing Entity, when the Notes have been validly executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the Indenture and delivered against payment therefor, the Notes will be valid and binding obligations of
	the Issuing Entity, enforceable against the Issuing Entity in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally (including,
	without limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws), and general principles of equity, including without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance or
	injunctive relief, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.




	The opinions
	expressed above are limited to the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York (excluding choice of law principles therein) and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We express no opinion herein as
	to the laws of any other jurisdiction and no opinion regarding the statutes, administrative decisions, rules, regulations or requirements of any county, municipality, subdivision or local authority of any jurisdiction.




	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to a Form 8-K filed in connection with the Preliminary
	Prospectus and to the use of our name therein, without admitting that we are experts within the meaning of the Act or the rules or regulations of the Commission thereunder, with respect to any part of the above captioned registration
	statement or the Preliminary Prospectus.

Fitch Affirms 2 Classes from Nissan Auto Receivables 2011-B Owner Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms 2 Classes from Nissan Auto Receivables 2011-B Owner Trust
    





September 16, 2014 12:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms two classes 
      of the Nissan Auto Receivables 2011-B Owner Trust as detailed below:
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The ratings affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the original ratings and make full payments to investors 
      in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transactions. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transactions, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transactions have exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'Nissan Auto Receivables 2011-B Owner Trust 
      - Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the 
      asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, 
      Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance 
      Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.
