Scio Diamond Technology Corporation is a synthetic diamond manufacturer that produces near flawless single-crystal diamonds for gemstone and industrial applications, in Greenville, South Carolina. The company produces chemical vapor deposition (CVD) gem-sized synthetic diamond crystals using processes pioneered by Apollo Diamond, and has acquired Apollo Diamond's technology and assets including several U.S. patents on the processes.[1]

Products[edit]
Scio's so-called "cultured diamonds" are real diamonds, and thus they have the same physical and optical properties as diamonds formed by geological processes. The company's controlled manufacturing processes enables it to produce very high-quality, high-purity, high volume, single-crystal colorless, near colorless and fancy colored diamonds to suit a variety of industrial and gemstone applications.[2]
Synthetic diamonds are often viewed as "green" as they are not mined, avoiding the controversy surrounding blood diamonds by ensuring ethical sourcing that does not finance war or violence.[3]

People pay thousands, and hundreds of thousands of dollars for diamonds. Why? 
Rarity, Scarcity, Brilliance and Beauty
The effort and investment to get just one diamond out of the ground and onto the finger of a happy fiancée is enormous. Each diamond passes through many hands.




It is mined from the ground in an expensive and often dangerous process




The mining company sells the diamond to a gem trader.




The trader transports it to one of the diamond-cutting centers of the world, such as Antwerp, Tel Aviv or Mumbai.




Highly skilled cutters apply their expertise to cut and polish the diamond into an exquisite gem.







The cutter sells the finished diamond to a wholesaler.




The wholesaler markets it to a jewelry maker, who creates an elegant piece of fine jewelry.




The artisan sells the finished jewelry piece to a retailer.




The jewelry store sells the diamond ring to an excited would-be fiancée.








Mined diamonds aren’t forever
 
Since the 1400s, when diamonds were becoming a highly desired fashion accessory for Europe’s aristocrats, the value of these gems has steadily increased. When vast new mines opened during the 19th and 20th centuries, the demand for these precious gems grew.
However, while some of the earliest diamonds were gathered from rivers and streams in India, most of today’s diamonds are mined from deep in the earth. And these sources are drying up.
Consider this:


Most diamond mines are past peak production levels


Deeper, more expensive, more dangerous mining is required to locate the remaining diamonds


Budgets for mine exploration have been reduced and few new mines are expected to open


Mined diamond production has fallen by more than 25% in less than 10 years


Mined diamonds won’t keep pace with demand over the next 30 to 40 years:


70m

Mined diamond production is expected to decrease by more than 70 million carats per year 


300m

Demand for diamonds is expected to grow to 250-300 million carats per year


25m

Only 25 to 50 million carats of mined diamonds are expected to be available







Lab-grown diamonds or mined diamonds for you?
Lab-grown diamonds have the same scintillation, sparkle, gleam and life as mined diamonds and provide an exceptional alternative. Consumers of gems or industrial diamonds can get a larger or higher quality diamond for the same price or identical properties for a lower price.
      For gem consumers, who feel that mined diamonds are inconsistent with their personal values, lab-grown diamonds provide a conflict-free and environmentally friendly replacement to mined diamonds.
      For industrial buyers, who need quality materials with consistency at scale, lab-grown diamonds can provide identical products time after time…unlike mined materials. 
      The consistency that lab-grown diamonds provide to industrial buyers is also very important for jewelry pieces with multiple stones.

How They Grow



How Diamonds Grow








1




Inspect diamond seeds carefully to ensure they are free of inclusions.








2


Take a Peek


Prepare the surface for growth and place diamond seeds on growth platform.








3







Control chamber pressure and temperature.





4






Inject ultra-pure carbon-rich gases and other gases into the chamber.








5






Excite the gases to an energy level where they form a plasma.





6





Let it rain. High-energy carbon precipitates out of a plasma cloud and is deposited on the seeds. The atoms are of sufficient energy that they form the diamond allotrope, rather than the lower energy graphite allotrope.








7




See In Action


Let it grow. Wafer seeds gradually become diamond crystals, building up at a consistent rate until they reach the desired thickness.








8





Open chamber and remove diamond crystals.





9




Slice and shape, using high-energy lasers, for industrial applications.
 See Diamonds for Industry

Cut and polish into gems for jewelry.

About Scio Diamond



About Scio Diamond





Read our Technology Briefing

Scio Diamond creates high quality, single-crystal, lab-grown diamonds in a variety of types and colors, including Type IIa that are finished for fine jewelry, or cores that are sliced and shaped for industrial applications.
      The diamond gemstones we sell to jewelers are certified by renowned gem grading organizations, including the International Gemological Institute (IGI) and the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).
      Scio Diamond produces a large selection of colorless and popular fancy gem colors in pink and yellow. Colorless diamonds are used for jewelry and industrial applications such as optical windows, laser scalpels and electronics. Pink and yellow diamonds are typically used for jewelry. Brown and yellow diamonds are used in many precision milling and grinding industrial applications.
      Scio Diamond conducts significant research and development to advance the science of lab-grown diamonds. The company currently holds 36 U.S and international patents, providing broad intellectual property protections for our manufacturing processes and substantial future opportunities for the utilization of diamond for semiconductors, light emitting diodes and laser applications.
      All of the company’s diamonds are produced in manufacturing facilities in South Carolina.

Diamonds for Jewelry



Diamonds for Jewelry
For centuries, people have celebrated their commitment and love with the gift of a precious diamond. Today, brilliant lab-grown diamonds provide the same beauty, and are a unique and affordable option.


How to buy from Scio Diamond




Elegant fine jewelry

Whether it’s an engagement ring, classic studs, a tennis bracelet, pendant, necklace, bangles or another style of elegant jewelry, lab-grown diamonds are the ideal choice for today’s savvy shopper.
Lab-grown diamonds are chemically, physically and optically identical to mined diamonds. The only difference is that they are produced above the earth in a matter of weeks, rather than grown deep in the earth for centuries.
Scio Diamond produces and sells rough diamond single-crystal cores that can be turned into brilliant gems for jewelry. Our colorless diamonds are Type IIa, the rarest type. And, our gemstones are more economical than mined diamonds, which makes it possible to get a larger or higher clarity stone or save money with an equivalent quality stone.
Our highly controlled laboratory setting for growing diamond is ideal to produce identical stones for fine jewelry. Mined diamonds have subtle differences, making it challenging to find two or more matching stones to place side-by-side in a single jewelry design or in coordinating pieces.




Fancy color diamonds

Lab-grown diamonds are available in the same fancy colors as the most precious mined diamonds. While most people are familiar with colorless diamonds, the very rare fancy color diamonds are the most valuable.
Some pink diamonds, from the only mine in the world producing pinks, cost well over $100,000 per carat. Last year, a 5.5-carat oval-shaped fancy vivid pink diamond sold for $9.6 million … that’s $1.7 million a carat. Scio Diamond sells beautiful lab-grown fancy color pink diamonds at a much more affordable price.





How to buy from Scio Diamond

Please tell us about your interest in Scio Diamond products.




While Scio’s primary focus is on the manufacture and sale of diamond material in rough form, we do on a very limited basis sell finished, ungraded loose gems ready to set in elegant jewelry designs.





Scio Diamond sells diamond as whole crystals, the roughest form, directly out of our growers. This is pure single-crystal diamond surrounded by poly diamond. These are ready to be finished into dazzling gemstones.





We also sell diamond as single-crystal cores, in cubes or round cylinders, with the poly diamond removed by laser. These are ready for cutting and polishing into gems for beautiful jewelry.



I’d like more information on buying diamond from Scio Diamond






Learning the 4 Cs of a diamond


The International Gemological Institute (IGI), Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and the American Gem Society established universal standards on which to evaluate and grade diamonds … the 4 C’s … color, clarity, cut and carat weight. These standards apply to both lab-grown and mined diamonds.




Cut




Clarity




Color




Carat

















Cut


Facets are the flat faces on the gem, and the way they are cut into patterns determines light performance, or brilliance, sparkle and fire. The quality of the cut, whether round brilliant, princess, marquise or another, is established by the final proportions, symmetry and surface finish. 









×




Carat


The weight or size of the diamond is measured in carats. One carat weights 1/5 of a gram. While carat is one indicator of value, some diamonds that weigh the same may not look alike because of how they are cut.






One carat is divided into 100 points



Carat
0.03 carat
0.10 carat
0.20 carat
0.40 carat
1.00 carat
1.50 carat
2.00 carat
2.50 carat


Diameter
2.0 mm
3.0 mm
3.8 mm
4.8 mm
6.5 mm
7.4 mm
8.2 mm
9.0 mm





×




Clarity


The absence of blemishes and inclusions within a gem gives it a higher quality. Flawless gems have no visible inclusions when magnified 10 times. The clarity scale evaluates the number, size, location and nature of blemishes or inclusions. 









×




Color


Diamonds come in many colors. While colorless stones have been considered the most valued over time, fancy color diamonds like pinks and yellows are growing in popularity. Lab-grown pinks are proving to be a great value because of the scarcity of mined pinks.
