If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Strategy and brand consulting[edit]
Hanft founded Hanft Projects in 2010 as a strategic consultancy that develops marketing and communication solutions for consumer brands and business-to-business companies, as well as consulting and venture firms. The firm’s clients have included McKinsey, Microsoft, Conduit, Barnes & Noble,[11] Match.com, Citysearch, Vinfolio, Aviary, borro, City Light Capital and Ribbit Capital.
Advertising career[edit]
Hanft is an award-winning copywriter[12] who started as a comedy writer, working for Garry Marshall.[13] Hanft has worked at Jack Tinker & Partners, and Wells Rich Greene (WRG), where he wrote the "Flick Your Bic" advertising campaign, named one of the 50 best campaigns of all time by Entertainment Weekly.[14][15]
Hanft left WRG in 1980, and started Slater Hanft Martin, which eventually became Hanft Unlimited, Inc.[16] The New York Times described the firm as "A small advertising agency that is every large agency's nightmare."[17]
Hanft's clients have included Sony,[18] Procter & Gamble,[19] Match.com,[19] and Chemistry.com, for which the firm won an Effie for marketing effectiveness in 2008.[20] He also created and orchestrated the $60MM 'It's Okay to Look' campaign for Match.com.[21]
Saddam Hussein[edit]
In 1992, Hanft's agency referenced Saddam Hussein in an advertisement for a client that delivered financial information. The advertisement was headlined "History has shown what happens when one source controls all the information." An Iraqi diplomat protested.[22]
Journalism and cultural criticism[edit]
Hanft writes on a variety of political and cultural subjects for media that include The Daily Beast,[23] Salon,[24] Huffington Post,[25] CNN,[26] Wired,[27] The Atlantic[28] and AOL News.[29] He has also been a frequent commentator on public radio's Marketplace,[30] and has appeared regularly on TV including The Daily Show.[31] For five years he wrote the back-page column "Grist" for Inc. magazine, where he served as a Contributing Editor and Marketer-in-Chief. [32]
Dictionary of the Future[edit]
Published in 2001 and co-written with Faith Popcorn, Dictionary of the Future is described a collection of words and terms that have not yet entered mainstream dictionaries.[33] Wired called the book a "memetic encyclopedia of what's to come, an engaging crash course in bleeding-edge ideas and debatable issues".[34]
Many of the concepts and predictions published in “Dictionary of the Future” went on to become culturally-relevant phenomena, including: free-range children; ego-surfing;[35] Internet sentiment research; infographic design; locouture (local fashion); crowd-sourced new products[36] combat drones; data fasts,[37] and “online learning experts” as a job of the future.

The Casey Anthony Brand Wins






By Adam Hanft






























Cross-Posted from FastCompany.com
Yesterday's surprising verdict was, simply put, a supremely emotional consumer purchase decision. Though a potential death sentence was at stake, the process by which jurors acted as purchasers followed well-established patterns of perception. Jurors listened, drew conclusions and eliminated unpleasant realities that interrupted their existing belief structures in the same way that consumers hear product arguments -- or political arguments -- and toss out the inconvenient, or painful.
To continue the metaphor, the prosecution lost because they acted like product managers, PowerPoint logic in tow. The product manager says, "Buy our widget for all these rational reasons" and the state argued, "Buy our argument for all these rational reasons."
But the defense understood that the case rested on the strength and believability of the Casey Anthony brand -- a brand that the media had been trashing for years before the trial began. Even though she never took the stand, the case rested on whether or not the jury believed she was capable of the horrific murder of which she stood accused. So while the state tried to connect the dots, the defense knew that they had to overcome the viscerally toxic aspects of her behavior by creating an emotional scaffold for jurors to grab onto, a neural framework for re-branding her, for thinking of Casey Anthony in a way that would allow them to resist the prosecution's logical appeals. 
The defense knew that the music mattered as much, if not more than, the words. 
Here are three branding strategies that the defense successfully leveraged:
• Create positive associations that link to deeply seated emotional networks.
The defense showed a lot of footage of Caylee to convince the jury that Casey was a good mother. It worked. Images are depth charges that function on an unconscious level. Those videos branded Casey brilliantly, connecting her with existing, powerful imprints of mothering. After all, bad mothers don't care enough about their children to memorialize every detail of their lives. That footage normalized her, made her relatable.  
The more this footage was shown -- by either side -- the better it was for Casey. And the harder it was for the jury to shut off the neural networks that linked her to the imprint of a loving mother. And, in turn, the easier it was for the jury to accept the defense's arguments -- and to dismiss the hard-partying image the prosecution sought to create.  
It's the Casey Anthony version of Johnnie Cochrane's "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit." If the defendant's behavior doesn't fit what you see of them, you must acquit. Behavioral psychologists call in the confirmation bias.   
• It's a bad time for authority figures. Take advantage of it.
Even though the official syntax is "The People Versus Casey Anthony," jurors can see it as the all-powerful government at war against an individual. And if you read any of the polls, you'll see that Americans are increasingly skeptical of what their government has to say to them, and I believe that translates down to prosecutors -- particularly arrogant ones who laugh and smirk during closing arguments. Because there is such a built-in mistrust of the government, the slightest weakness or flaw in the prosecution's case -- and there was no shortage of them -- becomes magnified.
When Jose Baez, in his summation, said that the government was using "checkbook prosecution" he was tapping into the meme of big, bad government. The government lies and isn't to be trusted in its way -- and Casey Anthony made up imaginary characters and lied in her way. It's a draw.
• It's a good time for accepting the inexplicable.   
Terrorists hijack planes and blow up the World Trade Center. The biggest, and allegedly the smartest banks in America created the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and nearly bankrupted themselves. Black swans -- the highly improbable -- are everywhere. That's the Casey Anthony brand narrative that the defense sold: The truth can co-exist with a defiance of logic.
The absence of any forensic evidence linking Casey Anthony to the murder gave the jury something to hang their existential doubts on; despite the densely patterned wallpaper of lies she told about one imaginary friend after the other, the mother didn't kill the child. The times in which we live created room for the jury to develop a level of comfort with what, outside the courtroom, appeared to be a totally absurd narrative.
There will be no shortage of theories proffered about this case, but unlike the O.J. judgment, where the arguments revolved around color lines, the Casey Anthony decision is more complex.   Beyond the prosecution's tactical mistakes -- and the argument that they should have gone for a lesser charge is a good one -- is the fact that there were two brands fighting for the sale. 
On one side was the brand of motherhood. That's a damn strong brand, even when that motherhood waits a month to report her daughter's disappearance, and feels no compunction about pole dancing and getting a tattoo in this frightening period of uncertainty. 
On the other side was the brand of power and authority, a brand with unlimited resources, a brand that is trusted less and less every day. 
We know the outcome.
Which leads to the question: What kind of brand are you selling?

Strategy and brand consulting[edit]
Hanft founded Hanft Projects in 2010 as a strategic consultancy that develops marketing and communication solutions for consumer brands and business-to-business companies, as well as consulting and venture firms. The firm’s clients have included McKinsey, Microsoft, Conduit, Barnes & Noble,[11] Match.com, Citysearch, Vinfolio, Aviary, borro, City Light Capital and Ribbit Capital.
Advertising career[edit]
Hanft is an award-winning copywriter[12] who started as a comedy writer, working for Garry Marshall.[13] Hanft has worked at Jack Tinker & Partners, and Wells Rich Greene (WRG), where he wrote the "Flick Your Bic" advertising campaign, named one of the 50 best campaigns of all time by Entertainment Weekly.[14][15]
Hanft left WRG in 1980, and started Slater Hanft Martin, which eventually became Hanft Unlimited, Inc.[16] The New York Times described the firm as "A small advertising agency that is every large agency's nightmare."[17]
Hanft's clients have included Sony,[18] Procter & Gamble,[19] Match.com,[19] and Chemistry.com, for which the firm won an Effie for marketing effectiveness in 2008.[20] He also created and orchestrated the $60MM 'It's Okay to Look' campaign for Match.com.[21]
Saddam Hussein[edit]
In 1992, Hanft's agency referenced Saddam Hussein in an advertisement for a client that delivered financial information. The advertisement was headlined "History has shown what happens when one source controls all the information." An Iraqi diplomat protested.[22]
Journalism and cultural criticism[edit]
Hanft writes on a variety of political and cultural subjects for media that include The Daily Beast,[23] Salon,[24] Huffington Post,[25] CNN,[26] Wired,[27] The Atlantic[28] and AOL News.[29] He has also been a frequent commentator on public radio's Marketplace,[30] and has appeared regularly on TV including The Daily Show.[31] For five years he wrote the back-page column "Grist" for Inc. magazine, where he served as a Contributing Editor and Marketer-in-Chief. [32]
Dictionary of the Future[edit]
Published in 2001 and co-written with Faith Popcorn, Dictionary of the Future is described a collection of words and terms that have not yet entered mainstream dictionaries.[33] Wired called the book a "memetic encyclopedia of what's to come, an engaging crash course in bleeding-edge ideas and debatable issues".[34]
Many of the concepts and predictions published in “Dictionary of the Future” went on to become culturally-relevant phenomena, including: free-range children; ego-surfing;[35] Internet sentiment research; infographic design; locouture (local fashion); crowd-sourced new products[36] combat drones; data fasts,[37] and “online learning experts” as a job of the future.

Hanft's clients have included Sony,[18] Procter & Gamble,[19] Match.com,[19] and Chemistry.com, for which the firm won an Effie for marketing effectiveness in 2008.[20] He also created and orchestrated the $60MM 'It's Okay to Look' campaign for Match.com.[21]
Saddam Hussein[edit]
In 1992, Hanft's agency referenced Saddam Hussein in an advertisement for a client that delivered financial information. The advertisement was headlined "History has shown what happens when one source controls all the information." An Iraqi diplomat protested.[22]
Journalism and cultural criticism[edit]
Hanft writes on a variety of political and cultural subjects for media that include The Daily Beast,[23] Salon,[24] Huffington Post,[25] CNN,[26] Wired,[27] The Atlantic[28] and AOL News.[29] He has also been a frequent commentator on public radio's Marketplace,[30] and has appeared regularly on TV including The Daily Show.[31] For five years he wrote the back-page column "Grist" for Inc. magazine, where he served as a Contributing Editor and Marketer-in-Chief. [32]
Dictionary of the Future[edit]
Published in 2001 and co-written with Faith Popcorn, Dictionary of the Future is described a collection of words and terms that have not yet entered mainstream dictionaries.[33] Wired called the book a "memetic encyclopedia of what's to come, an engaging crash course in bleeding-edge ideas and debatable issues".[34]
Many of the concepts and predictions published in “Dictionary of the Future” went on to become culturally-relevant phenomena, including: free-range children; ego-surfing;[35] Internet sentiment research; infographic design; locouture (local fashion); crowd-sourced new products[36] combat drones; data fasts,[37] and “online learning experts” as a job of the future.

Hanft left WRG in 1980, and started Slater Hanft Martin, which eventually became Hanft Unlimited, Inc.[16] The New York Times described the firm as "A small advertising agency that is every large agency's nightmare."[17]
Hanft's clients have included Sony,[18] Procter & Gamble,[19] Match.com,[19] and Chemistry.com, for which the firm won an Effie for marketing effectiveness in 2008.[20] He also created and orchestrated the $60MM 'It's Okay to Look' campaign for Match.com.[21]
Saddam Hussein[edit]
In 1992, Hanft's agency referenced Saddam Hussein in an advertisement for a client that delivered financial information. The advertisement was headlined "History has shown what happens when one source controls all the information." An Iraqi diplomat protested.[22]

Hanft writes on a variety of political and cultural subjects for media that include The Daily Beast,[23] Salon,[24] Huffington Post,[25] CNN,[26] Wired,[27] The Atlantic[28] and AOL News.[29] He has also been a frequent commentator on public radio's Marketplace,[30] and has appeared regularly on TV including The Daily Show.[31] For five years he wrote the back-page column "Grist" for Inc. magazine, where he served as a Contributing Editor and Marketer-in-Chief. [32]
Dictionary of the Future[edit]
Published in 2001 and co-written with Faith Popcorn, Dictionary of the Future is described a collection of words and terms that have not yet entered mainstream dictionaries.[33] Wired called the book a "memetic encyclopedia of what's to come, an engaging crash course in bleeding-edge ideas and debatable issues".[34]
Many of the concepts and predictions published in “Dictionary of the Future” went on to become culturally-relevant phenomena, including: free-range children; ego-surfing;[35] Internet sentiment research; infographic design; locouture (local fashion); crowd-sourced new products[36] combat drones; data fasts,[37] and “online learning experts” as a job of the future.

Adam Hanft, brand strategist

									People Tell Richard Stuff: Episode 12								


							By Richard Anson 

								1 year ago							











This week I’m talking to New York City-based brand guru Adam Hanft.
Adam has consulted for everyone from Microsoft to President Obama, and is a respected writer in his own right, so I picked his brains about brand, disruption, tech and society.









Listen to Richard’s chat with Adam Hanft
A former comedy writer, copywriter, ad-agency boss and now brand strategist through his company Hanft Projects, Adam has an interesting perspective on brands and how they fit in with popular culture. He’s a fascinating guy, full of wisdom and I had a great time talking to him.

Innovation isn’t just for startups





Top ten podcasts if you want to learn about…





The best of the podcast





We talked about:
• How brands are a reflection of how consumers are feeling;
• What Donald Trump’s rise means for brands;
• The craft beer wars in the US;
• Why bigger isn’t necessarily better anymore;
• Disruption in the FinTech space;
• Why there should be pressure on bigger established companies to innovate;
• And the coming together of startup and corporate culture.
Adam Hanft on…
Brands
Brands don’t function in a vacuum disconnected from the larger culture, brands are very much a reflection of how consumers are feeling in general about their lives and about the institutions around them.
Branding
Branding is often misinterpreted as this ornament or this veneer that goes on top of a product. But in the purest and the right sense of branding it is really inseparable from the product … Think about brand as a combination, an elegant fusion of product and experience, and value in terms of not just your value proposition but values with a capital V – ‘what is the mission of the company?’.
Language
Language always changes fast. Technology accelerates it and I think we are going to see even more and more new language emerge. We are going to see also more tribalism because people use short-hand to create bonds and to create intimacy in groups.
Social media
I think social media is a powerful way for big brands to break down walls and establish intimacy.
Individuality
Technology allows people to be identified as individuals and companies and brands that don’t identify people as individuals are in trouble long term … Individuality is very much a millennial value. Boomers also have that desire. Different generations express it or internalise it in different ways.
Corporations and customers
If you are big and powerful then you should be able to use your muscle, your clout, your resources, to make my life better. You should be able to give me better credit scoring to that point or better rates or better customer service. Better products. More imaginative, innovative products than a start-up. I think you need to focus your strength on making the lives better to consumers through your resources, as opposed to just putting a marketing veneer on something.
Gardening and start-ups
I often use the analogy of gardening. A big tree takes a long time to die but it will die eventually. A small tree or plant can go quickly. I think start-ups are like the small trees. They have got to be positioned right, quickly, they need to get traction right away. They need to establish roots and they need nurturing. Big companies have the luxury of a longer-term horizon.
