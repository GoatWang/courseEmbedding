A Practical Approach to GIS 










ArdentMC’s focus on Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) represents a customer-centric approach rather than a subject-matter-centric approach.  Historically, Geospatial Information Systems have represented models of finer degrees of precision, and nuanced feature information that provides an increasingly realistic representation of the world around us.  At the same time, the commoditization of visualization capabilities has resulted in explosive growth in the web-based, mash-up market that is the dominant way most users first experience location-based technologies.  ArdentMC harnesses these commodity technologies, connects them to high precision GIS systems, and integrates the same with organizational mission systems, to deliver a GIS experience that focuses on the needs of the end-user. This approach represents ArdentMC’s Practical Approach to GIS that we expect will increase the number of GIS users in the years to come.























 










Approach to Changing TechnologyThe geospatial industry has undergone tremendous change in the recent past, moving away from complex/niche environments to mobile, lightweight, and rich-end user environments.  ArdentMC welcomes and adopts this change in our beliefs around geospatial/location based technologies that end user requirements are no longer dictated by market available geospatial technology, rather that geospatial technology is an enabler of business and mission systems.  ArdentMC’s success is driven by our beliefs and approach in technology coupled with our client dedication, allowing for successful delivery and long standing relationships. 
















Client FocusArdentMC’s success is only gained through our client’s success.  As a small business, ArdentMC focuses on the client delivery through requirements and dedicated relationships.  ArdentMC has had its success in delivering geospatial systems through this client focus, building strong capabilities through long standing client engagements.  ArdentMC has been supporting clients with a focus on geospatial capabilities within the Homeland Security mission space, starting with the development of the Infrastructure Common Analytic Viewer (iCAV) 6 years ago to our current work supporting National Common Operating Picture system development.  While ArdentMC has a growing client base, much of this growth has been through existing client recommendations which to us, is the best kind of growth.  This allows ArdentMC to continue client delivery and build client relationships through close ties and program integration. Our value to clients is not in how many add-on’s we bring, rather how our understanding of program goals and mission needs is delivered through geospatial technology.

								                        Increasing Visibility and Success							                         

								                        Critical client projects grow in complexity quickly. Ensuring a method is available to objectively evaluate their success is the only way to deliver transparency and accountability. ArdentMC helps Federal agencies do both.							                         














								                        Outside of the Beltway							                         

								                        ArdentMC supports federal clients from across the nation including DC metro, Maui, Hawaii, Oregon, New Hampshire, and many more. We have resource available per client request wherever the client is located.							                         














								                        Cloud Based Offering							                         

								                        ArdentMC has experience with migrating and supporting Federal clients in the cloud.							                         














								                        A Practical Perspective							                         

								                        Our approach to Geospatial Information Services leverages a practical perspective, which delivers tangible results in the shortest time period possible. We focus on delivering highly relevant GIS capabilities to the broad communities of non-practitioners, the mission-owners.							                         














								                        Low Risk, High Value							                         

								                        ArdentMC’s software development couples the rapid development capabilities of Agile with the rigor of Federal Enterprise Architecture and Engineering Lifecycles, termed Agile+. Agile+ allows Federal agencies to take a low-risk, high-value approach to rapid software development.
