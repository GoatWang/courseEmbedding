VISION & VALUES 
CORPORATE LEADERSHIP
PRESENTATIONS



Corporate Overview



  
  Independence Contract Drilling is a premium land drilling services provider. From our Houston rig-up yard and corporate headquarters we develop and assemble our ShaleDriller® series rig design based on E&P operator feedback and field requirements. ShaleDrillers are designed for field safety, rig up and down with pins at man level - they are fast moving and capable of walking in multiple directions. The ShaleDriller series rigs are AC programmable, energy efficient BiFuel, and custom designed to be best in class for the development of our clients' most demanding and financially impactful exploration and development programs. We excel in shale plays and other areas where completions require long horizontal sections, drilling quickly and accurately to minimize open hole time and shale swelling. We also excel where multi-well pads offer the option to walk between well bores and provide the opportunity to plan 3 hour release-to-spud times.
Unlike skidding rigs, ShaleDriller's true multi-directional walking systems are not slowed down by mis-aligned wellbores and can walk over existing wellheads.
Each Independence Contract Drilling ShaleDriller rig is:
Safe

Rig-up      / rig-down – pins at man level, no use of hoists 
No      cranes required to rig up or down   
Fast Drilling – AC Programmable  VFD Controlled

AC      programmed, flat screen joy stick systems provide precise control of key      drilling parameters to maximize rate of penetration, provide longer bit      life, fewer bit trips and lower well costs than mechanical or DC rigs.   Clients drill more wells per rig/year and accelerate cash flows as      wells come on line sooner than with legacy mechanical and DC rigs. 

Energy Efficient
BiFuel and AC programming have proven to offer our clients significant fuel cost reductions, in some cases up to 48%.
  

Fast moving - site to site 

Rig      design is based on minimizing loads and reducing cycle times. Rig up      and down does not require the use of cranes.   
Fast moving - on site 

All      rigs can be configured to walk in multiple directions over existing      wellheads – three hour release to spud times. 
In short, ICD ShaleDriller walking rigs provide a compelling value proposition to our customers, well above legacy mechanical and DC equipment and skidding AC rigs. The fine control of key drilling parameters offered by ShaleDriller  drilling systems allows same-class wells to be drilled in half the time required by mechanical or DC equipment. The combination of the ShaleDriller’s “Safety by Design” engineering process, more efficient mobilization and AC/VFD drilling controls allows our customers to drill more wells per rig per year.

 Independence Contract Drilling, Inc. (NYSE:ICD) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementItem 1.01

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

On July 14, 2017, Independence Contract Drilling, Inc. (the “Company”) amended and restated its existing credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions led by CIT Finance, LLC (the “Second A&R Credit Facility”). The Second A&R Credit Facility maintains the aggregate commitments under the facility at $85 million and extends the maturity date two years to November 5, 2020. In addition, the Second A&R Credit Facility provides for an additional uncommitted $65.0 million accordion feature that allows for future increases in facility commitments.
The Second A&R Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. Borrowings by the Company are subject to a borrowing base formula that allows for borrowings of up to 85% of eligible trade accounts receivable not more than 90 days outstanding, plus up to 75% of the appraised forced liquidation value of the Company’s eligible, completed and owned drilling rigs. Beginning on December 31, 2017, the 75% advance rate on the Company’s eligible completed and owned drilling rigs decreases by 1.25%per quarter, subject to a floor of 65%. At June 30, 2017, the Company’s aggregate borrowings under the credit facility were $39.0 million and the borrowing base was $89.7 million. Proforma for the amendments included in the Second A&R Credit Facility, the Company’s borrowing base was $95.4 million.
Pricing under the Second Amended Credit Facility remains unchanged. At the Company’s election, interest under the Second A&R Credit Facility is determined by reference to either (i)the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), plus 4.5% or (ii)a “base rate” equal to the higher of the prime rate published by JP Morgan Chase Bank, the federal funds effective rate plus 0.05% or three-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, 3.5%. The Company also pays, on a quarterly basis, a commitment fee of 0.50%per annum on the average daily amount of the available commitments under the credit facility.
The Second A&R Credit Facility contains various amendments to the financial and other covenants to accommodate the extension in term, including the leverage ratio covenant, fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and rig utilization ratio covenant as follows:
(a)modifies the Leverage Ratio covenant (defined as Net Funded Debt to EBITDA) to provide as follows as of the following dates:





September 30, 2017: 4.00








September 30, 2018: 3.75








September 30, 2019: 3.25








December 31, 2019 and thereafter: 3.00.



Under the Second A&R Credit Facility, for purposes of calculating EBITDA, non-cash stock-based compensation expense is added back to EBITDA as well as up to $2.0 million of previously capitalized construction costs that may be incurred in 2017.
(b)modifies the Rig Utilization Ratio covenant to provide for 70% utilization in 2017 and 75% thereafter, but further provides that the Utilization Covenant will not be tested when aggregate borrowings under the facility fall below $30 million. For purposes of calculating the Rig Utilization Ratio, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement continues to exclude decommissioned rigs, rigs under repair and rigs never included in the credit facility borrowing base for purposes of calculating the Rig Utilization Ratio.
(c)modifies the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant to exclude the following items for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Ratio under this covenant: (1) capital expenditures incurred prior to July 1, 2017; (2) capital expenditures relating to the completion of newbuild rigs 213 and 214, subject to certain conditions including the Company obtaining contracts with one year or greater terms upon initial mobilization of such rigs, and (3) up to $1.0 million of additional capital expenditures incurred after July 1, 2017 associated with the Rig 218 conversion.
Additionally, the Second A&R Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the Company and any future subsidiaries to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified capital stock, transfer or sell assets, pay dividends or distributions, redeem subordinated indebtedness, make certain types of investments or make other restricted payments, create or incur liens, consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all assets and engage in business other than a business that is the same or similar to the current business and reasonably related businesses. The Second A&R Credit Facility does, however, permit the Company to incur up to $60.0 million of permitted subordinated indebtedness as well as up to $20 million of indebtedness associated with the purchase of additional rig equipment.
The foregoing description of the Second A&R Credit Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the facility, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
       Item 1.01   Regulation FD Disclosure   Members of senior management of Independence Contract Drilling expect to meet with investors on July 18th and 19th, 2017.

HOUSTON, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Independence Contract Drilling, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:    ICD) today reported financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2017.  
Second Quarter 2017 Highlights

Net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.17 per share. 
Adjusted net loss, as defined below, of $5.0 million, or $0.13 per share. 
Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, of $3.2 million. 
Fleet utilization of 93.9%. 
Revenue days of 1,111. 
Margin per day, excluding reactivation and construction costs, of $5,275 per day.









In the second quarter of 2017, the Company reported revenues of $21.3 million, a net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.17 per share, an adjusted net loss (defined below) of $5.0 million, or $0.13 per share, and adjusted EBITDA (defined below) of $3.2 million.  This compares to revenues of $20.2 million, a net loss of $6.3 million, or $0.17 per share, an adjusted net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.14 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, and revenues of $15.2 million, a net loss of $4.2 million, or $0.12 per share, an adjusted net loss of $2.2 million, or $0.07 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $5.4 million in the second quarter of 2016.  
Chief Executive Officer Byron Dunn commented, "We currently have our entire fleet contracted, with our 14th rig scheduled to spud its first well by the end of the month under a multi-year contract.   We believe the U.S. fleet of pad-optimal rigs has reached full effective utilization, and dayrates have improved to the high teens – low $20,000 per day range.  We continue to have success recontracting rigs on term contracts at improving rates."
Quarterly Operational Results
In the second quarter of 2017, the Company's fleet operated at 93.9% utilization and recorded 1,111 revenue days compared to 91.7% utilization and 1,073 revenue days in the first quarter of 2017 and 65.6% utilization and 732 revenue days in the second quarter of 2016.  There were no revenue days earned on a standby-without-crew basis in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 69 days in the first quarter of 2017 and 362.9 days in the second quarter of 2016.  
Second quarter 2017 fully-burdened rig operating margins, excluding reactivation and rig construction costs, were $5,275 per day, compared to $6,019 per day in the first quarter of 2017 and $11,359 per day in the second quarter of 2016.   The decrease in operating margin per day resulted primarily from a reduction in revenue days earned under higher dayrate legacy contracts compared to prior quarters.
Operating revenues in the second quarter of 2017 totaled $21.3 million, compared to $20.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $15.2 million in the second quarter of 2016.  On a revenue-per-day basis, revenues were $18,201 per day in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $17,949 in the first quarter of 2017 and $20,116 in the second quarter of 2016.  
Operating costs in the second quarter of 2017 totaled $15.8 million, compared to $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2016.  Second quarter 2017 operating costs included $0.4 million of reactivation costs.  First quarter 2017 operating costs included $0.7 million of reactivation costs and $0.2 million of rig construction costs.  Fully-burdened operating costs, excluding reactivation and rig construction costs, were $12,926 per day in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $11,930 in the first quarter of 2017 and $8,757 in the second quarter of 2016.  The sequential increase in costs per day related to a decrease in revenue days earned on a standby-without-crew basis, where revenue is recognized without an operating cost offset, as well as increased costs for repair and maintenance and new hire mentoring initiatives. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2017 were $3.4 million (including $1.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation), compared to $3.7 million (including $1.0 million of non-cash stock-based compensation) in the first quarter of 2017 and $5.0 million (including $1.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation and retirement expense of $1.5 million) in the second quarter of 2016.  The sequential decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses compared to the first quarter of 2017 related primarily to a reduction in professional fees and incentive compensation accruals and the impact of the Company's 2016 restructuring efforts, partially offset by costs for expanded new hire training programs.    
Drilling Operations Update
All 14 of the Company's ShaleDriller® rigs are contracted and out in the field, with the 14th rig scheduled to spud its first well by the end of July 2017 under a multi-year contract.   
At June 30, 2017, the Company's backlog of revenues from contracts with original terms of six months or more was $70.7 million, compared to $42.5 million as of December 31, 2016.  Approximately $40.7 million of this backlog is expected to be realized during the remainder of 2017.
Capital Expenditures and Liquidity Update
Aggregate cash outlays for capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2017, net of disposals, were $7.7 million. In addition, at June 30, 2017, accounts payable included approximately $5.3 million of capital expenditures principally associated with the Company's final rig conversion. The Company's capital expenditure budget, before disposals, for the remainder of 2017 is expected to be approximately $4.4 million. At June 30, 2017, the Company had $6.4 million of assets classified as held for sale.
As of June 30, 2017, the Company had drawn $39.0 million on its $85.0 million revolving credit facility and had net debt, excluding capital leases, of $33.5 million.  The borrowing base under the Company's credit facility was $89.7 million as of June 30, 2017.  Subsequent to June 30, 2017, the Company amended the terms of the credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity until November 5, 2020.

The following table provides various financial and operational data for the Company's operations during the three months ending June 30, 2017 and 2016 and March 31, 2017 and the six months ending June 30, 2017 and 2016.  This information contains non-GAAP financial measures of the Company's operating performance.  The Company believes this non-GAAP information is useful because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our management.  Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons.  However, this information has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income (loss) or cash flow performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, as this information excludes certain costs that may affect the Company's operating performance in future periods.

 (1) 
 Rig operating days represent the number of days our rigs are earning revenue under a contract during the period, including days that standby revenues are earned.  For the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and March 31, 2017 there were zero, 368.4 and 77.9 operating days in which the Company earned revenue on a standby basis, respectively, including zero, 362.9 and 69.0 standby-without-crew days, respectively.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 there were 77.9 and 554.1 operating days in which the Company earned revenue on a standby basis, respectively, including 69.0 and 525.0 standby-without-crew days, respectively. 






 (2) 
 Average number of operating rigs is calculated by dividing the total number of rig operating days in the period by the total number of calendar days in the period.   






 (3) 
 Rig utilization is calculated as rig operating days divided by the total number of days our drilling rigs are available during the applicable period. During the third quarter of 2015, we elected to remove our two 100 Series non-walking rigs from the marketed fleet pending completion of their planned rig conversions to 200 Series, pad-optimal status.  The conversion of one of the 100 series rig was completed during the second quarter of 2016 and the rig re-entered the marketed fleet in June 2016.  The conversion of the second 100 series rig was completed in the second quarter of 2017 and the rig will begin operating in July 2017.    






 (4) 
 Average revenue per operating day represents total contract drilling revenues earned during the period divided by rig operating days in the period.  Excluded in calculating average revenue per operating day are revenues associated with the reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs paid by customers of $1.1 million, $0.4 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively, and $2.0 million and $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Included in calculating average revenue per operating day for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of early termination revenues associated with a contract termination at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The first and second quarter of 2017 did not include any early termination revenues. 






 (5) 
 Average cost per operating day represents total direct operating costs incurred during the period divided by rig operating days in the period.  The following costs are excluded in calculating average cost per operating day: (i) out-of-pocket costs reimbursed by customers of $1.1 million, $0.4 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively and $2.0 million and $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (ii) new crew training costs of $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and March 31, 2017, and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, (iii) construction overhead costs expensed due to reduced rig construction activity of zero, $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively, and $0.2 million and $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, (iv) rig reactivation costs for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 of $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and $1.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 (excluding $0.1 million of new crew training costs (included in (ii) above)), and (v) out-of-pocket expenses of $0.1 million, net of insurance recoveries, incurred as a result of damage to one of our rig's mast during the first quarter of 2017. 




Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.  In addition, adjusted EBITDA is consistent with how EBITDA is calculated under our revolving credit facility for purposes of determining our compliance with various financial covenants.  We define "EBITDA" as earnings (or loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and we define "adjusted EBITDA" as EBITDA before stock-based compensation, non-cash asset impairments, gains or losses on disposition of assets, and other non-recurring items added back to, or subtracted from, net income for purposes of calculating EBITDA under our revolving credit facility.  Neither adjusted net loss, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA is a measure of net income as determined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
Management believes adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow our stockholders to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compliance with various financial covenants under our revolving credit facility and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure or non-recurring, non-cash transactions. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in calculating adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. None of adjusted net loss, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA should be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's return of assets, cost of capital and tax structure. Our presentation of adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.  Our computations of adjusted net loss, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Company Summary


Independence Contract Drilling is a premium land drilling services provider. From our Houston rig-up yard and corporate headquarters we develop and assemble our ShaleDriller(TM) series rig design based on E&P operator feedback and field requirements. ShaleDrillers are designed for field safety, rig up and down with pins at man level - they are fast moving and capable of walking in multiple directions. The ShaleDriller series rigs are AC, programmable, energy efficient BiFuel with custom designed to be best in class for the development of our clients' most demanding and financially impactful exploration and development programs. We excel in shale plays and other areas where completions require long horizontal sections, drilled quickly and accurately to minimize open hole time and shale swelling, and where multi-well pads offer the option to walk between well bores and provide the opportunity to plan 3 hour release-to-spud times.

In short, ICD ShaleDriller walking rigs provide a compelling value proposition to our customers, well above legacy mechanical and DC equipment and skidding AC systems. The fine control of key drilling parameters offered by ShaleDriller drilling systems allows same-class wells to be drilled in half the time required by mechanical or DC equipment. The combination of the ShaleDriller's "Safety by Design" engineering process, more efficient mobilization and AC/VFD drilling controls allows our customers to drill more wells per rig per year.
