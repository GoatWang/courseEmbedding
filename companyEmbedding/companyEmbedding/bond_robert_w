Parker Announces Retirement Of Robert W. Bond, Vice President Of EBusiness, IoT And Services; Board Elects Michael Chung As Successor






GlobeNewswire



Jun 16, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































 CLEVELAND, June 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Parker Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), the global leader in motion and control technologies, today announced that Robert W. Bond, Vice President - eBusiness, IoT and Services, will retire after 40 years of dedicated service to the company. The Board of Directors has elected Michael Chung, currently Vice President and President - Automation Group, to succeed Mr. Bond effective August 1, 2017.                  Michael Chung            "Bob's retirement marks the end of a truly outstanding career at Parker. For a decade, he led the Fluid Connectors Group through a period of rapid global expansion and record-setting financial performance.  More recently, Bob has accelerated Parker's digital transformation to position the company for the future," said Tom Williams, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "I want to thank Bob for his transformational leadership and for the lasting impact his contributions have left on Parker and those around him. We wish Bob and his wife Sharon the very best in retirement." Mr. Bond will be assisting Michael Chung during the transition. Mr. Bond began his Parker career in Canada in 1977, working in various positions in materials and operations management. He was named General Manager of Quick Coupling Division in 1992, and subsequently became Vice President of Operations for the Fluid Connectors Group, and in 2000 President of the Automation Group. Mr. Bond became Vice President and President - Fluid Connectors Group in 2005, and Vice President - eBusiness, IoT and Services in 2015. While leading the Fluid Connectors Group, Mr. Bond successfully balanced significant global expansion, numerous acquisitions and the development of innovative new products and services, enabling the group to achieve strong performance. As Vice President - eBusiness, IoT and Services, he was responsible for driving the development of Parker's eBusiness platform, expanding the company's global service offering across all technologies, and establishing a foundation for Parker's Internet of Things initiative. As key goals of the Win Strategy, these initiatives will contribute significantly to improving the customer experience and Parker's financial performance.
