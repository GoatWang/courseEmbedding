and a national market system, and, in
general, to protect investors and the
public interest.
The Commission notes that the
proposed rule change is designed to
simplify and standardize delegations of
authority under the CBOE Rules. The
Commission notes that, under the
proposed rule change, the Exchange
would have the flexibility to delegate
authorities under its rules to Exchange
staff or an Exchange committee, as
appropriate, which could foster greater
efficiency from an administrative
perspective. The Commission further
notes that the Exchange has not
proposed any revisions to its current
disciplinary, arbitration or appeals
procedures (or related Business
Conduct, Arbitration and Appeals
Committees) as part of the proposed rule
change. The Commission believes that
CBOE’s proposal is consistent with the
requirements of the Act.

as one establishing or changing a
member due, fee, or other charge
imposed by ISE under Section
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act 3 and Rule 19b–
4(f)(2) thereunder,4 which renders the
proposal effective upon filing with the
Commission. The Commission is
publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.

III. Conclusion
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,11 that the
proposed rule change (SR–CBOE–2008–
02) is hereby approved.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Purpose of, and
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule
Change
In its filing with the Commission, ISE
included statements concerning the
purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any
comments it received on the proposed
rule change. The text of these statements
may be examined at the places specified
in Item IV below. ISE has prepared
summaries, set forth in Sections A, B,
and C below, of the most significant
aspects of such statements.

For the Commission, by the Division of
Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated
authority.12

represents that TAN is eligible for
options trading because it constitutes an
‘‘Exchange-Traded Fund Share,’’ as
defined by ISE Rule 502(h).
All of the applicable fees covered by
this filing are identical to fees charged
by the Exchange for all other Premium
Products. Specifically, the Exchange is
proposing to adopt an execution fee and
a comparison fee for all transactions in
options on TAN.7 The amount of the
execution fee and comparison fee for
products covered by this filing shall be
$0.15 and $0.03 per contract,
respectively, for all Public Customer
Orders 8 and Firm Proprietary orders.
The amount of the execution fee and
comparison fee for all ISE Market Maker
transactions shall be equal to the
execution fee and comparison fee
currently charged by the Exchange for
ISE Market Maker transactions in equity
options.9 Finally, the amount of the
execution fee and comparison fee for all
non-ISE Market Maker transactions shall
be $0.37 and $0.03 per contract,
respectively.10 Further, since options on
TAN are multiply-listed, the Exchange’s
Payment for Order Flow fee shall apply
to this product. The Exchange believes
the proposed rule change will further
the Exchange’s goal of introducing new
products to the marketplace that are
competitively priced.
2. Statutory Basis
The Exchange believes that the
proposed rule change is consistent with
the objectives of Section 6 of the Act,11
connection with the listing, provision of a market
for trading, marketing, and promotion of options on
TAN or with making disclosures concerning
options on TAN under any applicable federal or
state laws, rules or regulations. MAC and Claymore
Securities do not sponsor, endorse, or promote such
activity by ISE, and are not affiliated in any manner
with ISE.
7 These fees will be charged only to Exchange
members. Under a pilot program that is set to expire
on July 31, 2008, these fees will also be charged to
Linkage Principal Orders (‘‘Linkage P Orders’’) and
Linkage Principal Acting as Agent Orders (‘‘Linkage
P/A Orders’’). The amount of the execution fee
charged by the Exchange for Linkage P Orders and
Linkage P/A Orders is $0.24 per contract side and
$0.15 per contract side, respectively. See Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 56128 (July 24, 2007), 72

8 Public Customer Order is defined in Exchange
Rule 100(a)(39) as an order for the account of a
Public Customer. Public Customer is defined in
Exchange Rule 100(a)(38) as a person or entity that
is not a broker or dealer in securities.
9 The execution fee is currently between $.21 and
$.12 per contract side, depending on the Exchange
Average Daily Volume, and the comparison fee is
currently $.03 per contract side.
10 The amount of the execution and comparison
fee for non-ISE Market Maker transactions executed
in the Exchange’s Facilitation and Solicitation
Mechanisms is $0.16 and $0.03 per contract,
respectively.

Section 6(b)(4),12 in particular, in that it
is designed to provide for the equitable
allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among its members and
other persons using its facilities.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Burden on Competition
The proposed rule change does not
impose any burden on competition that
is not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Comments on the
Proposed Rule Change Received From
Members, Participants or Others
The Exchange has not solicited, and

this proposed rule change. The

Commission Action

has been designated as a fee change
pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the
Act 13 and Rule 19b–4(f)(2)14
thereunder, because it establishes or

imposed on members by ISE.
Accordingly, the proposal is effective

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

Weekly Options

ISE options exchanges offers short-term options series (“Weeklies”) on underlyings.
Short-term options series trade for approximately 50 products one week and expire on Fridays, unless Friday is a trading holiday. Select symbols have weeklies going out as far as five weeks, pursuant to ISE Rule 504.02.
ISE options exchanges will list new Weeklies on Thursday of each week expiring the following Friday. Weeklies on AM-settled indexes will stop trading at close of business on the Thursday prior to expiration. Weeklies on equities and ETFs will stop trading at close of business on Friday (expiration day). Weeklies on ISE FX Options will stop trading at noon on Friday (expiration day).
ISE, ISE Gemini, and ISE Mercury are allowed to list up to 60 series in each weekly class. In the event of unusual market movement or significant customer demand, each exchange will list new series up to two days prior to expiration. Weeklies are subject to corporate action adjustment as their standard counterparts.
The option symbols of Weeklies are identical to those used for standard monthly options. The difference between monthly and weekly options is the expiration date. The series name of Weeklies is structured as follows:


Underlying symbol
1-character Expiration Year
3-character Expiration Month
Strike Price with one decimal place
Call/Put Indicator
“-DD” (Expiration Day)


An example series name for a weekly is BAC3FEB11.0C-08.
Please visit our Product Lookup page for a full list of Weeklies.

        June 20, 2012.
        I. Introduction
On March 9, 2012, the International Securities Exchange, LLC (“Exchange” or “ISE”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act” or “Act”) [1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 

           a proposed rule change to list and trade options on the ISE Max SPY Index (“ISE Max SPY”). The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on March 22, 2012.[3] 
           The Commission received three comment letters on the proposed rule change.[4] 
           On May 1, 2012, the Commission extended the time period for Commission action to June 20, 2012.[5] 
           On May 4, 2012, ISE submitted a response to the comment letters [6] 
           and filed Amendment No. 1 to  the proposed rule change.[7] 
           The Commission subsequently received three additional comment letters [8] 
           and a second response letter from ISE.[9] 
           All the comment letters received, including ISE's response letters, are available on the Commission's Web site.[10] 

This order institutes proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1. Institution of these proceedings, however, does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to the proposed rule change, nor does it mean that the Commission will ultimately disapprove the proposed rule change. Rather, as addressed below, the Commission desires to solicit additional input from interested parties on the issues presented by the proposed rule change.
II. Description of the Proposal
As set forth in more detail in the Notice, ISE proposes to list and trade options, including long-term options, on the ISE Max SPY Index, which is “designed to represent 10 times the value of the published share prices in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF [(“SPY”)] Trust.” [11] 
           Options on the ISE Max SPY Index would be European-style and p.m. cash-settled, and they would be quoted and traded in U.S. dollars.
According to ISE, the real-time value of the ISE Max SPY Index is calculated by multiplying the share prices of SPY by a factor of ten and rounding to the tenth place. This value would be calculated by ISE or its agent, and would be disseminated by ISE every 15 seconds during its regular trading hours to market information vendors via the Options Price Reporting Authority.[12] 

ISE proposes to calculate the settlement value for options on the ISE Max SPY Index using the net asset value (“NAV”) of the fund, as calculated by ISE, on a per share basis, times ten. ISE states that the method it will use for calculating the NAV of SPY is the same method that is used industry-wide for calculating the NAV of an exchange traded fund (“ETF”) with equity-only holdings, and is the per-share dollar amount of the fund, which is calculated by dividing the total value of all the securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities, by the number of fund shares outstanding.[13] 
           ISE also states that the settlement value that it calculates may be different from the NAV published by the trustee of the SPY trust.[14] 
           In calculating the settlement value for options on the ISE Max SPY Index, ISE states that it would use the published closing prices from the primary market of the SPY trust's portfolio securities.[15] 

As proposed, Exchange rules that are applicable to the trading of options on broad-based indexes would apply to the trading of options on the ISE Max SPY Index.[16] 
           Specifically, the trading of options on the ISE Max SPY Index would be subject to, among others, Exchange rules governing margin requirements and trading halt procedures for index options. The trading of options on the ISE Max SPY Index also would be subject to the Exchange's customer protection rules.[17] 

ISE proposes that options on the ISE Max SPY Index be approved on a pilot basis for an initial period of 14 months. ISE states that if it were to propose an extension of the program or propose to make the program permanent, then it would submit a filing proposing such amendments to the program. ISE notes that any positions established under the pilot would not be impacted by the expiration of the pilot.[18] 
           As part of the pilot program, ISE would submit a pilot program report to the Commission at least two months prior to the expiration date of the program (“annual report”). The annual report would contain an analysis of volume, open interest and trading patterns. The analysis would examine trading in the proposed option product as well as trading in the securities that comprise the S&P 500 index. In addition, for series that exceed certain minimum open interest parameters, the annual report would provide analysis of index price volatility and share trading activity. In addition to the annual report, ISE committed to provide the Commission with periodic interim reports while the pilot is in effect that would contain some, but not all, of the information contained in the annual report. In its filing, ISE notes that it would provide the annual and interim reports to the Commission on a confidential basis.
Comment Letters
As noted above, the Commission received six comment letters and two  ISE response letters on the proposed rule change.[19] 

One commenter expresses support for the proposed rule change and states that it “generally applaud[s] efforts to provide investors with additional opportunities to invest using listed options.” [20] 
           In particular, this commenter supports ISE's proposal to allow p.m. settlement for options on the ISE Max SPY Index.[21] 
           This commenter also supports the proposal to impose no position limits for options on the ISE Max SPY Index.[22] 
           This commenter states that a key part of its basis for agreeing with the proposed position limits is the fact that “there is a very large degree of economic equivalence between options on [ISE's] proposed index and the existing C2 SPXPM product.” [23] 

Two commenters oppose the proposed rule change for the reasons discussed below.
A. Pending Litigation; Potential for Market Disruption and Harm to Investors
Two commenters argue that the proposed options are, in fact, options on the S&P 500 index and therefore would violate a permanent injunction entered by the Illinois state court in 2010 (“Injunction”).[24] 
           These two commenters have filed a motion to enforce this Injunction against ISE in Illinois Circuit Court,[25] 
           and request that the Commission disapprove the proposed rule change [26] 
           or not take action to approve the proposed rule change until the litigation is resolved.[27] 
           In a second comment letter, CBOE argues that the Commission should disapprove the proposed options because they could not legally be traded.[28] 
           In addition, CBOE requests that if the Commission considers the proposed rule change prior to judicial action on the motion, the Commission should make clear that any approval is solely concerned with whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, and that the Illinois state court has full and independent authority to resolve the issues that arise under state law.[29] 

In its response letter, ISE states that it is opposing the motion to enforce the Injunction.[30] 
           ISE objects to the commenters' request that the Commission delay approval of the proposed rule change until the Illinois court decides on the motion, referring to prior Commission action where the Commission indicated that its decision to approve a rule filing should be based solely on whether it complies with the Act, without regard to any state law issues.[31] 
           ISE states that because the current Illinois proceedings involve issues of intellectual property law and state procedure, the Commission should approve this proposed rule change without regard to the Illinois proceedings.[32] 

According to the two commenters, significant market disruption and harm to investors could occur if the Commission were to approve the proposed rule change prior to the Illinois court ruling on whether the proposed options violate the existing Injunction or are otherwise unlawful.[33] 
           Specifically, these commenters express the concern that if ISE commences trading in the proposed options before a decision by the Illinois court where the court finds that such trading is unlawful, investors would have no readily available means to trade out of or exercise their positions in the proposed options.[34] 

In its first response letter, ISE disagrees with the comment that the Commission's approval of the proposed rule change before the Illinois court's ruling on the motion could result in significant market disruption or harm to investors.[35] 
           Nevertheless, ISE represents that, absent returning to the Commission and seeking explicit approval to do so, it will not commence trading options on the ISE Max SPY Index until the Illinois Circuit Court has ruled on the motion.[36] 

In a second comment letter, CBOE reiterates its concerns regarding potential market disruption and harm to investors.[37] 
           In response to ISE's letter, CBOE states that the Illinois lower court's ruling on the motion to enforce the Injunction may not be the end of the litigation over whether the proposed options may be validly traded under state law, and that the Commission should condition any approval on ISE's undertaking not to commence trading until all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved.[38] 

In its second response letter, ISE again represents that it will not launch the proposed options for trading unless and until the Illinois Circuit Court denies the motion to enforce the Injunction.[39] 
           In addition, in the event that the Illinois Circuit Court were to deny the motion to enforce the Injunction, and such a decision was to be subsequently reversed and ISE were to be enjoined from offering the proposed options after it had commenced trading and there is open interest, ISE represents that it would seek to have the state court permit it to continue to offer a market for closing-only transactions for so long as it takes all open interest to wind down in an orderly manner.[40] 
           ISE states that it has systems, rules, and procedures in place that would permit such a closing-only orderly wind down, and that it is “inconceivable that the Court would refuse to permit such a closing-only market.” [41] 

           ISE further states that even if the court were to deny a closing-only market, there are adequate rules and procedures in place, at the exchange and the clearing level, to allow for an orderly wind down of  any open interest.[42] 
           In addition, ISE represents that it will insert a litigation risk discussion into the Options Disclosure Document (“ODD”),[43] 
           which will be substantially similar to the litigation risk language included in prior versions of the ODD with respect to index participation products.[44] 
           Finally, ISE states that these investor protection risks are not unique to the proposed product, and that there have been multiple cases where a market becomes unavailable for the continued trading of a product in which there is open interest.[45] 

B. Potential for Investor Confusion
1. Characterization of the Product as Options on the ISE Max SPY Index
One commenter asserts that ISE's description of the proposed options is inaccurate and misleading.[46] 
           This commenter understands from the filing that the settlement value for options on the ISE Max SPY Index would be calculated differently from all other values of the ISE Max SPY Index, stating that “the settlement value will be calculated by reference to the stocks in the S&P 500 Index as weighted by S&P in its S&P 500 Index.” [47] 
           This commenter argues that the benchmark for the proposed option is not SPY, because the proposed options are not actually settled by reference to SPY.[48] 
           This commenter subsequently asserts that the proposed rule change “misleads investors by falsely characterizing the Proposed Options as options on the ISE Max SPY Index.” [49] 
           Specifically, this commenter states that ISE has admitted that the proposed options would not be settled based on the value of SPY and has failed to set forth any way in which the settlement value for the proposed options would have any relation to the ISE Max SPY Index.[50] 
           This commenter also asserts that the proposed rule change misleads investors by characterizing the proposed option as a broad-based index option, when the ISE Max SPY Index actually consists of only a single component security.[51] 

In response, ISE states that the rule filing makes clear that the ISE Max SPY Index is calculated based on the traded prices of SPY shares, and that the options on the ISE Max SPY Index are settled on the basis of a calculation of the NAV of the SPY trust's assets.[52] 
           Further, to ensure that investors have an ongoing means to access information about options on the ISE Max SPY Index, ISE represents, in its second response letter, that it will: (i) Work with the OCC to amend the ODD to provide a clear and unambiguous description of the product and any unique risks associated with it; (ii) display the contract specifications on its Web site; (iii) create a special web page devoted exclusively to the proposed options, which will describe in plain English all the terms of this product, including index calculation and settlement; and (iv) follow the same marketing process it follows for all of its other new products, which is designed to promote awareness and a clear understanding of the product.[53] 

Further, according to one commenter, to the extent that the “ISE Max SPY Index” is “index-like,” it is only because the SPY trust holds all of the stocks in the S&P 500 index, weighted as the stocks in the S&P 500 index are weighted.[54] 
           This commenter argues that even if the benchmark could be said to have reference to SPY, the benchmark would have only one component security and therefore would not be an index.[55] 

           ISE states in response that an index with one component is still an index and refers to CBOE's micro narrow-based index options and CBOE's indexes that measure the spot yield of individual U.S. Treasury Securities by simply multiplying them by ten (i.e., TNX).[56] 
           In its second letter, CBOE states that, consistent with Section 3 of the Act [57] 
           and the principles set forth in Commission's staff legal bulletin, micro narrow-based indexes may consist of no fewer than two securities and no more than nine securities.[58] 
           CBOE also states that its micro narrow-based index option rule applies only to an underlying benchmark that is itself a security index.[59] 
           With respect to ISE's reference to CBOE's indexes that measure the spot yield of individual U.S. Treasury Securities, CBOE states that “TNX options were not security index options, but instead were interest rate options based on interest rate values that were `indexed' to make the options contracts a suitable size.” [60] 
           CBOE further states that TNX options were regulated as interest rate options and were described for all purposes as interest rate options.[61] 

In response, ISE states that there is no legal requirement that an index consists of more than one component.[62] 

           ISE disagrees with the commenter's rationale that indexes must contain at least two components, and states that the commenter is “backpedaling on its  own past history of creating one-component indexes.” [63] 

2. Clarity and Completeness of the Description of the Options on the ISE Max SPY Index
i. Method for Calculating Settlement Values
One commenter states that ISE is unclear in describing the assets that it would take into account in calculating the settlement value of the proposed options, and points out the differences between ISE's calculation of the NAV of SPY, as described in the Notice, and the trust's calculation of the NAV of SPY.[64] 
           In particular, this commenter points out that ISE omitted the reference to “other assets” of the trust in the description of its calculation methodology.[65] 
           The commenter states that if ISE does not take the “other assets” held in the trust into account in calculating settlement values for the proposed options, its settlement value calculation methodology will “clearly diverge from the method used by the Trustee for the Trust to calculate NAVs for the Trust.” [66] 
           The commenter states that if this is ISE's intent, it needs to be clearly stated in the filing.[67] 

In its response letter, ISE states that the ISE Max SPY Index “is settled by reference to the value of the SPY ETF” and that it is independently calculating the NAV of the SPY ETF using a methodology that closely tracks the methodology that State Street Global Advisors (“SSgA”) uses to calculate the NAV of the SPY ETF.[68] 
           ISE states that generally, the NAV for equity-based ETFs is calculated in the same manner, regardless of who the calculation agent is.[69] 
           ISE further explains that NAV is determined by adding the value of the portfolio securities to the trust's net cash (accrued dividends minus accrued fees and expenses), and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding shares of the fund.[70] 
           ISE states that the net cash amount is usually determined by the fund's administrator, who provides that information to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”).[71] 

In a second comment letter, CBOE reiterates that ISE fails to explain the differences between its calculation of the NAV and the NAV published by the trustee of the trust.[72] 
           CBOE states that ISE's proposal did not make clear that the settlement of the proposed options is based on a calculation of the NAV of the SPY ETF, and that the proposal misleads investors about how ISE would calculate the settlement value.[73] 
           CBOE notes that “ISE states that the NAV calculation of an ETF `generally' is determined by `adding the trust's net cash (accrued dividends minus accrued fees and expenses)' to the value of the portfolio securities,” thereby implying that it would do so as well when computing the settlement value of the proposed options.[74] 

           CBOE states, however, that “ISE is careful never to actually state—either in the ISE Proposal or [ISE Response Letter I]—that it would use dividends and Trust expenses when calculating the settlement value of the Proposed Options.” [75] 
           CBOE further points out that ISE may not be able to include those factors in its calculation because the trust disseminates information about the SPY ETF's net cash at the same time as the information about the value of its stock holdings.[76] 

In a second response letter, ISE specifically sets forth the formula for settlement value calculation, including the formula for calculating the NAV of SPY.[77] 
           ISE states that its NAV calculating method is the same standard method that is used industry-wide for ETFs with equity-only holdings.[78] 
           Specifically, ISE explains that after the close of each trading day, the fund's administrator provides to the NSCC the portfolio securities of the fund, the number of shares of each security, the net cash of the fund, and the shares outstanding of the fund.[79] 
           The NSCC makes this information available to market participants on a daily basis after the close of each trading day.[80] 
           ISE states that, by way of its market data vendor, it will calculate the settlement value using the data received from the NSCC.[81] 

ii. Source of Prices Used in Calculating Settlement Values
One commenter states that ISE is unclear in describing the sources of the prices that it would use in calculating settlement values for the proposed options and that ISE's representation of the trust's NAV calculation is inconsistent with the prospectus.[82] 
           In its response letter, ISE states that the filing clearly identifies the source of the prices—the published closing prices from the primary market of the securities.[83] 
           ISE also disagrees with the comment that its representation is inconsistent with the SPDR prospectus because the trust may independently decide which exchange it deems to be the “primary market” as a source for closing prices.[84] 
           In a second response letter, ISE again states that its calculation of the NAV would be based upon the closing prices from the primary markets of each portfolio security, and that it recognizes that the SPY trust may use different prices because the trustee reserves the right to evaluate portfolio securities independently of closing sale prices if it deems such prices to be “inappropriate.” [85] 

iii. Differences between Settlement Value and All Other Values
One commenter states that ISE's filing “does not contain any explanation of why it proposes to calculate settlement values of the Proposed Benchmark differently from all other values of the Proposed Benchmark.” [86] 
           In its response  letter, ISE explains that it is doing so to decrease the opportunity for manipulation and other abusive trading practices.[87] 
           Specifically, ISE states that a would-be manipulator would need to manipulate the closing price of 500 individual stocks, as opposed to the closing price of one ETF.[88] 
           ISE also states that its calculation of the NAV would allow for a timely settlement of the proposed options.[89] 
           Specifically, ISE states that the obligation of SSgA is to establish a NAV of the SPY ETF before the next day's opening.[90] 
           However, since the OCC requires settlement values to be sent to it the same day as the settlement of an option, ISE cannot rely on the SSgA-published NAV.[91] 

Further, ISE points out that “the concept of utilizing a reference price to settle an index option product that differs from the values of the proposed benchmark is not novel, and is best illustrated in CBOE's AM-settled S&P 500 index [(“SPX”)] options.” [92] 
           In response, CBOE differentiates the settlement of SPX options from the settlement of ISE Max SPY options.[93] 
           Specifically, CBOE states that SOQ [94] 
           represents a modified calculation of the same interest that underlies SPX options during their life—the S&P 500 index.[95] 
           Conversely, CBOE states that ISE would use a different underlying benchmark to calculate the settlement value of the proposed options—the benchmark during the life of the proposed options would be the ISE Max SPY Index (based on the traded prices of SPY), whereas the benchmark at settlement would be a recalculated S&P 500 index.[96] 

iv. Special Dividends and Special Distributions
One commenter states that companies in the S&P 500 index from time to time pay special dividends and make special distributions to their shareholders, and ISE did not explain whether or how the relationship between settlement value and other values would be preserved in such a circumstance.[97] 

In its response letter, ISE states that it has never been a practice of the exchanges to describe the details on dividend processing for components of indexes in rule filings seeking approval of index options.[98] 
           Further, ISE states that because the proposed product is an index option, it does not anticipate adjustments being made to the options as a result of any component dividends, and that this is customary practice for index options.[99] 

3. ODD Amendments
One commenter suggests that the ODD would require supplementation before the proposed options could be listed and traded.[100] 
           First, this commenter states that an investor looking for disclosure with respect to the proposed product might be uncertain as to whether they are described in Chapter III (Options on Equity Securities) or Chapter IV (Index Options) of the ODD.[101] 
           Second, this commenter states that the ODD would need to be supplemented to provide disclosure with respect to the difference between the calculation of the settlement value and all other values of the proposed options.[102] 

In its response letter, ISE states that it will follow the well-settled process for supplementing the ODD to devise disclosure of any risks associated with the proposed options that are determined by the Listed Options Disclosure Committee (“LODC”) [103] 
           to be necessary for disclosure.[104] 
           Further, as discussed above, in its second response letter, ISE represents that it will work with the OCC to amend the ODD to provide a clear and unambiguous description of the proposed options and any unique risks associated with it.[105] 

IV. Proceedings To Determine Whether To Approve or Disapprove SR-ISE-2012-22, as Modified by Amendment No. 1, and Grounds for Disapproval Under Consideration
The Commission is instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved.[106] 
           Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. Institution of disapproval proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as described in greater detail below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide additional comment on the proposed rule change to inform the Commission's analysis of whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.
As discussed above, the proposed rule change would allow ISE to list and trade European-style, p.m. and cash settled options on the ISE Max SPY Index. The proposed options would not be subject to position limits. The real-time value of the ISE Max SPY Index would be calculated by multiplying the share prices of SPY by a factor of ten and rounding to the tenth place, whereas the settlement value of the option would be  based on the NAV of SPY, as calculated by ISE,[107] 
           on a per share basis, times ten.
The section of the Act applicable to the proposed rule change that provides the grounds for the disapproval (or approval) under consideration is Section 6(b)(5),[108] 
           which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed, among other things, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
As discussed above, one commenter supports the proposed rule change,[109] 
           while two commenters oppose the proposed rule change.[110] 
           Commenters raise the concern that the proposed rule change could lead to significant market disruption and harm to investors if ISE commences trading in the proposed options before all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved.[111] 
           In addition, commenters raise concerns regarding whether the proposed new product could be misleading to investors and questioned the accuracy and clarity of ISE's description of the proposed options, including the calculation of the settlement value,[112] 
           the differences between the calculation of the settlement value and all other values of the ISE Max SPY Index,[113] 
           and the characterization of the proposed options as options on the “ISE Max SPY Index.” [114] 

In light of the concerns raised by commenters, the Commission believes that questions remain as to whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, including whether the proposed options are designed to protect investors and the public interest.
V. Procedure: Request for Written Comments
The Commission requests that interested persons provide written submissions of their views, data and arguments with respect to the issues identified above, as well as any others they may have identified with the proposal. In particular, the Commission invites the written views of interested persons concerning whether the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although there do not appear to be any issues relevant to approval or disapproval which would be facilitated by an oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, the Commission will consider, pursuant to Rule 19b-4, any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation.[115] 

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments regarding whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved by August 10, 2012. Any person who wishes to file a rebuttal to any other person's submission must file that rebuttal by August 27, 2012.
The Commission is asking that commenters address the merit of ISE's statements in support of the proposal, in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change. Specifically, the Commission is requesting comment on the following:

What are commenters' views as to whether market disruption and harm to investors would occur if the Commission were to approve the proposed rule change before all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved? In light of the Exchange's representation that it would not start trading the proposed options until the Illinois Circuit Court rules on the motion to enforce the Injunction, and its representation regarding the potential mechanisms to ensure an orderly wind down of trading in the event that ISE is enjoined from offering the product after trading has already begun, do commenters believe any harm would result if the Exchange started trading the proposed options before all judicial challenges to the lawfulness of the proposed options under state law have been resolved? Why or why not?
As outlined above, the Exchange has provided additional detail about how it intends to calculate the settlement value for options on the ISE Max SPY Index.[116] 
           What are commenters' views as to whether the Exchange should provide additional clarity in the filing regarding the calculation methodology for the settlement value of options on the ISE Max SPY Index to mitigate concerns regarding the potential for investor confusion? Please be specific in your response.


As noted above, the Exchange would calculate the value of the ISE Max SPY Index by reference to the traded prices of SPY, times ten, at all times. However, the settlement value of the options on the ISE Max SPY Index would be calculated by reference to the NAV of SPY, as calculated by the Exchange, on a per share basis, times ten.[117] 
           What are commenters' views of the impact, if any, of the differences between the calculation of the settlement value of the proposed options and the value of the ISE Max SPY Index itself on investor understanding of the options on the ISE Max SPY Index? Do commenters believe that the differences between the calculation of the settlement value of the proposed options and the value of the ISE Max SPY Index itself could cause investor confusion? Please explain why or why not.


If commenters believe that the differences between the calculation of the settlement value of the proposed options and the value of the ISE Max SPY Index itself could cause investor confusion, what are commenters' views as to whether the steps that ISE has proposed to take to provide investors with information about the product 118
 would be sufficient to mitigate such concerns?


Do commenters believe that the characterization of the proposed options as options on the “ISE Max SPY Index” would have the potential to cause investor confusion? If so, why? If not, why not? If so, what are commenters' views on whether any potential confusion would be sufficiently mitigated by the steps that ISE has proposed to take to provide investors with information about the product? [119] 
           Please be specific in your response.

     Amendment No. 1 replaced the sentence: “Additionally, the proposed rule change would provide Members and investors with additional opportunities to trade S&P 500® options with a p.m.-settlement feature in an exchange environment and subject to transparent exchange-based rules, and that investors would also benefit from the opportunity to trade in association with this product on Expiration Fridays thereby removing impediments to a free and open market consistent with the Act.” with the sentence: “Additionally, the proposed rule change would provide Members and investors with additional opportunities to trade options on a product that provides exposure to the share prices of SPY with a p.m.-settlement feature in an exchange environment and subject to transparent exchange-based rules, and that investors would also benefit from the opportunity to trade in association with this product on expiration Fridays thereby removing impediments to a free and open market consistent with the Act.” According to ISE, the purpose of the amendment is to correct an erroneous sentence in the Statutory Basis section that could be misinterpreted.

     See Notice, supra note 3 and ISE Response Letter II, supra note 9, at 3. In its second response letter, ISE sets forth its formula for calculating the index settlement value: Isett(t) = NAVSPY(t) × M. See ISE Response Letter II, supra note 9, at 2-3. In this formula, “Isett(t)” is the ISE Max SPY settlement value at time (t), “NAVSPY(t)” is the NAV per share of the SPY trust at time (t) as calculated by ISE, and “M” is the constant multiplier of 10. See id. ISE also provides the formula for calculating NAVSPY(t):

NAVSPY(t) = [Σni=1[P(i) × S(i) + Cash] × [1 − Fee/365]/Shares Outstanding


See id. In this formula, “n” is the number of stocks held by the trust, “P(i)” is the closing price of each stock held by the trust, “S(i)” is the number of shares of each stock held by the trust, “Cash” is the cash held in the trust, “Fee” is the stated fee for the trust, and “Shares Outstanding” is the number of trust shares outstanding. See id. ISE also states that “the net cash amount is determined by adding the accrued dividends of the portfolio securities since the fund's last distribution minus the accrued fees, which are essentially the annual management fees prorated per day.” See id. at 3.

        Back to Citation
      


14.
     ISE explains in its response letters that this difference may result because the trust may independently decide which exchange it deems to be the “primary market” as a source of closing prices, and the trustee reserves the right to evaluate portfolio securities independently of closing sale prices if it deems such prices to be “inappropriate.” See ISE Response Letter I, supra note 6, at 6-7 and ISE Response Letter II, supra note 9, at 3.

     See CBOE Letter I and McGraw-Hill Letter I, supra note 4. According to one commenter, “the ISE rule filing itself violates the Injunction because the Injunction prohibits ISE from listing options on the S&P 500 Index and the submission and notification of the rule filing commences the process of listing such options.” See CBOE Letter I, supra note 4, at 2. Another commenter states that ISE's planned unauthorized use of the S&P 500 index constitutes an unlawful violation of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC's (“S&P”) intellectual property rights. See McGraw-Hill Letter I, supra note 4, at 1 and 4. This commenter urges the Commission to not approve the listing and trading of products that have previously been determined to be unlawful. See id. at 4. In subsequent comment letters, commenters note that the Illinois Appellate Court recently affirmed the lower court's Injunction. See CBOE Letter II, supra note 8, at 6 and McGraw-Hill Letter II, supra note 8, at 1.

ISE states that the commenters' primary basis for claiming that the proposed options are options on the S&P 500 index is “a single, erroneous sentence contained in ISE's 50 page rule filing” and that this sentence “is contained in the basis section of ISE's rule filing, which section is not controlling in terms of the description of the product.” See id. at 3. ISE subsequently amended this sentence in Amendment No. 1. See supra note 7.

     The ODD explains the characteristics and risks of exchange-traded options. Rule 9b-1 under the Act requires, among other things, that broker-dealers furnish the ODD to a customer before accepting an order from the customer to purchase or sell an option contract relating to an options class that is the subject of the ODD, or approve the customer's account for the trading of such option.

See id. at 5. The commenter points out that ISE proposed no position limits for these options by reference to the position limits for the p.m.-settled S&P 500 index (“SPXPM”) options, rather than the position limits for other SPY-based products. See id. Another commenter states that the Commission should be concerned by the misleading disconnect between the name of the proposed options and the manner in which the options would be settled.

Another commenter also reiterates, in its second comment letter, that the proposed options would not be settled based on any value of the ISE Max SPY Index, but rather based on ISE's recalculation of the S&P 500 index, using the same stocks selected by S&P and the same weighting methodology.

CBOE states that “allowing options to trade on a security index comprised of a single component would implicate potentially far-reaching regulatory considerations under the Exchange Act. If the concept of a `security index option' is that elastic, then options on a single equity stock could just as easily be traded as a security index option, through the fiction of creating a reference point to that single stock's prices. That has never before been contemplated, and should not be permitted—at least without deep regulatory examination of the implications of that development.” See CBOE Letter II, supra note 8, at 6.

Another commenter states, in a second comment letter, that “the Commission should not be misled by ISE's oblique reference to the use of a `well known methodology that is intended to track, as closely as possible SSGA's methodology for its calculation of the NAV for the SPY ETF' ” because “[t]he `well-known methodology' that ISE proposes to employ is to use S&P's selection of stocks for inclusion in the S&P 500 and the manner in which those stocks are weighted by S&P for purposes of calculating the S&P 500, both of which are proprietary to S&P.” See McGraw-Hill Letter II, supra note 8, at 2.

In particular, CBOE questions the timing that the information necessary for ISE to make the settlement calculation would be made available. See id. In this regard, CBOE states that “the information on which ISE purportedly would rely to compute the NAV of the SPY ETF would not be available until hours after ISE's admitted deadline.” See id. at 2. Accordingly, CBOE concludes that ISE's proposal “continues to mislead investors about how the Proposed Options would settle.” See id. See also

This commenter further states that “ISE's plan to use the same prices to calculate settlement values that S&P uses to calculate the S&P 500 demonstrates that ISE's true purpose is to replicate the value of the S&P 500 as closely as possible, even though doing so creates the possibility of discontinuities between the settlement values of the Proposed Benchmark and all other values of that benchmark.” See id. at 7. See also CBOE Letter II, supra note 8, at 3 (stating that ISE intends “to replicate European-style, p.m. settled S&P 500 index options” by “divorcing its Proposed Options from all connection to the ISE Max SPY Index value at the most important time—i.e., settlement—and by instead calculating the settlement value on the `closing prices of [the] 500 individual stocks' in the S&P 500 index.”)

     See id. at 5-6. In its second response letter, ISE reiterates that because the trustee is under no obligation to distribute the NAV before the next day's open, ISE will perform its own calculation of the NAV to ensure that the settlement value is transmitted to OCC in time for regular processing of expiring contracts (generally before 6 p.m. ET).

     See ISE Response Letter I, supra note 6, at 4-5. Specifically, ISE states that SPX options use a settlement value calculation called the Special Opening Quotation (“SOQ”), and SOQ is a special calculation of the underlying index where the opening prices of the index components are used to determine the settlement value of options contracts. See id. at 5. According to ISE, because component stocks may open after the primary markets have opened, or not at all, this can result in a settlement value that has a significant discrepancy from the initial index quote. See id. ISE reiterates this point in its second response letter. See ISE Response Letter II, supra note 9, at 4.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        April 5, 2013.
        Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) [1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 
           notice is hereby given that on March 25, 2013, Miami International Securities Exchange LLC (“MIAX” or “Exchange”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange is filing a proposal to amend the MIAX Options Fee Schedule (the “Fee Schedule”) to establish fees applicable to Distributors (described below) of the Top of MIAX (“ToM”) market data product, a direct data feed that features the Exchange's best bid and offer, with aggregate size and last sale information on the MIAX system. While changes to the Fee Schedule pursuant to this proposal are effective upon filing, the Exchange has designated these changes to be operative on April 1, 2013.
The text of the proposed rule change is provided in Exhibit 5. The text of the proposed rule change is also available on the Exchange's Web site at http://www.miaxoptions.com/​filter/​wotitle/​rule_​filing, at MIAX's principal office, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish fees for Distributors of ToM. ToM provides Distributors with a direct data feed that includes the Exchange's best bid and offer, with aggregate size, and last sale information, based on displayable order and quoting interest on the Exchange. The ToM data feed includes data that is identical to the data sent to the processor for the Options Price Regulatory Authority (“OPRA”). The ToM and OPRA data leave the MIAX system at the same time, as required under Section 5.2(c)(iii)(B) of the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Options Price Reporting Authority LLC (the “OPRA Plan”), which prohibits the dissemination of proprietary information on any more timely basis than the same information is furnished to the OPRA System for inclusion in OPRA's consolidated dissemination of options information.[3] 

Start Printed Page 21678
Monthly Fees for ToM
The Exchange proposes to charge monthly fees to Distributors of the ToM market data product. The Fee Schedule will reflect that a “Distributor” of TOM data is any entity that receives a feed of ToM data either directly from MIAX or indirectly through another entity and then distributes it either internally (within that entity) or externally (outside that entity), and that all Distributors would be required to execute a MIAX Distributor Agreement. The monthly Distributor Fee charged will depend on whether the Distributor is an “Internal Distributor” or an “External Distributor,” as defined below.
Internal Distributor
An Internal Distributor is an organization that subscribes to the Exchange for the use of ToM, and is permitted by agreement with the Exchange to provide ToM data to internal users (i.e., users within their own organization). Internal Distributors would be charged a monthly fee of $1,000 per organization.
External Distributor
An External Distributor is an organization that subscribes to the Exchange for the use of ToM, and is permitted by agreement with the Exchange to provide ToM data to both internal users and to external users (i.e., users outside of their own organization). External Distributors will be charged a monthly fee of $5,000 per organization.
Market Data Fees for ToM will be reduced for new Distributors for the first month during which they subscribe to ToM, based on the number of trading days that have been held during such month as of the date on which they subscribe. Such new Distributors will be assessed a pro-rata percentage of the fees described above, which is the percentage of the number of trading days remaining in the affected calendar month as of the date on which they begin to receive the ToM feed divided by the total number of trading days in the affected calendar month.
In addition to MIAX's best bid and offer, with aggregate size and last sale information, Distributors that subscribe to ToM will also receive: opening imbalance condition information; opening routing information; Expanded Quote Range [4] 
           information, as provided in MIAX Rule 503(f)(5); Post-Halt Notification,[5] 
           as provided in MIAX Rule 504(d), and Liquidity Refresh,[6] 
           condition information, as provided in MIAX Rule 515(c)(1)(iii)(A).
This additional information (the “administrative information”) is included in the ToM feed as secondary information. The administrative information is also currently available to MIAX Market Makers via connectivity with the MIAX Express Interface (“MEI”),[7] 
           for which they are assessed connectivity fees. In order to accommodate those who wish to receive the administrative information but who do not wish to subscribe to the ToM product, the Exchange submitted a separate proposed rule change concurrently with the instant proposed rule change,[8] 
           to establish a new category of MIAX participant, an Administrative Information Subscriber “AIS,” to make the administrative information available to AIS' via AIS Port connectivity with MIAX, and to establish testing, connectivity and AIS Port Fees for such participants who wish only to receive the administrative information via connectivity with the MIAX System.
2. Statutory Basis
MIAX believes that its proposal to amend its Fee Schedule is consistent with the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,[9] 
           in general, and with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,[10] 

           in particular, in that it provides an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among distributors of ToM, because all Distributors in each of the respective category of Distributor (i.e., Internal and External) will be assessed the same fees as other Distributors in their category.
In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data:
[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.[11] 

By removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals of the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history. If the free market should determine whether proprietary data is sold to broker-dealers at all, it follows that the price at which such data is sold should be set by the market as well.
In July, 2010, Congress adopted H.R. 4173, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which amended Section 19 of the Act. Among other things, Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended paragraph (A) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Act by inserting the phrase “on any person, whether or not the person is a member of the self-regulatory organization” after “due, fee or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization.” As a result, all SRO rule proposals establishing or changing dues, fees or other charges are immediately effective upon filing regardless of whether such dues, fees or other charges are imposed on members of the SRO, non-members, or both. Section 916 further amended paragraph (C) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Act to read, in pertinent part, “At any time within the 60-day period beginning on the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) [of Section 19(b)], the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend the change in the rules of the self-regulatory organization made thereby, if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. If the Commission Start Printed Page 21679takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under paragraph (2)(B) [of Section 19(b)] to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.”
The Exchange believes that these amendments to Section 19 of the Act reflect Congress's intent to allow the Commission to rely upon the forces of competition to ensure that fees for market data are reasonable and equitably allocated. Although Section 19(b) had formerly authorized immediate effectiveness for a “due, fee or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization,” the Commission adopted a policy and subsequently a rule stating that fees for data and other products available to persons that are not members of the self-regulatory organization must be approved by the Commission after first being published for comment. At the time, the Commission supported the adoption of the policy and the rule by pointing out that unlike members, whose representation in self-regulatory organization governance was mandated by the Act, non-members should be given the opportunity to comment on fees before being required to pay them, and that the Commission should specifically approve all such fees. MIAX believes that the amendment to Section 19 reflects Congress's conclusion that the evolution of self-regulatory organization governance and competitive market structure have rendered the Commission's prior policy on non-member fees obsolete. Specifically, many exchanges have evolved from member-owned, not-for-profit corporations into for-profit, investor-owned corporations (or subsidiaries of investor-owned corporations). Accordingly, exchanges no longer have narrow incentives to manage their affairs for the exclusive benefit of their members, but rather have incentives to maximize the appeal of their products to all customers, whether members or non-members, so as to broaden distribution and grow revenues. Moreover, the Exchange believes that the change also reflects an endorsement of the Commission's determinations that reliance on competitive markets is an appropriate means to ensure equitable and reasonable prices. Simply put, the change reflects a presumption that all fee changes should be permitted to take effect immediately, since the level of all fees are constrained by competitive forces. The Exchange therefore believes that the fees for ToM are properly assessed on non-member Distributors.
The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoaliton v. SEC, No. 09-1042 (D.C. Cir. 2010), although reviewing a Commission decision made prior to the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act, upheld the Commission's reliance upon competitive markets to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for market data:
In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress intended that the market system “evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed” and that the SEC wield its regulatory power “in those situations where competition may not be sufficient,” such as in the creation of a “consolidated transactional reporting system.” [12] 

The court's conclusions about Congressional intent are therefore reinforced by the Dodd-Frank Act amendments, which create a presumption that exchange fees, including market data fees, may take effect immediately, without prior Commission approval, and that the Commission should take action to suspend a fee change and institute a proceeding to determine whether the fee change should be approved or disapproved only where the Commission has concerns that the change may not be consistent with the Act.
MIAX believes that the proposed fee is fair and equitable in accordance with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act, and not unreasonably discriminatory in accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. As described above, the proposed fee is based on pricing that exists in the fee schedules of other exchanges.
Moreover, the decision as to whether or not to subscribe to ToM is entirely optional to all parties. Potential subscribers are not required to purchase the ToM market data feed, and MIAX is not required to make the ToM market data feed available. Subscribers can discontinue their use at any time and for any reason, including due to their assessment of the reasonableness of fees charged. The allocation of fees among Subscribers is fair and reasonable because, if the market deems the proposed fees to be unfair or inequitable, firms can diminish or discontinue their use of this data.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Notwithstanding its determination that the Commission may rely upon competition to establish fair and equitably allocated fees for market data, the NetCoalition Court found that the Commission had not, in that case, compiled a record that adequately supported its conclusion that the market for the data at issue in the case was competitive. MIAX believes that a record may readily be established to demonstrate the competitive nature of the market in question.
There is intense competition between trading platforms that provide transaction execution and routing services and proprietary data products. Transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service. In fact, market data and trade execution are a representative example of joint products with joint costs. The decision whether and on which platform to post an order will depend on the attributes of the platform where the order can be posted, including the execution fees, data quality and price and distribution of its data products. Without the prospect of a taking order seeing and reacting to a posted order on a particular platform, the posting of the order would accomplish little.
Without trade executions, exchange data products cannot exist. Data products are valuable to many end subscribers only insofar as they provide information that end subscribers expect will assist them or their customers in making trading decisions. The costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure, but also the costs of designing, maintaining, and operating the exchange's transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence. The total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs. Moreover, an exchange's customers view the costs of transaction executions and of data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange. A broker-dealer will direct orders to a particular exchange only if the expected revenues from executing trades on the exchange exceed net transaction execution costs and the cost of data that the broker-dealer chooses to buy to support its trading decisions (or those of its customers). The choice of data products is, in turn, a product of the value of the products in making profitable trading decisions. If the cost of the product exceeds its expected Start Printed Page 21680value, the broker-dealer will choose not to buy it.
Moreover, as a broker-dealer chooses to direct fewer orders to a particular exchange, the value of the product to the broker-dealer decreases, for two reasons. First, the product will contain less information, because executions of the broker-dealer's orders will not be reflected in it. Second, and perhaps more important, the product will be less valuable to that broker-dealer because it does not provide information about the venue to which it is directing its orders. Data from the competing venue to which the broker-dealer is directing orders will become correspondingly more valuable.
Thus, a super-competitive increase in the fees charged for either transactions or data has the potential to impair revenues from both products. “No one disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce'.” [13] 
           However, the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of broker-dealers with order flow, since they may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowest-cost trading venues. A broker-dealer that shifted its order flow from one platform to another in response to order execution price differentials would both reduce the value of that platform's market data and reduce its own need to consume data from the disfavored platform. Similarly, if a platform increases its market data fees, the change will affect the overall cost of doing business with the platform, and affected broker-dealers will assess whether they can lower their trading costs by directing orders elsewhere and thereby lessening the need for the more expensive data.
Analyzing the cost of market data distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data. Thus, because it is impossible to create data without a fast, technologically robust, and well-regulated execution system, system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of market data. It would be equally misleading, however, to attribute all of the exchange's costs to the market data portion of an exchange's joint product. Rather, all of the exchange's costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow, executing and/or routing orders, and generating and selling data about market activity. The total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products.
Competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return each platform earns from the sale of its joint products, but different platforms may choose from a range of possible, and equally reasonable, pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs. For example, some platforms may choose to pay rebates to attract orders, charge relatively low prices for market information (or provide information free of charge) and charge relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity. Other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower rebates (or no rebates) to attract orders, setting relatively high prices for market information, and setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity. In this environment, there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering. This would be akin to strictly regulating the price that an automobile manufacturer can charge for car sound systems despite the existence of a highly competitive market for cars and the availability of aftermarket alternatives to the manufacturer-supplied system.
The market for market data products is competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data and strict pricing discipline for the proprietary products themselves. Numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings, trades, and market data itself, providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to produce and distribute their own market data. This proprietary data is produced by each individual exchange, as well as other entities, in a vigorously competitive market.
Broker-dealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow, including eleven existing options markets. Each SRO market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions. Competitive markets for order flow, executions, and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products. The large number of SROs that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products. Each SRO is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products, and many in addition to MIAX currently do, including NASDAQ, CBOE, ISE, NYSE Amex, and NYSEArca. Additionally, order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple broker-dealers' production of proprietary data products. The potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless.
Market data vendors provide another form of price discipline for proprietary data products because they control the primary means of access to end subscribers. Vendors impose price restraints based upon their business models. For example, vendors such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters that assess a surcharge on data they sell may refuse to offer proprietary products that end subscribers will not purchase in sufficient numbers. Internet portals, such as Google, impose a discipline by providing only data that will enable them to attract “eyeballs” that contribute to their advertising revenue. Retail broker-dealers, such as Schwab and Fidelity, offer their customers proprietary data only if it promotes trading and generates sufficient commission revenue. Although the business models may differ, these vendors' pricing discipline is the same: They can simply refuse to purchase any proprietary data product that fails to provide sufficient value. MIAX and other producers of proprietary data products must understand and respond to these varying business models and pricing disciplines in order to market proprietary data products successfully.
In addition to the competition and price discipline described above, the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid, inexpensive, and profitable. The history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers: Archipelago, BATS Trading and Direct Edge. Regulation NMS, by deregulating the market for proprietary data, has increased the contestability of that market. While broker-dealers have previously published their proprietary data individually, Regulation NMS encourages market data vendors and broker-dealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible. Multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale, including Bloomberg, and Thomson Reuters.
The Court in NetCoalition concluded that the Commission had failed to demonstrate that the market for market data was competitive based on the reasoning of the Commission's NetCoalition order because, in the Court's view, the Commission had not adequately demonstrated that the proprietary data at issue in the case is Start Printed Page 21681used to attract order flow. MIAX believes, however, that evidence not then before the court clearly demonstrates that availability of data attracts order flow. Due to competition among platforms, MIAX intends to improve its platform data offerings on a continuing basis, and to respond promptly to customers' data needs.
The intensity of competition for proprietary information is significant and MIAX believes that this proposal itself clearly evidences such competition. MIAX is offering ToM in order to keep pace with changes in the industry and evolving customer needs. It is entirely optional and is geared towards attracting new Member Applicants and customers. MIAX competitors continue to create new market data products and innovative pricing in this space. MIAX expects to see firms challenge its pricing on the basis of MIAX's explicit fees being higher than the zero-priced fees from other competitors such as BATS. In all cases, MIAX expects firms to make decisions on how much and what types of data to consume on the basis of the total cost of interacting with MIAX or other exchanges. Of course, the explicit data fees are only one factor in a total platform analysis. Some competitors have lower transactions fees and higher data fees, and others are vice versa. The market for this proprietary information is highly competitive and continually evolves as products develop and change.
The Exchange notes that the ToM market data and fees will compete with similar products offered by other markets such as NASDAQ OMX PHLX, LLC (“PHLX”) and the International Stock Exchange LLC (“ISE”). For example, PHLX and ISE offer market data products that are similar to ToM: data feeds that show the top of the market entitled Top of PHLX Options (“TOPO”) and the ISE TOP Quote Feed.

Prácticamente todas las firmas de corretaje proveen de una nueva forma de cuenta estándar con una cláusula que requiere que usted persiga cualquier queja a través de procedimientos de arbitraje y no por medio del sistema judicial ante tribunales.P. ¿Cómo funciona el arbitraje?R. El arbitraje es como un juicio, sólo que en lugar de un juez y de un jurado se tiene un panel de uno a tres árbitros que actúan tanto como de jueces como de jurados. Dan audiencia y consideran los argumentos y pruebas de ambas partes del caso, para después pronunciar una decisión obligatoria. Por lo general, entre los árbitros se encuentran por lo menos una persona "de la industria" y otras dos personas. Pueden ser contadores, abogados, agentes comerciales, banqueros, educadores, jueces retirados y otros profesionistas. A diferencia del procedimiento ante tribunales, el arbitraje no suele incluir testimonios, mociones o apelaciones. Por lo general, es mucho más rápido y barato que la corte en lo civil. Su tiempo promedio de duración es de un año desde que se entabla la demanda hasta la primera audiencia, a diferencia de los más de dos años de duración en los tribunales estatales o federales. El arbitraje de valores se explica con detalle en la página web de la Ley de Valores.P. ¿Quién dirige los procedimientos de arbitraje?R. Los tres foros principales para resolver controversias de valores por medio del arbitraje son:La Asociación Americana de Arbitraje.La Casa de Bolsa de Nueva YorkLa Asociación Nacional de Agentes Intermediarios Bursátiles (N.A.S.D., por sus siglas en inglés)Recomendamos este último foro, debido a que es el menos costoso y además se inclina a favor del cliente.P. ¿Cuánto cuesta demandar en un procedimiento de arbitraje?R. Cada foro cobra sus propios honorarios por la presentación de la demanda, la administración y la audiencia. El costo promedio de la presentación de la demanda ante la N.A.S.D es aproximadamente de $1,200. Mientras mayor sea la cantidad de su reclamo, mayor serán sus gastos administrativos y de demanda. Si el caso se resuelve, una parte de los mismos puede ser reembolsada.P. ¿Qué otros gastos se generan?R. A pesar de que la consulta inicial es gratuita, puede ser que existan gastos relacionados con la preparación de la exhibición de daños para la mediación y/o arbitraje. Si el caso no se resuelve (la mayoría sí se resuelven), entonces puede surgir la necesidad de contratar a un testigo experto para que testifique a su nombre. Aunque nosotros somos esencialmente expertos, al ser sus abogados no podemos atestiguar. Hemos contratado los servicios de numerosos expertos reconocidos nacionalmente en la industria de valores. También cobramos por una sola vez "gastos varios" para mensajería, correo, fotocopiado y cualesquiera otros gastos incidentales de Shepherd Smith Edwards & Kantas LTD LLP relacionados con la demanda del cliente. Otros gastos legales se discuten por adelantado.P. ¿Cómo establecen sus honorarios Shepherd Smith Edwards & Kantas LTD LLP?R. Trabajamos bajo honorarios condicionales; si usted no recupera su dinero, no paga gastos legales. Sin embargo, en caso de que sí recupere lo reclamado o parte de lo reclamado, tendrá que pagar a Shepherd Smith Edwards & Kantas LTD LLP un porcentaje de la cantidad recuperada después de deducidos los gastos.P. ¿Cuáles son mis posibilidades de "ganar" un caso?R. Según el Comentarista de Arbitraje de valores, una publicación periódica que ha estudiado las estadísticas de este tipo de casos, el 80% de los casos de los clientes se resuelve a favor del inversionista antes de que se dicte un laudo arbitral. Más de la mitad del 20% restante que no se resuelve antes del arbitraje resulta en una indemnización al cliente. En ningún caso de arbitraje Shepherd Smith Edwards & Kantas LTD LLP puede asegurar que habrá una recuperación. No obstante, nuestra decisión de aceptar un caso se basa en nuestra creencia de que éste tiene mérito y de que una recuperación de dinero está justificada.P. ¿Vale la pena todo el tiempo y el esfuerzo?R. Depende de usted. Tome en cuenta que se le pedirán copias de sus antecedentes financieros y declaraciones fiscales. También deberá responder a otras preguntas sobre sus antecedentes y experiencias. Usted debe decidir si quiere o no que el corredor pague por su conducta y por la manera en que lo trató.Renuncia de responsabilidad: Al proporcionar la información contenida en la página web, Shepherd, Smith & Edwards no acuerda, ni expresa ni tácitamente, proporcionar servicios ni asesorías legales a nadie, a menos que se haya celebrado un contrato entre la firma y el cliente.
