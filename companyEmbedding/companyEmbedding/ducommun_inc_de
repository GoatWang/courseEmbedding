	NEWS RELEASE




	Ducommun Reports Results for the




	Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2016




	Company Begins 2017 Well Positioned for Growth as New CEO Takes Helm




	LOS ANGELES (


	March 6, 2017


	) – Ducommun Incorporated (NYSE:DCO) (“Ducommun” or the “Company”) today reported results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.




	Fourth Quarter 2016 Highlights


















	•






	Fourth quarter revenue was


	$142.5 million


















	•






	Operating income was


	$9.0 million


















	•






	GAAP net income for the quarter was


	$2.8 million


	, or


	$0.25


	 per diluted share
















	•






	Adjusted net income for the quarter was


	$5.1 million


	, or


	$0.45


	 per diluted share, which excludes a $1.2 million final pre-tax net working capital adjustment and a $1.0 million tax adjustment related to divestitures
















	•






	Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was


	$15.1 million


















	•






	Cash flow from operations for the quarter was


	$15.8 million


















	•






	Backlog increased to


	$600 million
















	•






	Net voluntary principal prepayments on credit facilities totaled


	$10 million


	 during the quarter - for a net total of


	$75 million


	 in voluntary principal prepayments during 2016







	“Ducommun again posted improved operating results and excellent cash flow during the quarter, paying down an additional $10 million in debt before year end,” said Stephen G. Oswald, president and chief executive officer. “For 2016 as a whole, we eliminated $75 million of indebtedness, and our backlog rose to $600 million due to recent commercial aerospace awards - leaving us very well positioned for 2017 and beyond.




	“Looking back, the Company took a number of decisive steps in 2016 that streamlined and focused our operations, and I’m excited to lead this innovative organization going forward. In 2017, the higher commercial platform build rates expected later this year, along with the potential for increased defense spending, make me confident we have a strong foundation to leverage our leading position in composites, titanium, and advanced electronics.”




	Fourth Quarter Results




	Net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 was


	$142.5 million


	, compared to


	$156.6 million


	 for the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decline was due to the following:













	•






	$17.5 million lower revenue within the Company’s industrial, medical and other (“Industrial”) end-use markets mainly due to the divestiture of the Pittsburgh operation in January 2016 and closure of the Houston operation in December 2015; and
















	•






	$4.5 million lower revenue within the Company’s military and space end-use markets mainly due to the divestiture of the Miltec operation in March 2016; partially offset by
















	•






	$7.8 million higher revenue in the Company’s commercial aerospace end-use markets mainly due to added content with existing customers.







	Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was


	$2.8 million


	, or


	$0.25


	 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of


	$(65.2) million


	, or


	$(5.88)


	 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter of 2016 included a $1.2 million (pre-tax) net working capital


























	adjustment for which there was no related tax benefit and a $1.0 million tax adjustment related to the finalization of a divestiture. The impact of these two non-recurring items was $2.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share.




	The increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to the following:













	•






	$57.2 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge within the Structural Systems segment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015;
















	•






	$32.9 million non-cash pre-tax charge related to the impairment of an indefinite-lived trade name within the Electronic Systems segment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015; and
















	•






	Improved operating performance in the fourth quarter of 2016; partially offset by
















	•






	$28.0 million higher income tax expense.







	Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was


	$27.8 million


	, or


	19.5%


	 of revenue, compared to gross profit of


	$22.8 million


	, or


	14.6%


	 of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2015. The higher gross margin percentage year-over-year was primarily due to improved product mix (reflecting the aforementioned divestitures), ongoing supply chain initiatives, and improved operating performance.




	Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was


	$9.0 million


	, or


	6.3%


	 of revenue, compared to an operating loss of


	$(88.6) million


	, or


	(56.6)%


	 of revenue, for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to the items that affected operating income (loss) described in net income (loss) above.




	Interest expense decreased slightly to


	$2.0 million


	 in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to


	$2.2 million


	 in the previous year’s fourth quarter, primarily due to a lower outstanding debt balance as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the Company’s credit facilities.




	Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 was


	$15.1 million


	, or


	10.6%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$11.0 million


	, or


	7.1%


	 of revenue, for the comparable period in 2015.




	During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company generated


	$15.8 million


	 of cash from operations, compared to


	$11.6 million


	 during the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to the higher net income.




	Business Segment Information




	Structural Systems




	Structural Systems reported net revenue for the current quarter of


	$60.8 million


	, compared to


	$61.0 million


	 for the fourth quarter of 2015. The slight decrease year-over-year was primarily due to a $2.9 million decline in military and space revenue, reflecting program delays and budget changes which impacted scheduled deliveries on the Company’s fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. This decline was partially offset by a $2.8 million increase in the Company’s commercial aerospace revenue, mainly due to added content with existing customers.




	Structural Systems reported operating income for the current fourth quarter of


	$3.2 million


	, or


	5.2%


	 of revenue, compared to an operating loss of


	$(56.0) million


	, or


	(91.8)%


	 of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the fact that the prior year quarter included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $57.2 million and the current year period benefited from higher operating margins.




	Adjusted EBITDA was


	$5.2 million


	 for the current quarter, or


	8.5%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$4.6 million


	, or


	7.6%


	 of revenue, for the comparable quarter in 2015.




	Electronic Systems




	Electronic Systems reported net revenue for the current quarter of


	$81.7 million


	, compared to


	$95.6 million


	 for the fourth quarter of 2015. The lower net revenue year-over-year was primarily due to the following:













	•






	$17.5 million decrease in Industrial revenue mainly due to the divestiture of the Company’s Pittsburgh operation in January 2016 and closure of the Houston operation in December 2015; and
















	•






	$1.5 million decrease in military and space revenue mainly due to the divestiture of the Company’s Miltec operation in March 2016; partially offset by
















	•






	$5.1 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue mainly due to added content with the Company’s existing customers.





























	Electronic Systems operating income for the current year fourth quarter was


	$9.2 million


	, or


	11.3%


	 of revenue, compared to an operating loss of


	$(27.0) million


	, or


	(28.3)%


	 of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in operating income year-over-year was primarily due to the following:













	•






	Fourth quarter 2015 included a non-cash charge related to the impairment of the indefinite-lived trade name intangible asset of $32.9 million; and
















	•






	Higher operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the aforementioned divestitures and improved operating performance.







	Adjusted EBITDA was


	$12.8 million


	 for the current quarter, or


	15.7%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$11.3 million


	, or


	11.8%


	 of revenue, in the comparable quarter in 2015.




	Corporate General and Administrative (“CG&A”) Expense




	CG&A expense for the current fourth quarter was


	$3.4 million


	, or


	2.4%


	 of total Company revenue, compared to


	$5.6 million


	, or


	3.6%


	 of total Company revenue, in the comparable quarter in 2015. The decrease in CG&A expense in the current year quarter was primarily due to lower professional fees of $1.7 million and lower compensation and benefit costs of $0.5 million.

	NEWS RELEASE









	Ducommun Reports Results for the




	First Quarter Ended


	April 1, 2017






	Strong Cash Flow; Company on Track for Another Solid Year




	LOS ANGELES (


	May 4, 2017


	) – Ducommun Incorporated (NYSE:DCO) (“Ducommun” or the “Company”) today reported results for its first quarter ended


	April 1, 2017


	.




	First Quarter 2017 Highlights













	•






	Revenue was


	$136.3 million
















	•






	Net income was


	$2.1 million


	, or


	$0.18


	 per diluted share
















	•






	Adjusted EBITDA was


	$11.7 million
















	•






	Cash flow from operations was


	$13.2 million
















	•






	Net voluntary principal prepayments on credit facilities totaled $5 million







	“Ducommun’s first quarter results reflect the demand dynamics of our various end-use markets at the start of what we expect to be a solid year ahead,” said Stephen G. Oswald, president and chief executive officer. “Net of divestitures, revenue was up slightly year-over-year, benefiting from an increase in defense shipments and solid sales across several large commercial platforms. We also paid down an additional $5 million of debt, more than doubled capital expenditures, after generating $13.2 million in cash from operations during the quarter.




	“Even as we’ve accomplished a great deal these past twelve months - resulting in a more focused organization and improved cost structure - we see room for higher operating performance going forward. As I begin my new role, we are assessing all areas of the Company for new ways to streamline manufacturing, further increase margins, and enhance return on capital. This is a priority heading into the second half, and we have already hired select staff to focus on initiatives that will bolster Ducommun’s growth trajectory and strengthen bottom line results. For example, we have filled a new role in the Company to lead strategic initiatives that will drive inorganic growth and a higher level of strategic thinking. We are setting the stage to take the Company to the next level --  leveraging our people, technology expertise and the current attractive economic environment.”




	First Quarter Results




	Net revenue for the first quarter of


	2017


	 was


	$136.3 million


	 compared to


	$142.1 million


	 for the first quarter of


	2016


	. The net revenue decrease year-over-year was primarily due to the following:













	•






	$6.0 million lower revenue within the Company’s commercial aerospace end-use markets mainly due to the winding down of a regional jet program and the platform transition of a large aircraft program; and
















	•






	$5.8 million lower revenue within the Company’s industrial end-use markets mainly due to the closure of one of the Company’s Tulsa operations in June 2016 and divestiture of the Company’s Pittsburgh operation in January 2016; partially offset by
















	•






	$5.9 million higher revenue within the Company’s military and space end-use markets mainly due to the resumption of scheduled deliveries by the U.S. Department of Defense, which favorably impacted the Company’s helicopter and fixed-wing platforms, partially offset by the divestiture of the Company’s Miltec operation in March 2016.







	Net income for the first quarter of


	2017


	 was


	$2.1 million


	, or


	$0.18


	 per diluted share, compared to


	$13.6 million


	, or


	$1.21


	 per diluted share, for the first quarter of


	2016


	. The decrease in net income year-over-year was primarily due to the following:



































	•






	The prior year included a preliminary pretax gain on divestitures of the Company’s Pittsburgh and Miltec operations of $18.8 million; partially offset by
















	•






	$6.8 million of lower income tax expense.







	Gross profit for the first quarter of


	2017


	 was


	$24.9 million


	, or


	18.3%


	 of revenue, compared to gross profit of


	$27.0 million


	, or


	19.0%


	 of revenue, for the first quarter of


	2016


	. The decrease in gross margin percentage year-over-year was primarily due to unfavorable product mix.




	Operating income for the first quarter of


	2017


	 was


	$4.1 million


	, or


	3.0%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$4.3 million


	, or


	3.0%


	 of revenue, in the comparable period last year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the following:













	•






	Decrease in gross margin percentage as a result of unfavorable product mix; partially offset by
















	•






	Lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the divestiture of the Company’s Pittsburgh operation and closure of certain facilities.







	Interest expense decreased to


	$1.6 million


	 in the first quarter of


	2017


	, compared to


	$2.4 million


	 in the previous year’s first quarter, primarily due to a lower outstanding debt balance as a result of net voluntary principal prepayments on the Company’s credit facilities.




	Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of


	2017


	 was


	$11.7 million


	, or


	8.6%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$11.1 million


	, or


	7.8%


	 of revenue, for the comparable period in 2016.




	During the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated


	$13.2 million


	 of cash from operations compared to


	$5.5 million


	 during the first quarter of 2016. The increase in cash flow from operations reflects a reduction in accounts receivable and higher deferred income taxes.




	The Company’s firm backlog as of April 1, 2017 was


	$581 million


	 compared to $600 million as of December 31, 2016, reflecting a $7 million decrease in the Company’s commercial aerospace backlog and a $13 million decrease in its military and space backlog, both due to timing of orders.




	Structural Systems




	Structural Systems segment net revenue for the current-year first quarter was


	$57.6 million


	, compared to


	$64.0 million


	 for the first quarter of


	2016


	. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $7.2 million decline in commercial aerospace shipments as a result of the winding down of a regional jet program as well as the platform transition of a large aircraft program.




	Structural Systems segment operating income for the current-year first quarter was


	$2.6 million


	, or


	4.6%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$2.7 million


	, or


	4.3%


	 of revenue, for the first quarter of


	2016


	.




	Structural Systems segment Adjusted EBITDA was


	$5.0 million


	 for the current-year quarter, or


	8.7%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$4.8 million


	, or


	7.5%


	 of revenue, for the comparable quarter in the prior year.




	Electronic Systems




	Electronic Systems segment net revenue for the current-year first quarter was


	$78.7 million


	, compared to


	$78.1 million


	 for the first quarter of


	2016


	. The increase in revenue year-over-year was primarily due to the following:













	•






	$5.2 million higher revenue within the Company’s military and space end-use markets mainly due to the resumption of scheduled deliveries by the U.S. Department of Defense, which favorably impacted the Company’s fixed-wing and helicopter platforms, partially offset by the divestiture of the Company’s Miltec operation in March 2016; and
















	•






	$1.2 million higher revenue within the Company’s commercial aerospace end-use markets mainly due to additional content with the Company’s existing customers; partially offset by
















	•






	$5.8 million lower revenue in the Company’s industrial end-use markets mainly due to the closure of one of the Company’s Tulsa operations in June 2016 and the divestiture of the Company’s Pittsburgh operation in January 2016.







	Electronic Systems’ segment operating income was


	$7.1 million


	, or


	9.0%


	 of revenue, for the first quarter of 2017 compared to


	$6.4 million


	, or


	8.2%


	 of revenue, for the comparable quarter in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the divestiture of the Company’s Pittsburgh operation and closure of certain facilities.


























	Electronic Systems segment Adjusted EBITDA was


	$10.5 million


	 for the quarter, or


	13.4%


	 of revenue, compared to


	$10.1 million


	, or


	13.0%


	 of revenue, for the comparable quarter in the prior year.




	Corporate General and Administrative (“CG&A”) Expenses




	CG&A expenses for the first quarter of


	2017


	 were


	$5.6 million


	, or


	4.1%


	 of total Company revenue, compared to


	$4.8 million


	, or


	3.4%


	 of total Company revenue, for the comparable quarter in the prior year. The increase in CG&A expenses was primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of $1.1 million, partially offset by lower professional services fees.

Ducommun Incorporated serves the global aerospace industry by manufacturing structural and electronic components and assemblies for commercial and military aircrafts, and by providing engineering services for missile and space programs. 

 Business Overview
Ducommun Inc. started with a store that was opened by Charles Ducommun in Los Angeles during the California Gold rush. From providing aircraft aluminum to Lockheed, the company helped assist the birth of  the aerospace industry. Ducommun is the oldest company in California, as it was found in 1849. It was initially incorporated in California in 1907, but it was reincorporated in Delaware in 1970 for tax purposes.

 Industry Analysis
 Porter's Five Forces
 Threat of Entry
Low: Entering the Aerospace and Defense services industry requires a substantial amount of capital requirements. Ducommun's main reason for success has been its historical record of over 160 years. For example,  Ducommun occupies approximately 21 facilities with a total office and manufacturing area of over 1,458,000 square feet, including both owned and leased properties. [1] A start up company would require exceptional amount of human and financial capital to even considering opening a single manufacturing facility. Ducommun also prides itself on its strong brand identity. It is very hard for a start up company to build that reputation and gain the respect by its customers, suppliers, and competitors.

 Competitive Rivalry
High: The aerospace and defense industry is highly competitive, and the products and services are affected by varying degrees of competition. Ducommun's direct competitors focus on offering the same services such as manufacturing aerostructure components or electromechanical components. On the other hand, Ducommun has competitors worldwide, some of which are much larger with respect to resources available to them. They have greater financial, technical, and personnel advantages than what Ducommun operates with. These larger competitors also offer a wider variety of products and service. This can be a problem for Ducommun due to the competitor's ability to offer customers bundled products.

 Threat of Substitutes
Med: Products offered by Ducommun to the commercial and military markets are also offered by other competitors. However, Ducommun is a proven leader in terms of quality with the products that it sells. The company has right to various patents that allow it to maintain its competitive advantage on its products.  DAS has some of the largest and most sophisticated stretch-forming presses in the United States. These patented processes allow DAS to form the aerostructural components at a higher quality than the available substitutes. 

 Blue Chip Customers
 Bargaining power of suppliers
Low: Ducommun is not materially dependent upon any individual raw-material supplier.  A majority of the products are obtained on the open-markets domestically and internationally. Therefore, no supplier offers a unique enough product for Ducommun to rely on. 

 Bargaining power of customers
High: Boeing Company (BA), Raytheon, and United Technologies (UTX)  accounted for 46% of the companies total revenues in 2010. During 2010, sales to Boeing were $107,466,000, or approximately 26% of total sales; sales to Raytheon were $48,198,000, or approximately 12% of total sales; sales to the United Technologies were $30,680,000, or approximately 8% of total sales.[1] The fact that just under half of the overall revenues come from three companies, these customers have a large influence on the operations of DuCommun.

 Competitors

 Business Analysis
 Marketing
 Product
DAS


Stretch-Forming, Hot-Forming and Machining

DAS supplies its target industry with engineering and manufacturing of complex components using stretch-forming and hot-forming processes and computer-based machining. Stretch-forming is a process for manufacturing complex structural shapes primarily from aluminum sheet metal extrusions.  Hot-forming is a metal working process conducted at high temperature for manufacturing close-tolerance titanium and aluminum components. [4]

Composites and Metal Bonding

DAS produces helicopter main and tail rotor blades, and adhesive bonded assemblies, including winglets, spoilers, and fuselage structural panels for aircraft.

Chemical Milling

Chemical milling is used to remove materials in specific areas to reduce weights in regions where full thickness in materials is not required. Some of the products that use this type of milling are jet engine components, wing leading edges, and fuselage skins.
[5]
DTI

Panels and Switches

DTI offers manufactures illuminated switches, switch assemblies, keyboard panels, edge lit panels, microwave and millimeterwave switches. 

Mechanical and Electromechanical Subassemblies

DTI's products include sophisticated radar enclosures, gyroscopes and indicators, aircraft avionics racks, and shipboard communications and control enclosures.

Engineering, Technical and Program Management Services

These services are offered principally for advanced weapons systems and missile defense primarily for United States defense, space and homeland security programs. [1]

 Price
As with many other aerospace services companies in the industry, Ducommun will rarely, if ever, market any of their products based on price. It would be quite uncommon for any firm in this industry to market their products with a low price strategy as means to attract new customers. Ducommun makes multiyear firm, fixed-price commitments to its customers.[1] However, without assurance to the company's anticipated production costs, the company faces a risk of experiencing negative losses.

 Place
Ducommun provides its products and services both domestically in the United States, and internationally. The Company has manufacturing facilities in Thailand and Mexico. In 2010, sales to foreign customers worldwide were $37,970,000, or 3% of total revenues. [1]

 Promotion
In respect of the current customers, Ducommun promotes its products through its reputation of superior quality products.  In order to attract new contracts, Ducommun relies on presentations at  aerospace and defense conferences. However, the marketing for companies in this industry is a very difficult area to measure. The data provided in the 2010 annual report did not provide much information to give more insight for a better understanding of Ducommun marketing techniques.

 Supply Chain
The Ducommun supply chain team works with the global supply base to ensure the highest level of performance in the areas of quality, cost, delivery, and service. Ducommun continues to develop mutually benefit supplier relationships resulting in positive growth for all members of the supply chain. Cost reductions are being accomplished through commodity management and resulting in an increase of long term agreements and supplier alliances.

 Human Resources
Ducommun's success is powered by the development and full commitment of its employees. At the end of 2010, the company reported a total of 1,815 employees. [6]

 Ducommun acquisitions in the past five years[1]
 Acquisitions
Ducommun has deployed more than $110 million in the last five years, completing multiple strategic acquisitions.

Dynabill Industries is a leading provider of titanium and aluminum structural components and assemblies for commercial and military aerospace applications. The company was acquired for $45,386,000.

CMP Display System was bought by Ducommun for $13,804,000. CMP manufactures incandescent, electroluminescent and LED edge lit panels and assemblies for the aerospace and defense industries. 

Wisewave is a manufacturer of microwave and millimeterwave products for both aerospace and non-aerospace applications. The price of the transaction to Ducommun was $6,827,000. 

Miltec provides its services through engineering, technical and program management. This includes design, development, integration and test of prototype product, mainly for the aerospace and military segment. This company was bought for $46,811,000.[1]

 Strategy Analysis
 Strengths
Patented processes and technical superiority
The company has several patents that allow their products to be of top quality. Despite having a wide array of patents, Ducommun does not believe that its operations are dependent on any single patent or group of patents. Rather, the company prides itself on its technical superiority, continual product improvement, exclusive product features, superior lead time, on-time delivery performance, quality and customer relationships to maintain its competitive advantage.

 2012 Growth Initiative
Strong order backlog
The order backlog is the value of the orders that a manufacturer has signed but not completed and been paid for yet. At the end of 2010, backlog was approximately $328,045,000, compared to $367,138,000 at the end of 2009. This value of unfilled orders assures the company a steady stream of revenues in the future years despite any occurrences of unusual events.[9]
Focus on organic and inorganic growth
The company follows its operations to be in line with its strategic long term goals. The company had revenues of $408 million in 2010. Ducommun currently has a growth initiative to raise this revenue level to the $1 billion mark by the end of 2012. [10] It plans to achieve this through a combination of organic and inorganic growth.  Organic growth is the growth rate that a company can achieve by increasing output and enhancing sales with the current resources it has. On the other hand, inorganic growth is growth in the operations of a business that arises from mergers or takeovers, rather than an increase in the companies own business activity.

 Weaknesses
High reliance on defense spending by military/space products
In 2010 approximately 60% of sales were derived from military and space markets. These markets largely depend on government spending, particularly the United States government. Despite  forecasts of increasing defense spending, forecasts are just forecasts.
High dependence on Boeing, Raytheon, and United Technologies
In 2010, Ducommun sales were approximately 26% for Boeing aircraft programs, 12% for Raytheon military aircraft programs and 8% for United Technologies, specifically the  Sikorsky Blackhawk helicopter program. [1] With just under 50% of the entire revenues coming from three companies, Ducommun loses a lot of supplier power to these companies. 
Losses on fixed-price contracts
Ducommun sells many of its products under fixed-price contracts. This means that the company would be receiving a set revenue for the contract despite the costs incurred by the company. As a result, if any manufacturing inefficiencies, start-up costs, or other factors cause an increase in production costs, Ducommun is very susceptible to experiencing losses.


 Opportunities
Rising global defense spending
The United States remains the global leader in defense spending, surpassing the next closest country by more than eight times. The global financial and economic crisis has resulted in many nations cutting back on all sorts of public spending , and yet military spending seems to be increasing. [11]
Growing demand of commercial airplanes
The growth in commercial airplane market is be $2.8 trillion by 2027. By that year , the commercial airplane fleet globally is expected increase to twice the size as compared to the current fleet size. It is forecasted that the passenger traffic would grow at around 5% annually till 2027, requiring approximately 28,600 additional commercial airplanes to meet the rising traffic. The Asia-Pacific region is projected to be the largest market, making up 36% of the $2.8 trillion market. North America is second with 26% of the market share. [12]

 Threats
Consolidation in the Aerospace Industry
The industry that Ducommun operates in is experiencing significant consolidation. This includes the company's suppliers, customers, and competitors. If the suppliers face consolidation, Ducommun faces the threat of fewer resources of supply and/or higher costs. Consolidation in the customers has the potential to result in delays in the time Ducommun takes to receive a contract award or the loss of existing/potential customers. Consolidation in the competitors may create competitors with higher resources and therefore cause a loss in the company's market share.

 Financial Analysis
 General

[13]
Ducommon is on the smaller end when compared in market capitalization to the industry. However, it is very similar to its two competitors, LMIA and ATRO. Looking at the Beta, the average of DCO and its competitors is a little below 1.5, showing very a higher than usual sensitivity to the market conditions. One thing to note from the above comparable is that DCO has a large number of employees compared to LMIA and ATRO, which are similar market cap companies.

 Valuation

[13]
Due the Ducommun’s positive earnings, P/E Price to Book, and EV/EBITDA ratios are the most appropriate valuation measures. The Price to Sales ratio is less informative than the PE since the company has positive earnings. Comparing DCO to its competitors and the industry, we see that the company is undervalued in all measures. This can be a good sign showing that the company is expected by the financial markets to record high earnings and sales, and eventually increase its book value.

 Growth and Profitability

[13]

Error creating thumbnail  DCO Revenue vs. Net Income 2001-2010[13]
The company’s margin percentages are slightly lower when compared to the industry and competitor averages. A point to note from the image on the right is that the company had a compound annual growth rate of 6.3% in the past 10 years. 2010 was the first time in 6 years where the revenue had a negative growth. However, on a more positive note, DCO grew earnings in the face of decreased revenues over the past twelve months. This is a trend that is not sustainable if profits are to continue to decrease at this rate.  However, this result was better than that of the average company in the Aerospace & Defense industry.

 Financial Strength

[13]
DCO uses little debt in its capital structure. At a total debt/total capital ratio of 1.27%, the company is substantially less exposed to debt compared to the competitors and industry. It has been also decreasing its debt quarter over quarter at a faster rate than the industry. Overall,  DCO has less financial risk than the industry aggregate. DCO also has very good liquidity ratios. With a quick ratio of 1.25 and an interest coverage of 38.53, the company should be able to comfortably pay back any short term obligations.

 Management Effectiveness

[13]
DCO is doing an acceptable job in comparison to its peers with a return on assets  and return on investment of 5.66% and 7.21% respectively. Despite average performance at managing their resources, the company is below average at generating revenues from employees and  managing their owner's equity compared to other companies in the Aerospace & Defense industry. DCO has a ROE of 8.12% compared to the industry average of 18.4%. Revenue per employee at DCO equals $225,017.10, much below the $316,538.27 average of the industry. Overall, DCO is not managing its resources as effectively as its competitors and the industry as a whole.
