In Major Reversal, Trump Says China ‘Not Currency Manipulators’

 President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he no longer believes China manipulates its currency, a complete shift from the position he repeatedly took during his 2016 campaign. 
 “They’re not currency manipulators,” Trump told the the Wall Street Journal during an Oval Office interview. 
 The reason he changed his mind, the president said, was because China has stopped manipulating its currency in recent months and the accusations could jeopardize U.S. negotiations with China to deal with the nuclear threat from North Korea. 

Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 


their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?  I don't think so!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016 

 Trump's flip flop comes just days after the president hosted his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at Mar-a-Lago in southern Florida. 
 Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would instruct his Treasury Secretary to label China “a currency manipulator.” And as recently as 10 days ago, he told the Financial Times that China was the "world champion" of currency manipulators. 
 The official label would need to be included in a semiannual Treasury report expected this month.

 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a longtime critic of how the Chinese government values its currency, released a statement saying Trump is giving China “a green light to steal our jobs and wealth time and time again.” 
 “The best way to get China to cooperate with North Korea, is to be tough on them with trade, which is the number one thing China’s government cares about,” Schumer said.

 Trump also signaled in the interview with the Journal that he may be willing to change his position on re-nominating Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen next year. 
 Trump had accused Yellen of keeping interest rates low for political reasons under President Barack Obama. But on Wednesday he said he likes a low-interest rate policy. 
 “I think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that’s my fault because people have confidence in me. But that’s hurting — that will hurt, ultimately,” Trump said. 
 He said Yellen was “not toast” and he would consider renominating her next year.

TRUMP: We're going to 'cut regulations by 75%' and impose a 'very major border tax'

President Donald Trump
  meeting with top American CEOs.

  President Donald Trump said in a meeting with CEOs on Monday that
  his administration would prioritize tax cuts for corporations and
  decreasing regulation in its first days.


  Trump, speaking with CEOs including Kevin Plank of Under Armour,
  Elon Musk of Tesla, and Mark Fields of Ford, promised to "cut
  regulations by 75%, maybe more." Trump said regulations regarding
  worker safety would be "just as strong" and "just as protective
  of the people," but that current regulations "make it impossible
  to get anything built."


  It is unclear whether Trump is seeking to cut the cost of
  regulations or their total number.


  Trump also reiterated threats to impose a significant "border
  tax" on companies that move production outside of the US to other
  countries.


  "If you go to another country and you decide that you're going to
  close and get rid of 2,000 people or 5,000 people ... we are
  going to be imposing a very major border tax on the product when
  it comes in," Trump said.


  The move on trade also comes as Trump is 
  expected to sign an executive order that would renegotiate
  the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and pull the
  US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.


  He also reiterated a campaign promise to cut corporate taxes —
  and taxes for the middle class overall.


  "We're going to be cutting taxes massively for both the middle
  class and for companies, and that's massively," Trump said.
  "We're trying to get it down to anywhere from 15 to 20%, and it's
  now 35%, but it's probably more 38% than it is 35%."


  The current federal corporate tax rate is 35%, and it averages
  39% for companies when state taxes are added.


  The goal, according to Trump, is to "bring back manufacturing to
  our country." He said there would be breaks for companies that
  create products in the US.


  "There will be advantages to companies that do indeed make their
  products here," Trump said.


  Trump also said he plans to hold meetings with the CEOs on a
  quarterly basis or whenever they want to in order to address
  their concerns.


  Following the meeting, the business leaders
  appeared outside of the White House with Andrew
  Liveris, CEO of Dow Chemical, speaking to reporters. Liveris
  said Trump was "engaged" in the meeting and also addressed
  concerns over a border tax.


  "We did talk about the border tax quite a bit and we did talk
  about the sort of industries that might be helped or hurt by
  that," said Liveris. "Look, I would take the president at his
  word here, he's not going to do anything to harm competitiveness,
  he's actually going to make us all more competitive."


  Liveris also said that the business leaders were going to come
  back in 30 days with a plan to help to US manufacturing
  sector. 


  Here is the full list of executives present for the meeting:


Michael Dell, Dell Technologies
  
Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool
  
Mark Fields, Ford
  
Alex Gorsky, Johnson & Johnson
  
Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin
  
Klaus Kleinfeld, Arconic
  
Andrew Liveris, Dow Chemical
  
Mario Longhi, US Steel
  
Elon Musk, SpaceX and Tesla
  
Kevin Plank, Under Armour
  
Mark Sutton, International Paper
  
Wendell Weeks, Corning
