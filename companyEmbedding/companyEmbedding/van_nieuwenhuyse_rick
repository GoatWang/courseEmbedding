Published on Oct 26, 2015Taped October 8, 2015 in Vancouver, CanadaNovaCopper's principal assets, the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (UKMP), are located in the highly prospective Ambler Mining District in Alaska which is home to some of the world's richest known copper-dominant polymetallic deposits.Mineralization in the UKMP area is characterized by two discrete mineralized belts: the Devonian Ambler Schist Belt and the Devonian Bornite carbonate sequence. The Ambler Schist Belt is host to a series of polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits including the Arctic deposit and several other known VMS deposits. At Bornite, copper mineralization is hosted in Devonian clastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks lying immediately south of the Ambler Schist Belt across the Ambler lowlands. The trend of the mineralized district extends for approximately 60 miles along strike. http://www.novacopper.com CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:This presentation includes certain Forward-Looking Statements and Forward-Looking Information (collectively, “forward-looking statements”) within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included herein including, without limitation, statements relating to program objectives and future plans for the project, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are frequently, but not always, identified by words such as “expects”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “intends”, “estimates”, “potential”, “possible” and similar expressions, or statements that events, conditions or results “will”, “may”, “could”, or “should” occur or be achieved. These forward-looking statements are set forth principally under the slides pertaining to the Arctic preliminary economic assessment titled “Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Arctic Project, Ambler Mining District, Northwest Alaska” dated effective September 12, 2013 (the Arctic PEA)permitting process and timeline for the Ambler access road, future milestones, and elsewhere in this presentation, and may include statements regarding perceived merit of properties; exploration results and budgets; mineral reserves and resource estimates; work programs; capital expenditures; timelines; strategic plans; completion of transactions; market price of precious base metals; or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from NovaCopper’s expectations include the uncertainties involving the need for additional financing to explore and develop properties and availability of financing in the debt and capital markets; uncertainties involved in the interpretation of drilling results and geological tests and the estimation of resources; the need for cooperation of government agencies and native groups in the development and operation of properties; the need to obtain permits and governmental approvals; risks of mining projects such as accidents, equipment breakdowns, bad weather, non-compliance with environmental and permit requirements, unanticipated variation in geological structures, ore grades or recovery rates; unexpected cost increases; fluctuations in metal prices and currency exchange rates; and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in NovaCopper’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2014 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and in other NovaCopper’s reports and documents filed with applicable securities regulatory authorities from time to time. Forward-looking statements reflect the beliefs, opinions and projections of management on the date the statements are made and are based on various assumptions, such as that permits required for NovaCopper’s operations will be obtained on a timely basis in order to permit NovaCopper to proceed on schedule with its planned exploration and development programs, that skilled personnel and contractors will be available as NovaCopper’s operations continue to grow, that that price of copper and other metals will be at levels that render NovaCopper’s mineral projects economic, that NovaCopper will be able to continue raising the necessary capital to finance its operations and realize on mineral resource estimates, and that the assumptions contained in the Arctic PEA, as defined below, are accurate and complete. NovaCopper assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements of beliefs, opinions, projections, or other factors, should they change, except as required by law.

Vol. 20, No. 7 Week of February 15, 2015
Providing coverage of Alaska and Northwest Canada's mineral industry




Mining News: Arctic feasibilityNovaCopper plans nearly $10M in exploration for 2015 that includes new resource drilling at VMS deposit; budget for Ambler Road seen as modestShane LasleyMining NewsNovaCopper Inc. plans to invest roughly US$20 million over the next two to three years on finalizing a feasibility study for its Arctic deposit, the next step toward the exploration companys vision of developing mines at the world-class copper projects found in the Ambler Mining District of Northwest Alaska.
Arctic is the most advanced of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, a venture formed by NovaCopper and NANA Corp., the Alaska Native regional corporation that represents the Ińupiat of Northwest Alaska. This partnership brought together the Arctic deposit and dozens of similar volcanogenic massive sulfide prospects located on NovaCoppers public and private mining claims with Bornite and a number of other mineral prospects on NANA-owned lands.
Located a mere 16 miles apart, Arctic and Bornite are each considered world-class copper assets that would have long since been developed if not for their remote location, some 200 miles off the beaten path in Northwest Alaska. It is believed that advancing these deposits in tandem will improve the economics of both.
Since formation of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects at the end of 2011, NovaCopper has expanded Bornite to 6 billion pounds of copper in a (March 2014) resource averaging roughly 1.5 percent copper. 
In less than three years, our exploration team has increased six-fold the scale of the Bornite deposit. When combined with our high-grade potentially open-pit resource at Arctic, we have nearly achieved our initial objective of defining approximately 10 billion pounds of copper-equivalent resources in the (Ambler) district, NovaCopper President and CEO Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse said in releasing the latest Bornite resource estimate last March.
With Bornite showing its world-class potential, NovaCopper is now focused on finishing what it started at Arctic.
We see Arctic as the first mine to be developed and Bornite as the second; and we will work on the synergies between the two projects, Van Nieuwenhuyse told Mining News.

Arctic feasibilityArctic was originally envisioned to be developed as an underground mine. This plan, however, was predicated on the idea that the VMS deposit would be developed as a standalone operation; once a part of the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, however, the idea of open-pit mining this copper-rich deposit began to emerge.
The viability of such an operation was affirmed in a preliminary economic assessment completed in 2013.
Over a 12-year mine-life outlined in the PEA, a 10,000-metric-ton-per-day mill at Arctic is anticipated to produce 1.5 million pounds of copper, 1.8 million lbs. of zinc, 289,000 lbs., of lead, 30.5 million oz of silver and 349,000 oz of gold.
Initial capital to build a mine at Arctic is estimated to be US$717.7 million. Another US$164.4 million in sustaining capital and US$81.6 million in closing costs also are anticipated.
The base-case scenario for the PEA uses long-term metal prices of US$2.90/lb. for copper, US85 cents/lb. for zinc, US90 cents/lb. for lead, US$22.70/oz for silver and US$1,300/oz for gold.
Using these price assumptions, the mine would produce roughly 125 million lbs. of copper per year at US62 cents per lb., with the other metals calculated as a by-product.
As a result, this scoping level study finds that the open-pit mining scenario at Arctic would produce an after-tax net present value (8.0 percent discount) of US$537.2 million; an after-tax internal rate of return of 17.9 percent; and would pay back the capital expenses in about five years.
NovaCopper plans to refine and potentially improve the project economics as it completes a feasibility study for Arctic, scheduled for completion as early as 2016.
To finish this study, NovaCopper intends to carry out an US$8- to US$10-million program at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects in 2015. This work, which is currently slated to begin by June, will focus primarily on infill drilling aimed at upgrading inferred resources in the proposed Arctic open-pit from to the measured and indicated categories. 
The open-pit for Arctic encompasses an indicated resource of 23.85 million metric tons averaging 3.26 percent (1.71 billion lbs.) copper, 4.45 percent (2.34 billion lbs.) zinc, 0.76 percent (400 million lbs.) lead, 0.71 grams per metric ton (550,000 oz) gold, and 53.2 g/t (40.8 million oz) silver. Additionally, Arctic has an inferred resource of 3.63 million metric tons averaging 3.22 percent (239 million lbs.) copper, 3.84 percent (285 million lbs.) zinc, 0.58 percent (43.2 million lbs.) lead, 0.59 g/t (60,000 oz) gold.
According to the PEA, it will only take about 4,400 meters of drilling to upgrade the inferred resources to measured and indicated. Another roughly 4,000 meters is needed to gather the geotechnical, hydrological and metallurgical data needed to complete the feasibility study.
NovaCopper, which ended its 2014 fiscal year (Nov. 30) with US$4.8 million in working capital, will need to raise additional funds to complete all of the drilling and other programs on the docket for 2015.
Van Nieuwenhuyse says it would be more efficient to complete all of this work in one field-season, but realizes that it could be tough to raise the required funds in the current markets. Depending on whether it takes one or two field seasons to complete the majority of this work, NovaCopper anticipates the feasibility study to be completed in 2016 or 2017.

Bornite synergyWhile the 2015 program will primarily focus on advancing Arctic to a project that can be presented to banks and permitting agencies, NovaCopper intends to continue to investigate the viability of mining Bornite, which has been the primary focus of NovaCoppers exploration since the 2012 season.
We will continue to work on Bornite but probably at a little slower pace, Van Nieuwenhuyse said.
The potentially open-pittable portion of the project contains indicated resources of 14.1 million metric tons grading 1.08 percent (334 million pounds) copper and inferred resources of 109.6 million metric tons grading 0.94 percent (2.3 billion pounds) copper; and the deeper, potentially underground minable portion of Bornite contains inferred resources of 55.6 million metric tons grading 2.8 percent (3.4 billion pounds) copper.
While NovaCopper did not complete any new drilling at Bornite in 2014, crews re-logged and re-sampled roughly 13,000 meters of core from 37 holes drilled by Kennecott Copper Co. between 1957 and 1976.
During its tenure at Bornite, Kennecott was focused on the highest grade components of the deposit and overlooked lower grade mineralization. For NovaCopper, these lower grade portions of the deposit could potentially convert to reserves in an open-pit mining scenario for Bornite. 
To find the overlooked copper-bearing portions of the deposit, NovaCopper sampled 11,149 meters of untested core. This exercise identified five historical holes with grades topping 0.5 percent copper and another 22 with intercepts of more than 0.2 percent copper.
The program also re-affirmed results from Kennecotts previous assay work by re-sampling 1,503 meters of core already tested by its predecessor at Bornite. 
Previous work by Kennecott, which focused on the narrow high-grade copper intervals, has been confirmed by NovaCopper, Van Nieuwenhuyse said upon release of the assay results in October. This years program serves as an excellent quality control tool in relation to the historic results, and also builds upon the 2012 and 2013 re-logging and re-sampling campaigns to improve resource continuity by addressing zero grade gaps in the resource model. We expect this updated data set to form the basis for determining the ultimate pit configuration and design at Bornite.
If NovaCopper raises sufficient funds, the company would like to drill about five additional holes at Bornite this year.
NovaCopper is tentatively planning to complete a PEA of Bornite in 2016, a scoping level study that will assist the evaluation of synergies with Arctic and mark the first engineering step toward developing what would become the second high-grade copper deposit in the Ambler district.

Ambler RoadThe viability of developing Arctic and Bornite rests largely on establishing a transportation corridor between the Ambler Mining District and Alaskas road system, located some 200 miles to the east.
The state of Alaska began studies on the potential of building a road to the Ambler District in 2009. These studies, initially carried out by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, were transferred to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, in 2013.
AIDEA, which is well-suited to arrange public-private partnerships, entered into a memorandum of understanding with NovaCopper. This agreement paves the way for the quasi-state-owned authority to investigate various ways to fund the construction and maintenance of the Ambler Road and create the framework by which NovaCopper will repay the investment from mines developed at the roads terminus.
In April 2014, AIDEA was given the go-ahead by its board of directors to begin the permitting process for the Ambler Road and to engage a firm to prepare the environmental impact statement for the project under the direction of the federal agencies. The authority is now seeking direction from Alaska lawmakers.
Alaskas new Gov. Bill Walker, however, included no additional funding for the Ambler Road in the budget he recently submitted to the state Legislature.
AIDEA, which has money set aside for the project, does not need funding during the states current budget cycle. The authority, however, will need roughly US$6.8 million to finish an environmental impact statement and associated permits during the next two years.
AIDEA has asked the governor and legislators if it should proceed with permitting in 2015, delay the project or scrap it all together. The authority reasons that the state risks losing money already invested, along with jobs and other economic benefits that mines in the Ambler region would bring, if the plug is pulled on the endeavor.
Van Nieuwenhuyse argues that lumping the proposed Ambler Road into a pile of big budget, state-funded projects, collectively known as mega-projects, is an unfair characterization of what is being proposed.
From a state spending standpoint, it is not a mega-project, he explained. It is in the neighborhood of US$10 million to permit the project, so it has a fairly modest budget.
Construction of the road, anticipated to cost US$190 million to $300 million, would be funded privately through the sale of bonds and repaid by users of the road.
A similar arrangement for the Delong Mountain Transportation System, a road and port facility linking the Red Dog zinc-lead mine to world markets, has proven to be a good investment for AIDEA and the state.
Above paying back the costs and potentially turning a profit, these infrastructure projects support economic growth and diversification in Alaska, which is AIDEAs primary objective.

CEO Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse on NovaCopper's Plans in Alaska






Resource Investing News




Aug 18, 2014 2:10 PM EDT













 




























































   NovaCopper (TSX:NCQ,NYSEMKT:NCQ), which is focused on advancing high-grade copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver properties in the Ambler Mining District of Northwest Alaska, is having a tough time this year.  Its share price is down substantially since January, and last month the company recorded a loss when it put out its second-quarter results. It said at the time that "[s]ubstantial doubt exists as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern as the continued operations and exploration activities of the Company are dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing within the next twelve months."  From an investor standpoint, that's certainly a troubling statement. However, it's worth noting that during that period NovaCopper also reduced its expenses and lowered its Q2 and half-year net losses in a year-over-year comparison.  Further, the company is still seeing support from market watchers and its largest shareholders. Case in point: just before last month's results were released, those shareholders put up cash for the entirety of NovaCopper's recent private placement, leaving the company funded for the rest of the year — at least in terms of exploration activities. Meanwhile, in an August 4 article from Seeking Alpha, the Investment Doctor points to "impressive" economics at the company's Arctic project, including a cash cost of $0.62 per pound of copper, and states that "NovaCopper is trading at a fraction of its fair value, and further achievements will unlock this value."  Finally, last Friday, NovaCopper provided an update on its summer activities, indicating that current work at Bornite is progressing well, as are the Alaska Industrial Development Export Authority's (AIDEA) efforts regarding community engagement and the Interior Energy LNG Project.  To find out more about the company and what it has planned for the Ambler Mining District, Copper Investing News (CIN) spoke with CEO Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse. Here's what he had to say.

NovaGold Resources shareholders approve NovaCopper spin-off



Washington (Platts)--29 Mar 2012 357 pm EDT/1957 GMT




Shareholders of Canadian gold miner NovaGold Resources late Wednesday
approved the spin-off of NovaCopper, NovaGold said Thursday.      The demerger of the copper subsidiary follows a November 16, 2011
NovaGold announcement that it plans to become a pure-play gold miner,
focusing on the Donlin gold deposit in Alaska.      The company owns 50% of the Donlin project, considered to be among the
large and highest-grade known open pit gold deposits in the world. Units of
NovaGold and Barrick Gold own equal shares in the Donlin project.      "In terms of size, grade, exploration potential, production profile and
jurisdictional safety, Donlin Gold is arguably the most important new gold
project in the world," NovaGold President and CEO Greg Lang said.

  When in production, as envisioned in a feasibility study completed by
NovaGold and Barrick, the project is anticipated to be among "the largest
gold producers anywhere in the world," he added.     Based on a revised feasibility study completed in December, the project
contains 33.9 million oz of proven and probable gold reserves with an
anticipated mine life of about 27 years, producing an average of 1.1 million
oz/year of gold, according to the company.     Projects owned by the new NovaCopper include the polymetallic Ambler
deposit in Alaska, as well as the Arctic and Bornite deposits, also in
northwest Alaska.      "Ambler encompasses potentially the richest known copper-dominant
polymetallic district in the world," NovaCopper President and CEO Rick Van
Nieuwenhuyse said in a statement, adding: "The environment at Ambler is one
of the most 'target-rich' I have encountered in my career as a geologist."      Under the spin-off, expected to take affect April 30, each NovaGold
shareholder will receive one NovaCopper share for each six NovaGold shares
held.--Nick Jonson, nick_jonson@platts.comTweet
