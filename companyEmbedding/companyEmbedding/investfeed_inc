Barchart OnDemand | Real-Time Data (getQuote, getHistory APIs) for investFeed


























                CASE STUDY: investFeed

Home
Case Studies













SOLUTION:  Real-time data (getQuote, getHistory)


"We are revolutionizing the way investors make trading decisions." That was the way Ronald Chernesky, CEO and Co-Founder of investFeed described the new FinTech startup he and his team created. With headquarters in New York City, investFeed is positioning themselves to become a reliable tool for anyone looking to learn more and engage within the stock market. 
The way financial information is collected and analyzed is old news and cumbersome, so investFeed decided to create a platform with a focus for not only your casual trader to access and follow reliable trading strategies and portfolios, but also for big investment players to feed members their insight and expertise.
"We give our members the power to monetize their own account and earn additional income by sharing stock predictions, articles and content," says Chernesky. "It really is a win-win situation for all of our members. The service is free for everyone with the option to subscribe to the premium members featured on our site," added Chernesky.
"We were looking for a service provider who would work with us on pricing … we wanted to make sure that we picked the right vendor."
CHALLENGE:
With getting a social FinTech startup up and running comes the challenge of finding a reliable market data vendor. With many different vendors available with a variety price ranges, products and features, investFeed started to become frustrated with the process of trying to choose a vendor that would fit their needs and requirements best.
"We were looking for a service provider who would work with us on pricing as it's very difficult for a startup to get off the ground," says Chernesky. "Market data is the biggest expense for any FinTech startup so we wanted to make sure that we picked the right vendor," Chernesky added.
SOLUTION:
After a tiring process of searching for a vendor that meets all of their requirements, investFeed came upon Barchart OnDemand, and immediately noticed the benefits associated with a company that offers cloud-based APIs, direct access to the exchanges and enterprise-class support — all at an affordable cost.
"Barchart OnDemand's service is very professional and reliable," says Chernesky. "Not only have they provided us with everything we have need data-wise, but they are also very easy to work with and get ahold of. If there's ever a question or concern, we have always received a response in a timely manner," added Chernesky.

Through Barchart OnDemand, investFeed is able to power the website with market data through reliable cloud-based APIs.
Explore the APIs investFeed uses for their platform:
getQuote
                                    With Barchart OnDemand's popular getQuote API, investFeed is able to provide users with high-quality price data for Equities.
getHistory
                                    With Barchart OnDemand's getHistory API, investFeed shows their platform's users historical price data for Equities.
TODAY:
With social investing becoming a new and popular tool in recent years, investFeed has proved themselves as a strong player in the FinTech industry and plans for continued success.
"Through our open marketplace platform we predict a majority of all investors, traders, and financial news outlets will be operating their business with us," says Chernesky. "We focus on payments while they can enjoy doing what they love without having to worry about billing — simple as that," added Chernesky.

Bankers Ditch Fat Salaries to Chase Digital Currency Riches (1)Lulu Yilun Chen and Camila RussoJul 25, 2017 8:58 pm ET(Bloomberg) -- Richard Liu gave up a seven-figure salary this month to get into one of the hottest financial instruments around right now: initial coin offerings. The former China Renaissance deal-maker has since backed a clutch of cryptocoin sales that’ve raised millions -- sometimes in seconds -- often without a single product.From Hong Kong and Beijing to London, accomplished financiers are abandoning lucrative careers to plunge into the murky world of ICOs, a way to amass quick money by selling digital tokens to investors sans banks or regulators. Cut out of the action, a growing cohort of banking professionals are instead applying their talents toward buying or hawking cryptocurrency.They’re going in with eyes wide open. For Liu, who put together some of China’s biggest tech deals in his old job, the chance to shape the nascent arena outweighs the dangers of a market crash or crackdown. Loosely akin to IPOs, ICOs have raised millions from investors hoping to get in early on the next bitcoin or ether, and their unchecked growth over the past year is such that they’ve drawn comparisons to the first ill-fated dot-com boom. Yet with stratospheric bonuses largely a thing of the past, the allure of an incandescent new arena far from financial red-tape has proven irresistible to some.“Traditional investment banks and VCs need to monitor this space closely, it could become very big,” said the 30-year-old partner at $50 million hedge fund FBG Capital, which has backed about 20 ICOs. He’s off to a quick start, getting in on this year’s largest sale: Tezos, a smart contracts platform that raised $200 million to outstrip the average Hong Kong IPO size this year of around $31 million.“Unlike the traditional financial sector, there are no ceilings or barriers. There’s so much to imagine,” he said.Critics say many ICOs are built on little more than hyperactive imaginations. A cross between crowdfunding and an initial public offering, they involve the sale of virtual coins mostly based on the ethereum blockchain, similar to the technology that underpins bitcoin. But unlike a traditional IPO in which buyers get shares, getting behind a startup’s ICO nets you virtual tokens -- like mini-cryptocurrencies -- unique to the issuing company or its network. That means they grow in value only if the startup’s business or network proves viable, attracting more people and boosting liquidity.That’s a big if, and the sheer profusion of untested concepts has spurred talk of a bubble. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission signaled greater scrutiny of the red-hot sector when it warned on Tuesday that ICOs may be considered securities, though it stopped short of suggesting a broader clampdown. The regulator however did reaffirm its focus on protecting investors: part of the appeal of ICOs lies in the fact that -- for now -- anyone with a bold idea can raise money from anybody. At least 90 ICOs have taken place this year, raising more than $1 billion based on proposals from free wi-fi sharing to trading software without a single line of code. It’s already exceeded early-stage venture capital financing. With little more than an explanation of the ad-lite browser it envisioned, Brendan Eich’s Brave Software scored $35 million for its Basic Attention Token sale in under a minute in May.“These ICOs are not selling shares, which means their investors will have to count on the promise and reliability of the founders,” said Beijing-based Chandler Guo, a bitcoin miner and angel investor who’s helped more than 20 ICOs list on cryptocurrency exchanges. So “I don’t invest in any projects unless I know where they live and their mother lives.”Justin Short, who created electronic trading algorithms for Bank of America Corp. before launching trading-related startup Nous, is preparing to launch his own sale of digital tokens to bankroll what he calls cryptoasset portfolio management. A former Wall Street floor trader, he likens the advent of ICOs to an episode half a billion years ago when many of the planet’s life forms came into existence.“It’s a Cambrian explosion of ideas. But that means you have to put in your work to figure out which one is even likely to work,” he said.Cryptocoins bypass middlemen such as fee-absorbing banks and venture capital firms, and offer access to fast money. But that also means traditional checks and balances are absent. The key may be to recognize which tokens serve an essential purpose to the selling startup’s network, and thus will appreciate in value alongside rising adoption.Former HSBC forex-trading architect Hugh Madden, currently Chief Technology Officer of Hong Kong-based ANX International, this month helped raise about $18.7 million for cryptocurrency exchange OAX. He likens ICO-token ownership to a football club membership. You don’t get special access but as the team gets better, more people become fans and the price goes up.When a football club “builds more relationships with other clubs, gets more matches, and generally enjoys wider adoption, then more people want to be a part of it,” the 40-year-old said. “There is no limit to participants, but there is a limit to memberships that allow members to exert influence on the future direction of the club.”With ICOs however, the true price of membership can be impossible to gauge. Prominent bitcoin developers including Peter Todd have pointed to coding flaws in projects. Trading platform CoinDash said hackers made off with $7 million during its ICO just this month. Hackers made off with nearly $40 million last week, stealing ICO funds from CoinDash, Swarm City, æternity, and others. And a significant number of ICOs have been underpinned by mere protocols -- operational frameworks with standard processes minus a business model.“It’s very hard to value a protocol,” said Gavin Yeung, a former Hong Kong-based trader at Deutsche Bank AG who’s weighing an ICO for his cryptocurrency index trading platform Cryptomover. “The protocol only becomes valuable if the number of users increase exponentially on the network, so unless these protocols have substantial users or awareness, these projects could end up with zero value.”The rush of speculators and get-rich-quick schemes in the space has both Yeung and Madden expecting more regulatory scrutiny. But the challenge is ICOs aren’t confined by geography. For example, OAX’s token attracted 4,400 backers across a dozen jurisdictions from China to Russia and the U.S. “It’s very hard for regulators to have an isolated policy response that’s happening on a global cross-border basis,” Madden said.Interest in ICOs remains sky-high. Ron Chernesky started his career as a trader on Wall Street 10 years ago, first on a trading floor and then running trading platform InvestFeed Inc. He’s now in the process of replacing U.S. equities trading on his platform with digital currency trading, and planned to conduct his own ICO to raise 28,000 ether -- worth roughly $6 million at current prices.“We’re completely ditching the model that we’ve been doing for the past three years and now we’re looking at cryptocurrency,” the 38-year-old said. “This is long term for us, we see this as the new gateway to the millennial way of investing and where everything is going from here.”Perhaps. Liu, the ex-China Renaissance executive, compares the ICO market to the first internet boom and bust, when startups from Webvan to Pets.com imploded and investors’ money went up in smoke. Yet it’s in part the opportunity to carve out a niche away from monolithic banking bureaucracy that’s lured him to this space.“You want to be on a rocket ship,” Liu said. “If you join early, then every day you’re making history.”(Updates with SEC warnings in seventh paragraph.)--With assistance from Yuji Nakamura ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

InvestFeed Kicks Off 'Unconventional,' Responsible, Hard Cap Token Generation Event









PR Newswire




Jul 21, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  NEW YORK, July 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --  investFeed, a New York social investing platform now replacing equities with blockchain based assets, is commencing their highly anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE) this Sunday, July 23 at 9am UTC. investFeed will conduct their TGE over 15 days, with a significant amount already committed from strategic investors. The company, founded in 2014 by a pair of highly experienced Wall Street traders, is aiming to be first to market to deliver an incentivized marketplace enabling the sharing of cryptocurrency investing ideas, peer to peer insights, market analytics, crowd sentiment, breaking news, and integrated asset portfolio/order management. Contrary to current TGE trends, investFeed will be imposing a relatively low, 28,000 Ether hard cap for their TGE, where participants will be issued FEED ($IFT) Tokens immediately.   CEO of investFeed, Ron Chernesky said, "The Token Generation Event is completely disrupting the way we think about capital raising, and in so many ways is superior to the VC model we are all used to. Our team walked away from a $5 million USD traditional raise so that we could conduct a TGE and better incentivize a growing cryptocurrency community, while selling enough tokens to build out a revolutionary platform, with a beta launching 90 days of closing. The difference between investFeed and the majority of companies conducting TGEs, is that we have imposed a low hard cap, or maximum participation amount, in the interests of responsibility, openness, transparency and honesty."    investFeed's new platform will allow the cryptocurrency community to engage with like-minded investors and enthusiasts seeking market insights, as well as providing startups and ICO prospects an invaluable channel from which to gain exposure and drive interest in their projects. Once the platform is live, FEED token holders will be able to use their tokens to access premium content, like highly-rated or high-performing investor insights, switch on advanced trader tools, and "Boost" or promote their own content.

Social Investing Equals More Opportunity For Investors


Within the past ten years, social networks have revolutionized not only the way we live, but have also altered the way we invest.

Within the past ten years, social networks have revolutionized not only the way we live, but have also altered the way we invest. These days' investment advisors have started to use networks like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to initiate the buy signal and pull the trigger. If you haven't started using these networks to invest, you're not maximizing your profits.
Back in 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission started allowing companies to use social media networks to communicate with investors. From that point on, companies started to release their quarterly reports and major corporate news on to these platforms.
Many of the industry's top bloggers use social media to inform their followers about a stock and its movement. Social media functions as a way for investors to become aware of a company's news before it becomes stale.
investFeed is to investors what Airbnb is to homes. We built the first to market transparent crowdsourced social network which empowers investors to connect multiple brokerages and share their portfolio holdings and performance, with the world. There is some privacy since the actual dollar amounts are kept hidden.
This eliminates the need to depend on brokers, advisors, or robo-advisors and don't need to rely on message boards, TV networks, or social media platforms for investment ideas where peoples' motives may not necessarily be genuine.
We aim to be the starting point of the stock market for finding reliable, on-demand information. Our growth has been driven by the great value we offer to both professional and casual investors.
Their mission is to give investors access an on-demand way to make investment decisions that's open, transparent, and crowdsourced in a way that will save retail investors $100 billion yearly in underperforming funds. In the coming months we will develop a knowledge base API that developers can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence that leverages the wisdom of the crowd to beat the markets together. The beauty of investFeed is that it provides seemingly endless options for investors to gather a wide breath of opinions and go entirely self-directed.
Crowdsourcing has been gaining steam for years, and with recent developments in artificial intelligence, we're entering a second generation of crowdsourcing, where data is more reliable and useful. The crowd is proving to beat Wall Street estimates through 'smart crowd decisions' in a fully transparent, open, and efficient environment. Everyone will now have the ability to contribute their views of each others portfolios in a structured format that will better represent the billion dollar Wall Street advisory industry.
Between crowdsourced ideas offered for free and various flavors of artificial intelligence (coming soon), we may be predicting the future. If you thought you might have a serious illness, would you trust your health to a website? or a platform that will provide feedback in seconds from a smart crowd?
investFeed the New Twitter?
Recently, a new social network for investing has surfaced, investFeed. InvestFeed is changing the way investors make trading decisions, and investFeed is revolutionizing the trading industry as a whole. The long days are gone of running across the street to buy newspapers, calling your broker, and flipping on the TV to find up-to-date news on companies, firms and stocks. That system is archaic, disorganized and above all, it's costing time, which makes it difficult to collect relevant information in real-time unless you are a professional.
Many hedge funds and premier newsletter services have already started to shift their business over to investFeed. At investFeed it's all about "transparency." Which in investFeed's opinion is the ability to, simply put, be honest.
InvestFeed's CEO and Founder, Ronald Chernesky comments:
The transparency of an investor or traders motives. For example if a member says they are bullish/buying $AAPL and the position goes against them it will reflect in their overall portfolio on investFeed.
Everyone on investFeed will be able to see this creating a transparent environment where no one can lie or try to deceive others about their actual results.
Social investing got light back in 2013, after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed companies to start tweeting.
While following opinions of someone else has a risk attached to it, everything decision you take needs to be thoughtfully thought out. In addition, you always to back the information up with other sources and logical reasoning, again, transparency is the case.
The case in the past with social media has been millions of users' login to Twitter to check the status of a celebrity breakup or to get a chuckle out of a joke, but now that social media has crossed the stage of infancy, people have started to create an even wider use of it.
Publicly-traded companies have even started to use their investors' relations department to spread the information. Some companies have even started to use social media to launch their products. From here on out, the sharing of information will only increase and things will only become more transparent.

investFeed, Inc.: We Created the First Marketplace Platform to Revolutionize the Financial Markets11 Sep, 2015  in  icnw  tagged  icrowdnewswire   by admin  

investFeed, Inc.

 
COMPANY OVERVIEW

Twitter for finance where you can subscribe to and copy the stock moves of top investors, or earn from followers who subscribe to you! 
Why We Started This Company
As stock investors, we constantly worry about the credibility of the people who give us investment advice. Wall Street bombards us with the “next big stock idea” whether it comes from TV networks, high profile traders or financial advisors. What most people don’t understand is the motivations of these individuals or even if they have a history of trading success. Both founders of worked together in the financial markets for over a decade and became tired of the deception. They developed investFeed to address these problems by creating a platform that provides members with full transparency every time someone makes a trade. With investFeed, everyone can now see the actual trading history of other individuals in order to help in determining who are the most successful people at generating a profit. It gives investors a means of knowing which traders and investors are the right ones to listen to. With investFeed, there is no more wondering!
What Sets Us Apart
This groundbreaking concept of an open and free marketplace for stock traders and investors is changing the world of stock investing. With investFeed, every investor will have the opportunity to not only demonstrate and track their own stock trading ability but also directly profit from it by developing a subscriber base willing to pay a monthly fee to follow their own trading activity.
For users, investFeed provides a means of determining for themselves who the most successful stock traders really are. They are then able to subscribe to these traders’ feeds in order to receive real time trade alerts, updates on positions held and thoughts on the markets in general.
It provides both sides the full transparency that is missing from so many Wall Street institutions. The ability for investors to know that the advice they’re following is backed by a truly successful track record along with the ability for traders to generate a monthly income for themselves based on their own trading success is a real differentiator for investFeed.
Our Keys To Success
investFeed currently supports thousands of users. One key to success will be the ability to scale our platform to include many additional trading vehicles such as futures, options and currencies as well as expand into other parts of the industry such as robo-advisory. Another key to success will be large scale distribution of our product. While our direct consumer marketing has proven the demand for investFeed, we will look to gain distribution through large channel partners with a global reach such as financial institutions, hedge funds, quantitative firms and retail broker-dealers. We are currently in active negotiations with several prospective partners.


Summary: With investFeed, everyone can now see the actual trading history of other individuals in order to help in determining who are the most successful people at generating a profit. It gives investors a means of knowing which traders and investors are the right ones to listen to. With investFeed, there is no more wondering!
