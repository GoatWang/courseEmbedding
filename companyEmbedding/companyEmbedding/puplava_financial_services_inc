	INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS
Broker/dealer Puplava Securities, Inc., member FINRA/SIPC primarily transacts business in:


		Equities (stocks, including preferreds)

		Cash and cash equivalents (money market)

		Income instruments (master limited partnerships, royalty trusts, bonds, convertible bonds)

		Foreign investments (currencies, foreign government bonds, foreign equities)

		Funds and fund-like instruments (mutual funds, exchange traded funds, exchange traded notes, unit investment trusts)

		Options

		Warrants

		Bullion/coins

Other investment products may be considered to be appropriate investment vehicles under specific situations.
Some portfolios may hold "penny stocks" (i.e. "low price securities"), which involve unique risks.

	PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS
Portfolio holdings vary according to investment approach and market conditions and may include—but are not limited to:

Sectors


		Basic Materials (such as chemicals; gold; silver; minerals; oil;  gas; oil & gas drilling & exploration, equipment & services, pipelines, refining & marketing; steel; iron)

		Industrial Goods (such as aerospace/defense, machinery, building materials, contractors, construction, electrical equipment & components, lumber/wood, tools, metal fabrication, pollution & treatment, waste management)

		Consumer Goods (such as beverages, business equipment, cleaning products, dairy, electronics, farm products, food, meat products, office supplies, paper & paper products, personal products, rubber & plastics, toys & games, vehicles)

		Utilities (such as electricity, gas, water)

		Services (such as apparel, broadcasting, department and other stores, drug stores, entertainment, grocery stores, travel, marketing, management, publishing, railroads, airlines, restaurants)

		Healthcare (such as biotechnology; diagnostic substances & equipment; pharmaceuticals; health care plans; hospitals; medical appliances & equipment, instruments & supplies, laboratories & research)

		Technology (such as software, communication equipment, data storage, electronics, information delivery and support services, internet service providers, long-distance carriers, networking and communication devices, personal computers, circuit boards, technical instruments, semiconductors, telecommunications, wireless communications)

		Financials (such as insurance, credit services, banks & savings & loans, asset management firms, real estate investment trusts)

Allocations to sectors and sector selections are subject to change as we try to respond to current (or perceived future) market conditions. (Our Investment Strategy section provides more details on when these changes might occur.)

	GLOBAL STOCK EXCHANGES & CURRENCIES
In non-retirement accounts, Puplava Securities, Inc. is able to trade foreign currencies and to transact business on many exchanges around the world. Please contact us for more detailed information.

	PORTFOLIO TURNOVER
Portfolio turnover is directly linked to market conditions. Difficult market conditions may result in a higher number of trades; smooth market conditions may result in fewer trades. Due to our investment philosophy, we typically tend to hold positions for the intermediate to long term, although there are short-term trades when warranted by market conditions. For accounts over which we have discretion, we reserve the right to pull out of the markets and hold a partial or full cash position, should we feel market conditions warrant such a move. Similarly, we may hold positions we consider to be "core positions" to the portfolio regardless of market conditions.
Our Investment Strategy section provides more details on when and why portfolio turnover may occur.

	REPORTING & COMMUNICATION
We keep our transactions in your portfolio as transparent as possible. As a client, you will be kept up-to-date on your investments via:


		Online access to your account holdings, monthly statements, trade confirmations, tax documentation, and select Fidelity research through our clearing firm’s (National Financial Services, LLC) client website, www.myStreetscape.com.

		Monthly statements and confirmations of trades mailed to you by our clearing firm.

		For Jim Puplava's clients, our client-only "In the Know" newsletter, available on the Client Site at www.puplava.com. Clients with discretionary accounts with Jim Puplava not only receive information when a buy, sell, or wait is decided, but also an explanation of the why behind the trading decision as well. However, in specialty accounts, such as the Precious Metals Managed Account or the Energy Managed Account, trading coverage is limited. Trading coverage also is limited for non-discretionary accounts.

		For Jim Puplava's clients, quarterly portfolio newsletters from members of the trading & management team.

		Semi-annual performance updates (for fee-based PAM accounts only).

		Staff accessibility for questions about your investments.


	OTHER FEES & COSTS
Our clearing firm, National Financial Services LLC, and its affiliates may charge annual fees or interest to act as custodian/trustee/provider of certain types of accounts, such as Keogh, IRA, margin, or check writing/credit card accounts; in some cases, account closure fees may apply.
Annual bullion/coin storage fees and storage fee minimums may apply; bullion/coin holdings may also be subject to "use tax."
Delivery of or changes to certain assets in the account (stock certificates, bullion/coins, or other assets) may involve additional delivery, processing, or shipping fees.
Other fees, charges, and costs may also apply.

	CLEARING SERVICES
Accounts are carried by National Financial Services LLC, Member NYSE/SIPC.

                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
