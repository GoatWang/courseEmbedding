Wine Profile

Tasting Notes
The 2014 “E” OV Zin explodes from the glass with penetrating aromas of raspberry liqueur and black cherry preserves that carry through to the flavors, with added hints of roots and black pepper spice. The mouth-feel is soft and rich with bright acidity, leading to a long finish. This vintage is ready to enjoy now, and will age well for 7+ years.


Ratings
"Offers subtle, brooding power, combined with blackberry and licorice aromas and deep flavors of baking spices and smoky plum. Drink now through 2027. 340 cases made. T.F." 91 points, Wine Spectator


Vineyard Notes
The Enkidu “E” wines are crafted in the same style of all of our wines, with balance, complexity, and harmony. The 2014 Sonoma County Old Vine Zinfandel is just that. With an average vine age of over 75 years, this blend of 75% Zinfandel, 15% Carignan, 6% Alicante Bouschet and 4% Petite Sirah is as the vineyards are planted. An incredible amount was known by the growers of many decades ago about the benefits of blending different varietals, but instead of blending individual varietal wines after they were fermented, the vineyards were inter-planted varietals at the proportions the growers/wine producers desired. Included in this complex blend is fruit from the Bedrock Vineyard at 128 years of age. These are the venerable vineyards of California that are capable of producing profound wines of which we are proud and excited to offer.


Production Notes
With our OVZin there is no separation on varietals: they are crushed and co-fermented 
together. We performed a four-day cold soak after we completely de-stemmed all the fruit, and once the native fermentation commenced we performed punch downs twice daily. After three weeks we pressed directly to barrel, of which 20% were one year old French Oak. We performed only three rackings off the gross lees and splashed heavily as we returned the wine to barrel. Bottling occurred 17 months after fermentation. This wine is un-fined with minimal, coarse filtration only
