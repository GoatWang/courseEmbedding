Laurel Grove Capital - Philosophy





We believe in purchasing excellent businesses at 
    reasonable prices — businesses that are run by able and 
    honest people whose interests are aligned with our own. 
    When we buy a stock, we are buying the business behind 
    the stock, not a piece of paper. If the business does well 
    over time, the stock price will follow.    
We do not limit ourselves with respect to size, style or 
    region, but make purchases based on inherent investment 
    merit. We seek businesses that enjoy a strong competitive 
    advantage. Since a majority of equities are found outside 
    the United States, we also include high quality foreign 
    companies that meet our investment standards.


In buying fixed income securities, we include only 
    the highest quality corporate, agency, government and 
    municipal bonds, as we do not engage in speculation in 
    either our stock or bond purchases.    
Each separately managed account is designed to honor 
    the client's specific preferences or restrictions. Whether 
    for an individual or a non-profit organization, we tailor 
    our investments either to take advantage of tax free
    status or to mitigate tax consequences. Our aim is to 
    forge a partnership with our clients in which we help
    them achieve their long-term financial goals in the 
    safest and most secure way possible.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
