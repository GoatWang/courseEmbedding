                                Report abuseTranscript of The Product Model of CurriculumThe Product Model of CurriculumThe Product ModelAlso referred to as the behavioural objectives model.Became apparent in the late 1960s due to:- The vagueness of many syllabuses- The need to specify practical skills more precisely- The need to make assessment techniques more precise- The influence of the ideas of behaviourismHowever, this was also developed by Tyler (1949), he shared his emphasis on rationality and relative simplicity.His theory was based on 4 fundamental questions:1. What educational purposes should the school seek to attain?2. What educational experiences can be provided that are likely to attain these purposes?3. How can these educational experiences be effectively organized?4. How can we determine whether these purposes are being attained?It used to be that there were certain skills to master and facts to know. Knowledge was seen as something similar to a product that is manufactured. Generally, one starts knowing nothing, is taught, and one transmits that knowledge to action. For the most part, this point of view worked for quite some time, as it organized learning quite neatly.There were a series of steps leading to the product, and curriculum could be designed accordingly. Those steps were:Step 1: Diagnosis of needStep 2: Formulation of objectivesStep 3: Selection of contentStep 4: Organization of contentStep 5: Selection of learning experiencesStep 6: Organization of learning experiencesStep 7: Determination of what to evaluate, and the ways and means of doing it.ConcernOne problem with the product orientation is that students are generally left out of the picture. The product model, by having a pre-specified plan or program, tends to direct attention to teaching. For example, the focus is on: how the information is given.If this model is tightly adhered to there can be limited opportunities for educators to make use of the interactions that occur. It can also de-skill the educators!Therefore, it turns educators into technicians.PositivesThe advantages of the use of behavioural objectives in curriculum planning may include:- Avoidance of vague, general statements of intent- Making assessment more precise- Helping to select and structure contentThe Product Model of Curriculum DevelopmentThe product model has its origins in the writings of Ralph Tyler. Tyler’s Basic Principles of Curriculum Instruction (1949) greatly influenced curriculum development in America. This model is also known as an objectives curriculum model and looks at curriculum as a technical exercise. Key features of this model include: High level of lecturer/teacher planning Emphasis on defining/setting appropriate learning objectives Use of behavioural language Precise assessment instruments Emphasis plans and intentions – selecting and organising of learningexperiences The curriculum, essentially, is a set of documents for implementation: one-size-fits-all package of learning Outcomes (product) are measured – evaluation.SummaryThe curriculum as product model id heavily dependant on the setting of behavioural objectives.Therefore, the curriculum is essentially a set of documents for implementation.In other words curriculum is what actually happens in the classroom and what people do to prepare and evaluate.Full transcriptMore presentations by

She has been not just short but flat out rude and insensitive, called me names, and has gone so far as to hang up on me without ever asking why I was calling. I have never met someone that treated people with such disregard in my entire life. She has no business being in the health care industry, especially one that deals with people that are already unstable. It seems as if her sole goal is make people cry or snap. She will not connect you to the doctor, and belittles you when you show up for an appointment. I know I am not the only one that has had to deal with this. I urge all of you to voice your concerns to Dr. Wier. His other receptionist is great, I have no idea why he hired this additional woman, but she needs to go before all his patients do. It is a shame to have to lose a doctor you really admire and trust because dealing with this woman is unbearable.As for Dr. Wier, he is a great psychiatrist. He really works with you to find a treatment that works for you. If you have already found medication that works for you and are just switching doctors, he listens, reads your files, and doesn't make you restart the whole process (which in changing health insurance companies I ran into that problem a lot with doctors wanting to start the diagnose process all over rather than listening to what has and has not helped you in the past). His appointments are a little shorter than some as he seems to deal more with people that have seen a psychiatrist for years and are already set with a treatment plan or are also in other forms of therapy, BUT if you do need additional time just to talk you can schedule it and he will gladly listen to you and help. He is very caring, compassionate, and understanding. I know some people at times need to just be able to talk for a hour or more, and if you need that additional therapy he will give good recommendations for doctors and centers that specialize in your condition. As for someone who knows medication, listens to you, and works with you, Dr. Wier can't be beat.  Mididoddi, Ravi, MDRebecca A. ratedI'm writing this review from the perspective of both my mother - a patient of Dr. Mididoddi - and myself - as a family member of one of Dr. Mididoddi's patients.  My mum is a kidney transplant patient who experienced some difficulties, including hospitalization, in the first few years after her transplant.  During one of these hospitalizations, my mum had the good luck of being seen by Dr. Mididoddi.  He took the time to familiarize himself with her history and the facts and circumstances that caused her hospitalization.  Upon meeting with her at the hospital he was compassionate, competent, and knowledgeable. Dr. Mididoddi continues to be my mum's favorite doctor.  He is concerned about my mother's overall well-being and not just the health of her kidney.  Dr. Mididoddi has done a wonderful job of referring my mum to additional doctors, when necessary, and strives for a cohesive and balanced approach to her healthcare.Prisacaru, Genoveva N, MDDaniella M. ratedI would wholeheartedly recommend Dr.  Prisacaru  at Seven Hills Women's Health. She is  intelligent and so well read and the best communicators of medical information that I have ever seen, with a natural talent for breaking down any difficult topics.Each interaction with her during my pregnancy was an opportunity to learn and take away a treasure chest of unique insights. Behind her brilliant mind is a very caring individual. Many people are intimidated by her because she is so incredibly smart. I am grateful and fortunate to have been her patient. Let aside, she saved my life twice. Once in ICU, when I was admitted with severe pelvic sepsis, and second time when she operated on me for my fourth cesarian section.   I am one of her  living legacies. Hill Country Allergy and AsthmaGeorge R. ratedMy son has been suffering thru allergies for over a year and we just dealt with the sneezing and coughing. When we decided to take that step toward seeing a doctor, Dr. Mery was recommended. As a parent, I am so satisfied we took that step. Dr. Mery not only took the time to answer my concerns but also explained our options to my son's better health.  I am submitting this review when I usually do not bother, however I am compelled to share due to my son's much improved health with the allergy shot therapy.  Being on the allergy therapy is a commitment, but the gains we have seen are huge.Cordoba J Bernard MDhopehope ratedDr. J. Bernard Cordoba is an o...Dr. J. Bernard Cordoba is an outstanding, gifted psychiatrist.  He has offered me the most healing, help, and hope since my diagnosis of bipolar disorder in 2006.  Dr. Cordoba is a very good listener and at the beginning of each appointment takes the time to talk with me and ask me questions before making recommendations about medication and self-care. Dr. Cordoba is extremely well-versed in prescribing the most effective yet least intrusive medical cocktail.  We make all decisions together regarding my treatment.  I absolutely trust Dr. Cordoba and am truly thankful for him.  Rouhani, ShawnMatthew W. ratedI first saw Dr. Rouhani on a whim after driving by his office years ago, and have returned here two more times for his prompt service and pleasant manner. This office has the same modern bells and whistles as the boutique eye care center I went to on a Groupon, but Rouhani still takes his time re-checking the machines' guesses on my prescription and eye health with his own investigation. Did I mention I've been coming back for years? I like 'em!Hemkumar Sasi MDAbril F. ratedLove this Dr so much this is my 3rd pregnancy but my first n Austin and she is hands down the best this pregnancy is different then my other two n I felt I had more concerns n every weird thing I went to see her and she never made me feel like how I was feeling was stupid she would even take the time out to call me to see if I was feeling better.

All the equipment is new and state of the art. The entire staff is friendly and professional. All appointments *never* delayed; every one was right on time. Actually, Dr.  would not have accepted anything less than perfect. What a wonderful office! What a wonderful experience!Wachtel, Julie K, MDAngie M. ratedTreated me Burnet, TX/Seton for a severe upper respiratory infection/asthma issue. Could not ask for a better doctor. I am checking to see if she has a private practice,  and whether she is accepting new patients. I am more than willing to drive over 65 miles to see her. She is that good!!! Absolutely loved her!!!Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
