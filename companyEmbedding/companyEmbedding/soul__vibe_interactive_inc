Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc.  Company Overview
Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc., [publicly traded on OTCQB: SOUL] is an innovative video and computer games company focused on developing and publishing standout games. Our games are as fun to talk about, as they are to play.

"Soul and Vibe" specializes in the creation of original intellectual properties ("IPs") and has extensive experience licensing world-renowned brands from influential companies.  Through partnerships with technically sophisticated software developers located all over the world, we transform unique concepts into engaging, highly accessible, and affordable, games and entertainment experiences.

Historically, gaming has meant playing retail purchased physical media on television-based and portable consoles, and personal computers. Consumer behavior is trending away from physical media, and is embracing digitally distributed products. Mobile devices, once used only for communication, now play host to myriad features, and allow access to a wealth of “on demand” entertainment choices. Mobile devices are significantly expanding the hardware platforms on which games are played, as well as the consumer base that plays them.

Soul and Vibe’s business model focuses on multi-platform support. Our licensed-brand and original IP-based games can be played on consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers. Each product is supported by a recurring release of monetized games-related content:


Ancillary revenue is generated from the sale of Premium Downloadable Content (“PDLC”), virtual apparel and costumes for Avatars, and monetized “Consumables.” Our business model calls for numerous revenue streams to be generated from each game release.
Our mobile games are revenue generating marketing vehicles for our console releases.
Through "Smart Glass" and "Companion App" support, we broaden consumer awareness for each game franchise, promote interconnectivity between hardware platforms for our games, and amortize development and marketing expenses.
“IP” ownership allows us to control the licensing of our properties to 3rd Party merchandising companies, and to retain the majority of revenues, maximizing shareholder value.

The video and computer games industry is very mature when it comes to distributing and marketing interactive content at retail (30+ years). However, it is in its infancy when it comes to digitally distributing and marketing the same content. Soul and Vibe was founded with a business model that fully embraces digital distribution. Digital distribution significantly reduces the Cost of Goods Sold (“COGS”), bypasses physical media distribution channel challenges, and directs sales, marketing, and promotional efforts directly to the consumer.

PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) reports consumer spending on console, mobile, and personal computer game software topped $56 billion in 2010. Games Industry revenue is projected to reach $82 billion by the year 2015. Soul and Vibe’s leadership, business model, multi-platform focus, and strategic relationships, will pave the way for the Company to be a significant player in the video and computer games industry.

Yahoo! FinanceQuote for SOUL/



Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc. is a video and computer games company.

Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc., [publicly traded on OTCQB: SOUL] publishes games and games-related content for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers. Our product mix includes licensed-brands and internally generated, wholly owned, intellectual properties. Our games are as fun to talk about, as they are to play.

What’s the meaning behind our name?

Soul. The gaming media states, “Games either do, or do not, have a soul.” Soul is akin to personality. It is the thing that makes it stand out.

The perception of soul in a game is directly tied to the fun-factor of its core play mechanic (what you do as a user while playing).

The more engaging and compelling the play mechanic, the more robust, personable, and memorable the play experience, and the more likely consumers and press will talk about the game.

Vibe. The ways in which players hear and talk about games has changed, significantly, in recent years. Consumers have an internal information filter that is becoming more refined by the day.

Buzz is measured more by traffic volume on social networks, tweets, and hobbyist sites/forums than: Impressions left by ads in magazines consumers aren’t reading, banner ads users aren’t “clicking-through” on websites, and television commercials the populace skips thanks to DVR. 

Soul and Vibe breaks through marketplace clutter and noise via direct-to-consumer tactics that reverberate from the core player to the mainstream gaming audience. Soul and Vibe makes games as fun to talk about, as they are to play.

Yahoo! FinanceQuote for SOUL/



“Video games will be the fastest-growing and most exciting form of media over the next decade.”- The Economist, December 10, 2011

PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) reports consumer spending on console, mobile, and personal computer game software, topped $56 billion in 2010. This revenue represents:

More than 2X the size of the music industry.
Almost 1/4 more than what is earned by the global magazine business.
Nearly 3/5 the size of the entire film industry (including Blu-Ray and DVD sales and box-office receipts).

Games Industry revenue is projected to reach $82 billion by the year 2015, according to PwC.
Sales revenues are receiving increased contributions from digital downloads, game content subscription services, social network games, and “App” sales, as opposed to strictly retail sales.
In 2010, sales of game downloads, game “Apps,” and various games played over social networks, earned approximately $15.6 billion in revenue.

“The stereotypical image of the gamer – teenaged, male and probably rather nerdy – is no longer accurate, if it ever was.”- The Entertainment Software Association (ESA)

The world’s largest gaming market is North America. American consumers are projected to spend $14.1B on games in ’12.

The average age of game players in the U.S. is 37.
42% of the U.S. gaming audience is female.
72% of U.S. households play games (mobile, console, or computer).
1 in 3 adults over 50 play games.

Consoles dominate in Britain (the fifth largest gaming market) and are very strong across Europe. In Germany, and many other European countries, computer gaming is dominant.
Computer games, especially those played online, dominate in China and Korea. China is the second largest gaming market in the world, and the fastest growing. South Korea is fourth.
The launch of the Wii (2006) and Xbox 360 Kinect (2010) targeted female, family (specifically “under 12”), and “new adopter” or “mature” players. This broadened the gaming demographic.

Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc. looks to VR to Grow Product Portfolio

A new developer joins the virtual reality community.

By Peter Graham 
On Jun 20, 2016





HTC ViveOculus RiftSoul and Vibe Interactive Inc. 

Developing virtual reality (VR) projects are becoming a far more viable option for videogame studios looking to expand their roster of titles. You only need to look at the recent Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2016 to see how many companies are seriously pushing the technology. Today videogame publisher/developer Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc. has announced plans to expand its portfolio into VR.
Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc. creates not only games but also music and interactive books, and its VR plans include offerings for both the former and latter of the three.

“We anticipate participation in the VR market will provide Soul and Vibe another mechanism through which our operations can further expand and the Company can generate a recurring release calendar. said Soul and Vibe’s CEO and President, Peter Anthony (“Tony”) Chiodo in a statement. As we have stated previously, we anticipate a recurring release calendar will help drive revenue, set-up cross-promotional opportunities for our products, and build brands.”
The company has announced it’s developing projects for both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift head-mounted displays (HMDs) in two categories. They are highly engaging interactive experiences and fully immersive spectator experiences. While not revealing any further details, Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc. has said the VR projects will be based on licensed-brands and the firms proprietary IPs.
“As a Company, we are very excited about the market potential for VR product. We view the VR platform as a great way to further transition Soul and Vibe into a very robust content company with a cross section of highly valuable IP,” added Chiodo. “We are actively speaking with development partners about two unique product categories: Highly engaging interactive experiences and fully immersive spectator experiences. We look forward to revealing more details about our plans for VR products shortly.”
As Soul and Vibe Interactive Inc. reveals further details, VRFocus will bring you the latest.
