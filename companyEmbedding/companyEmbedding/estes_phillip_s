			Mr. Estes has been a director of the LLC since 2006 and he became a member of our Board of Directors in 2014 in connection with the IPO. He co-founded Horizon Holdings, LLC, which has acquired 15 companies in the food and beverage and consumer products industries since its formation in 1989.

He has also served on the board of the National Marine Manufacturers Association ("NMMA"), a boating industry trade association, since 2007. Prior to founding Horizon Holdings, Mr. Estes was a vice president in the corporate finance department of Drexel Burnham Lambert. He received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and a B.S. from the University of Oklahoma. Based on his extensive experience investing in and advising manufacturing companies, his deep knowledge of Malibu Boats given his ten-year tenure as a member of the board of the LLC, his service on the board of the NMMA and his enthusiasm for our business as a life-long active boater, we believe Mr. Estes is qualified to serve on our Board.

The 1000Bulbs.com Difference

The quality you need. We carry lighting products by Sylvania, GE Lighting, Philips Lighting, and many more trusted manufacturers.
The affordable prices you want. Our extremely low prices reflect our number one goal: Making quality lighting affordable to everyone!
A huge selection and helpful application information. We have thousands of lights and lighting accessories to fit your specific needs.
Lighting that saves you money. Our energy-saving compact fluorescents and LED bulbs can drastically reduce your energy costs and help protect the environment.

Selecting the Right Bulb
Incandescent
Incandescent bulbs, which provide most home lighting, are used in products from nightlights to floodlights. The most common incandescent is a pear-shaped (A19) bulb with a medium-sized screw-type base. Incandescent lights use electricity to heat a filament until it glows white hot, producing light. About 90 percent of the electricity used by incandescent bulbs is lost as heat. This style typically burns for 750 to 10,000 hours.
Halogen
Halogen bulbs contain a small capsule filled with Halogen gas, which emits a bright white light. Long life and full spectrum Halogen bulbs use less energy and last longer than standard incandescent bulbs of the same wattage. The life of these bulbs is around 2,000 to 10,000 hours or two to five years.
Linear Fluorescent
Linear fluorescent bulbs, also known as fluorescent tubes, are more energy efficient than incandescents or halogens because they don't produce much heat. These are the thin, long tube lights often found in kitchens for under-cabinet lighting, or in garages, workshops, and basements. The tubes can last from 10,000 to 44,000 hours—10 to 40 times longer than incandescent lights. Fluorescent bulbs require and are powered by fluorescent ballasts.
Compact Fluorescent
Compact fluorescents, also known as CFLs, provide as much light as regular incandescent bulbs while using just one-fourth of the energy. For example, a 15-watt compact fluorescent light bulb yields the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. Compact fluorescent bulbs last about 10,000 hours—10 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
High Intensity Discharge
High intensity discharge, or HID, bulbs include metal halide, high pressure sodium, and mercury vapor lights. As their name implies, HID bulbs emit a very large amount of light using relatively little power. They are a mainstay of parking lot, street, and warehouse lighting. Like fluorescent bulbs, HID bulbs also require a ballast.
Stage and Studio
Stage bulbs and photography lights are specialized, high output lights used in the entertainment industry as well as in just about any stage or photography studio. Traditionally, these bulbs have used Halogen or HID technology, though LED stage lights are becoming more common.
Miniature Indicator
Miniature indicator bulbs are found in everything from heavy machinery to instrument panels. Though we carry hundreds of miniature bulbs, you can find the replacement you need by identifying the numeric code stamped on the base of your old bulb.
Automotive
Automotive bulbs include everything from Halogen headlight capsules to the tiny incandescent bulbs that go in makeup mirrors and everything in between. No matter the make or model of your car, we have the bulb that fits.

Benefits of LED Lighting
LED light bulbs can save you money not only because they are roughly 80% more energy efficient than other bulbs, they also produce far less heat than metal halides, CFLs, and incandescent light bulbs. Upgrading to LED lighting means you won’t spend your summer months cooling down rooms that your light bulbs are busy heating up. While originally a cooler blue tone than incandescent bulbs, LEDs now come in daylight and warm white color temperatures so you can more easily replace your existing bulbs without altering the color of your room. Visit our Lighting Guide to see what difference color temperature makes. LED lighting also offers a superior color rendering index (CRI), so you can see the colors of your artwork or makeup more accurately.
LED replacement bulbs are durable and ecologically friendly. Did you know you can recycle LED bulbs and reduce your carbon footprint up to one third? LEDs outlast the competition, staying bright for up to 11 years of continuous operation. This means less time climbing ladders trying to replace those hard to reach bulbs in vaulted ceilings. 
 LEDs are one of today’s most promising technologies.

No mercury, making them a cleaner alternative to fluorescent and CFL lamps.
The lowest energy consumption of any lighting product to date.
Light quality equal or superior to traditional lighting products.
Life that is 20 times than some traditional lighting products.



LEDs or Fluorescents - Which is More Efficient?


LED light bulbs for the win! When it comes to purchasing energy-efficient lighting, LEDs surpass CFLs by a wide margin. LEDs are instant-start with no warmup time needed. They work well in cold weather, and are substantially more durable since manufactured out of plastic instead of glass. From standard bulbs to fluorescent tubes, LEDs can replicate the same lighting conditions found in fluorescents while lasting longer and using less energy. As an added bonus, all LEDs are RoHS compliant and do not use mercury, a claim that can't be made by fluorescent bulbs.

LED Lighting Options




Standard Shape A19
 - Designed to give the appearance and pattern of a standard incandescent bulb. Standard and A-shape LED bulbs fit the same sockets and fixtures as your current household lights.



3-Way LED
 - A three-way bulb is a light bulb that has two brightness settings instead of the standard on or off. If your lamp or fixture says it requires a three-way bulb, this is the category for you.



Vintage LED Bulbs
- Vintage reproduction bulbs are now available with LED filament. They have a warm orange glow with lower light levels to mimic the style of a vintage bulb on a dimmer as it transitions from yellow to orange. These
Edison style and
Victorian style bulbs make great collector items. Order yours today to make your own steampunk lighting.



Wet Location LED Bulbs
 - A wet location UL rating means these LED light bulbs can be used in humid indoor areas or outdoors where water may drop or flow against the bulb or fixture.



Decorative LED Bulbs
 - Browse
LED globe lights ranging from 3 in. to 1.5 in. diameters or find LED replacement bulbs for your
chandelier light bulbs. The long life of LEDs mean less time on the ladder changing burnt out bulbs. Many LED chandelier lights are dimmer switch compatible and come in a range of color temperature so you can still enjoy the ambiance of traditional bulbs but the energy savings of LEDs.



LED Tubes
 - LED tubes are the emerging standard for commercial and household lighting. Ranging in size from T5 to T12 and a variety of color temperatures, these LED tubes are an easy way to upgrade to energy efficient lighting. Some of them work with or without an existing ballast, making the transition to LED lighting easier than ever. These LED tubes emit the same amount of light as fluorescent T8s, while using a fraction of the power and lasting up to three times longer. LED tubes are especially effective in cold areas like refrigeration lockers where fluorescent tubes are less efficient at producing light.



LED Tape Lights
 - For accents, alcove, and backlighting, LED tape light is a fantastic choice. More flexible than rope light and bright enough for accent illumination, a strip of LED tape light can bring any place to life. There are countless uses and applications for this easily installed new light source.



Shatter Resistant LED Bulbs
 - Dipped in a special coating, these bulbs may still break if dropped, but they won’t shatter into pieces and fly across your floor. We recommend not dropping them, but if you do, these make cleanup quite a bit easier.



LED Night Lights
 - Keep the monsters away with LED night lights. Motion activated, and battery powered, these LED bulbs will light the way to the bathroom or give reassurance that nothing is lurking under the bed when your child needs to reach for a dropped retainer or teddy bear. Mounted using tape or screws, light only the area you need without waking sleeping babies.



Reflectors
 - From the powerful flood and spot lights, to home bound recessed or track lights, reflectors find excellent use indoors or out. LED reflector lamps can provide the same brilliance for less energy and will create far less heat than an incandescent or halogen lamp. As a bonus, they have a higher CRI than fluorescent reflectors for better colors.


Shop by Brand - Shop top brands for LED light bulbs including
Cree and
Soraa. Watch installation videos for help retrofitting an existing structure or give us a call to talk to a licensed electrician.



Things to Consider When Buying LED Lighting




Equivalent Wattage - While lumens are the new standard, it helps to have an easily recognizable guide. Comparing an LED bulb to an incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room. As a very ballpark figure for LED wattages, 1/4 or 1/5 the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need.


Lumens - Lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total. On average, a 60-watt incandescent shines at 800 lumens, with roughly 50-100 lumens of difference above or below. The variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp. LEDs are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb.


Color Temperature - Your guide to how the light itself will look. Lower values are warmer, with 2700-3000K being a more incandescent "warm white" while higher temperatures like 5000K will deliver a very harsh "stark white" light. Our  Lighting Guide lets you select a color temperature and see how it transforms a kitchen.
        

Driver Content - Because of their design, LEDs do not typically run on AC voltage.  Many LEDs require some form of 
            driver to convert the voltage from AC to DC for proper operation.  The majority of socket-based LED lamps are self-driven, but you should always check before buying to make sure that you buy both an LED and a 
            driver
             at the same time if it isn't self-driven.
